1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,299
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,909
I found the wire on the beach.

3
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,884
I thought it might have something to do
with a transmission we picked up,

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,354
a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 16 years.

5
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,754
Has it really been that long?

6
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,156
Have you seen other people
on this island?

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:31,994
No. But I hear them.
They whisper.

8
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,625
- We need to get off.
- Are you suggesting something?

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,135
Yeah. We build a raft.

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,570
- You're making a lot of progress.
- Yeah, trying.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,369
Got this bamboo for the decking,

12
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,309
a piece of the fuselage
for the cabin.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,970
It'll work. We can do this.

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,776
It's been raining every afternoon.

15
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,817
That means that we are on
the cusp of monsoon season.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,185
Why are we listening to Arzt? You're
a damn high school science teacher.

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,156
I was assuming you
didn't want to die.

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,125
- So when do we have to leave?
- Yesterday.

19
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,207
<i>Yeah! All right! </i>

20
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,815
- What're you doing?
- Watching TV.

21
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,879
<i>- Yeah! Oh, yeah! 
- Yeah! The power's amazing! </i>

22
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:34,017
Oh, man, you see what time it is?
Go back to sleep, Walt.

23
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,459
I always watch this show.

24
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,894
Okay, then.

25
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:39,795
Could you at least
turn it down?

26
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,434
I said turn it down, Walt.

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:49,907
- Brian lets me watch it as loud as...
- I'm not Brian.

28
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,569
- Dang.
- Let's go, Vincent.

29
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,476
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

30
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,639
Walt!

31
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,980
- Get away. Leave me alone.
- Don't even... Don't you think...

32
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,452
- I said get away.
- Don't you walk away.

33
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,614
I don't think so. Come on.

34
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,920
- Get off of me!
- I don't like this either.

35
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,722
- But you're getting on that plane.
- What's going on?

36
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,787
- It's okay. I'm his father.
- You're not my father!

37
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,924
You're not my father!

38
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,189
- Dad, wake up!
- What?

39
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,916
Somebody's here.

40
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,396
Hey! Hey! Stop!

41
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,694
Slow, slow down.

42
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,896
- Who is that?
- Gotta be the French chick.

43
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,238
Calm down, everyone.
It's all right.

44
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,571
Fine. Okay.

45
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,387
Danielle?

46
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,485
Danielle?

47
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,959
What are you doing here?

48
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,762
The others are coming.

49
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,253
Our ship went aground

50
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,624
on this island 16 years ago.

51
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,595
There were six of us.

52
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,430
My team. Six.

53
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,901
By that time,

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,234
I was already
seven months pregnant.

55
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,098
I delivered the infant myself.

56
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,709
The baby and I were together
for only one week,

57
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,478
when I saw black smoke.

58
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,948
A pillar of black smoke
five kilometers inland.

59
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,089
That night, they came.

60
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,900
They came and took her.

61
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,601
Alex.

62
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,231
They took my baby.

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,046
And now they're coming again.

64
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,810
They're coming for all of you.

65
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,683
- Who's coming?
- The others.

66
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,847
You have only three choices.

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,954
Run.

68
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,618
Hide.

69
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,963
Or die.

70
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,991
This woman
blew up her own shelter.

71
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,832
Now she talks about black smoke
and hearing whispers.

72
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,701
She's not playing with a full deck.

73
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,241
That doesn't mean
what she's saying isn't true.

74
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,106
You can focus on the "what ifs."

75
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:22,307
I'm sticking with the tangible,
and that's the launching of the raft.

76
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,714
- How's it going?
- I wanted to get off today,

77
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,379
but realistically, man,
after we get the rudder done,

78
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,514
we still gotta lay the rails
to get her down to the water.

79
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,391
Wouldn't it save time to lay
the rails while you finish the rudder?

80
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,395
Manpower shortage.

81
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,125
What do you need?
To lay the rails and move the boat?

82
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,657
Get it all done today?
Pretty much everybody.

83
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,936
All right, give me 20 minutes.

84
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,606
Grab as many palm tree logs
as you can find,

85
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,942
the longer the better,
over to the raft area.

86
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,244
- Michael knows what to do.
- See ya then.

87
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,546
You need to
get 'em in there tight,

88
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,746
and leverage
to get 'em on the rails.

89
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,847
Yeah, that's good.

90
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,255
Good. That's good.

91
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,689
Okay, that's good, man.

92
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,789
Just get it under there, okay?
Okay.

93
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,891
- You all right?
- Yep.

94
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,435
So listen, on my count,

95
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,269
I'll do, "one, two, three, lift,"
and then push, okay?

96
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,673
Got it? Okay, come on.

97
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,646
Once it's down to the water line,
we'll drop it and load it up.

98
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,012
All right. Ready?

99
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,247
One.

100
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,916
Two.

101
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,652
Three. Lift!

102
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,168
Push!

103
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,565
Push! Come on, guys.

104
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,940
Push. Push!

105
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,343
Use your levers.
Use the levers.

106
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,953
Yeah. Good, good.

107
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,548
One, two, three, lift.

108
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,616
Hey, keep it straight.

109
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,903
Oh, no! Come on!
I can't believe this.

110
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,029
Can't believe it.

111
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,097
- What are you looking at me for?
- You missed the lever!

112
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,906
- You couldn't keep the raft straight!
- I couldn't keep it straight?

113
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,913
Dad! Look.

114
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,134
How many of them are there?
- I told you all I know.

115
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,506
There has to be more to tell.
How did you know?

116
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,374
You have a bigger problem.

117
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,347
I can vanish into the jungle,
but I'm just one person.

118
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,179
You have 40 people.

119
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,550
Where will you hide them?

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,425
Dude. Whoa.

121
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,269
What is this?

122
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,703
We hoped you could tell us.

123
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,216
- I've never seen anything like it.
- Uh, question.

124
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,616
How do you know we can
all, like, fit in there?

125
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,748
No handle outside, must be another
way in. Another entrance means space.

126
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,691
This is a mistake.
We don't know about these others.

127
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,527
We're reacting with no information,
no intelligence. This might be theirs.

128
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,727
Black smoke doesn't mean...

129
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,133
- It means they're coming.
- Yeah, we got that.

130
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,764
You booby-trapped your shelter
with explosives. Have any more?

131
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,937
Dynamite. At the Black Rock.

132
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,374
In the Dark Territory.

133
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,542
That's three reasons
to go right there.

134
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,280
If we're to make it back by sunset,

135
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,413
we have to leave
within the hour.

136
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,569
Tequila and tonic
with a wedge of lemon.

137
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,719
Why were you yelling?

138
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,982
The girl at the check-in counter.

139
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,290
You were yelling at her.

140
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,028
I'm sorry, uh, do I know you?

141
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,592
I'm on your flight. LA.

142
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,903
So, your dad died, huh?

143
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,072
I thought you didn't hear
what I was yelling about.

144
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,139
I was being polite.

145
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,616
Yeah, my dad died.

146
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,580
How?

147
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,825
A heart attack.

148
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,161
Not a drinker, huh?

149
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,232
No, not really.

150
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,999
No ring 'cause you're single
or because you don't like wearing one?

151
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,503
You asking me if I'm married?

152
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,780
Are you married?

153
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,649
No, not anymore.

154
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,355
Can we get another
tequila and tonic, please?

155
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,322
I didn't think you were listening.

156
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,929
- So, what's your name?
- Ana-Lucia.

157
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,269
So, tell me, Ana-Lucia,

158
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,468
why are you drinking
tequila and tonics

159
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:29,105
- At ten to noon?
- I hate flying.

160
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,412
And they stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane

161
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,454
where the wheels come down
right under your damn feet.

162
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,287
So, where are you sitting?

163
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,925
23 B.

164
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,555
42 F. Wanna trade?

165
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,431
Hey. Yeah, I'm in Sydney.
Hold on.

166
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:01,071
- Sorry...
- Uh, Jack.

167
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,809
Jack. I gotta talk.

168
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,478
Um... we'll have the next drink
on the plane, okay?

169
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:11,319
- 42 F.
- 42 F. Right.

170
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,759
And, Jack?

171
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,853
The worst part's over.

172
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,173
They stuck me all the way
in the back of the plane.

173
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,641
Look, I know you're all scared.

174
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,974
And I know that everybody
has a lot of questions.

175
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,874
All I can tell you right now
is that we do have a plan.

176
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,147
We've got to go into
the jungle for supplies.

177
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,314
We'll be back in a few hours.

178
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,381
In the meantime,
do everything you can

179
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,517
to help Michael get that raft
on the water.

180
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,688
And after that, go to the caves.

181
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,894
We'll be back
as soon as we can. I promise.

182
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,765
Hey, nice speech.

183
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,273
Plan's a little flawed,
but nobody's perfect.

184
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,502
- My plan?
- Your plan. Go in the jungle,

185
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,909
and get dynamite
and blow open a hatch,

186
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,844
and then hide everyone inside.

187
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,315
You wanna keep a secret,
don't tell the fat guy.

188
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,685
What do you want, Arzt?

189
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,383
God knows how long
that dynamite has been out there.

190
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,426
And from what I can tell,
Madame Nutso

191
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,326
doesn't seem too concerned
with how to handle it.

192
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:28,890
So unless you want to blow up,
I'm coming with you.

193
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,595
Okay.
Grab some water bottles.

194
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,401
We're leaving in a half an hour.

195
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,443
We can salvage the cables, but we
need new bamboo for the mast.

196
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:47,010
We need to fix the rudder
before we start to think about that.

197
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,888
- You need help?
- Let's get this done first.

198
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:54,687
Hey, this wasn't my fault.
So put me to work.

199
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,228
No offense.
We just work faster this way, okay?

200
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,033
All right! What do you think
I'm doing over here?

201
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,234
You remember me?

202
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,371
Three nights ago.

203
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,876
You were hauled in here
thrashing and fighting.

204
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,870
As you were being escorted by,
you kicked my desk.

205
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,376
And you broke my mug.

206
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:21,009
Nice kids.

207
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,519
Sadly for you,

208
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,580
breaking my mug was not the most
significant mistake you made.

209
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,320
Come on, doctor.
I got into a bar fight.

210
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,589
Ain't that a badge
of honor in this country?

211
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,893
You know who you
head-butted in that bar?

212
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,661
You head-butted
the Honorable Warren Truss...

213
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,397
...Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Forestry.

214
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,872
- The most important...
- He head-butted me.

215
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,376
We have witnesses.
He did no such thing.

216
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,571
'Course.

217
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,941
You think this is funny, James?

218
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,885
"James Ford.
Assault, wire fraud,

219
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,892
identity theft, bank fraud,
telemarketing fraud..."

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,487
- This going someplace?
- You're a blight, a stain, scavenger.

221
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,895
You're a con man preying
on the weak and needy.

222
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,958
Tell me something, James,
how do you live with yourself?

223
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,663
- I do just fine.
- Do you?

224
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,132
You're not even worth
the cost to incarcerate you.

225
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:23,003
Which is why you're being deported.

226
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,574
Your plane leaves this afternoon.
And, James,

227
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,519
you're banned from ever
setting foot in Australia again.

228
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:33,285
Don't you worry.
I ain't ever coming back here.

229
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,088
Best not, mate.

230
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,144
A lumberjack.

231
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,341
'Scuse me?

232
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,476
I never asked what you did
back in the real world.

233
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,817
So I'm taking a wild guess.
Lumberjack.

234
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,881
Something I can help you with, doc?
'Cause I got work to do.

235
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,154
I got something for you.

236
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,757
You're the only one on the raft
who knows how to use one.

237
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,530
- What do I need a gun for?
- Just in case.

238
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,630
You think we're gonna
run outta food and water?

239
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,573
I put the kid out of his misery?

240
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,042
Just in case.

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,177
What're you doing with the rest?

242
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,114
Giving 'em to Sayid.

243
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,979
Going into the jungle
after the boomsticks, huh?

244
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,518
Yeah.

245
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,820
Time you get back,
we'll be in the water.

246
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,760
Guess this is pretty much
goodbye then.

247
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,858
Yeah, I guess it is.

248
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,666
Good luck, Sawyer.

249
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:58,965
Jack.

250
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,852
About a week before
we all got on the plane,

251
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,222
I got to talking to this man
in a bar in Sydney.

252
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,023
He was an American too.
A doctor.

253
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,962
I've been on some benders
in my time,

254
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,798
but this guy was going
for an all-time record.

255
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,899
So it turns out
this guy has a son.

256
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,306
Son's a doctor too.

257
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,774
They'd had some kinda
big-time falling out.

258
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,645
The guy knew it was his fault...
even though his son

259
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,346
was back in the States
thinking the same damn thing.

260
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,458
See, kids are like dogs.

261
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,924
You knock 'em around enough,

262
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,762
they'll think they did
something to deserve it.

263
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,667
Anyway...

264
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,476
...there's a pay phone in this bar,

265
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,205
and this guy...

266
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,213
...Christian...

267
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,153
...tells me he wishes
he had the stones

268
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,688
to pick up the phone
and call his kid.

269
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,651
Tell him he's sorry.

270
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:25,555
That he's a better doctor
than he'll ever be.

271
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,099
He's proud.

272
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,572
And he loves him.

273
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,238
I had to take off...

274
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,817
...but something tells me
he never made that call.

275
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,727
Small world, huh?

276
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,392
Yeah.

277
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,833
Good luck, Jack.

278
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:32,296
- You're gonna be armed?
- Yes, sir, an ankle holster.

279
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,992
Stow this in the crew luggage
compartment in front.

280
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,398
No problemo.

281
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,164
Why do you need five guns?

282
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,569
Gee, you wanna tell him, Kate?

283
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,304
Why do I need five guns?

284
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,145
She's shy.

285
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,579
What's this, then?

286
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,984
That's a good story.
You wanna tell it?

287
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,920
Huh, Kate?

288
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:04,794
This belonged to her
childhood sweetheart,

289
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,060
who she got killed
a couple of years ago

290
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,361
when she was on the run.

291
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,995
Poor guy. Had a wife.
Two-year-old kid.

292
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,096
What was his name?

293
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,573
Somewhere during the three years
I was chasing her,

294
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:24,275
she starts calling me
at my house,

295
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,546
and whining on about
her mitigating circumstances.

296
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,953
But what she's really doing...
is taunting me.

297
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,018
So I tell her that I've got

298
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,824
what's-his-name's
little toy airplane

299
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,765
in a safe deposit box
in New Mexico.

300
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,359
So she somehow
figures out which bank,

301
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,166
which safe deposit box.

302
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,970
She seduces some idiot
to rob the damn bank,

303
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,706
then puts a bullet in her new friend
because she's done using him.

304
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,509
But she leaves all the money.
She just takes the plane.

305
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,050
Because that's the one thing
in the whole world

306
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,649
that Kate does care about.

307
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,520
She has no attachments.

308
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,496
And I think she's
telling herself she needs it

309
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,733
to atone for killing her boyfriend,
what's-his-name.

310
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:25,973
Come on.
What was his name?

311
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,033
Tom!

312
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,636
It was Tom, you son of a bitch!

313
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,379
And that is why I need five guns.

314
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,000
You're heading out?

315
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,599
Yeah.

316
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,840
I was thinking
that I might go with you...

317
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,347
...for old time's sake.

318
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,255
I wanna help.

319
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,023
You won't be here
for the raft launching.

320
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:20,428
Yeah, well, I'm not
very good at goodbyes.

321
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,331
Grab your stuff.

322
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,213
- Thanks, man.
- Keep it safe.

323
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,580
Locke, you have a message?
It's going on the raft.

324
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,814
You know, "Dear Mom,
everything's fine. I'm on the island.

325
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:46,551
Unless the Black Smoke People
turn up. Love..." Your name here.

326
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,321
When they get rescued,
they can contact your family.

327
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,363
Message in a bottle.
That's sweet.

328
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,694
- You're ready?
- Here you go.

329
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,099
Okay.

330
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,566
- Don't look at it.
- Got it.

331
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,376
Dude.

332
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,571
Do not look at it.

333
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,180
- Arzt! You want paper?
- I gave at the office.

334
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,921
- Take care.
- Good luck, dude.

335
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,117
- Keep dry, kiddo.
- I will.

336
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,525
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

337
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,727
- See you soon.
- Yes, you will.

338
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,663
- Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

339
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,398
- You look after your dad, okay?
- I will.

340
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,463
All right.

341
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,307
Jin.

342
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,478
Good luck.

343
00:24:56,261 --> 00:25:00,357
- Hey, have you seen Sawyer?
- No.

344
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,226
All right, let's go!

345
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,160
Take care, okay?

346
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,023
Where'd you get the scratches?

347
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,822
A bush.

348
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,693
Mean bush.

349
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,569
We'd better keep moving.

350
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,479
- Let me ask you something, Arnzt.
- Arzt.

351
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,509
- Arnzt.
- Not Arnzt. Arzt. A-R-Z-T.

352
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,580
Sorry, man,
name's hard to pronounce.

353
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:35,649
I know a bunch of ninth graders
who pronounce it just fine.

354
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,854
How about I call you
by your first name?

355
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,863
- How about you don't.
- Why not?

356
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,195
I remember it
from the plane's manifest.

357
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,532
- Leslie's a bitching name.
- "Arnzt" is fine.

358
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,667
<i>Le Territoire fonce. </i>

359
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,769
The Dark Territory.

360
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:34,981
The Black Rock is not far.

361
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:38,454
This is where it all began,
when my team got infected,

362
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,956
when Montand lost his arm.

363
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,661
We must move quickly.

364
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,729
You know what?
I'm going back.

365
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,292
Hey, I thought
you wanted to help.

366
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,598
Yeah, I wanted to help,

367
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,106
before Montand
lost his frigging arm.

368
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,199
What about the dynamite?

369
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,142
Just be very careful with it.

370
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,025
No! This one goes there,
that one goes there.

371
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,821
Okay, okay.

372
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,418
Hey, chief!

373
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,056
Cut and measured to length.

374
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:26,195
- Perfect mast.
- Thanks.

375
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,299
Well, all right.

376
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,672
Are we gonna get off this rock
or just stand around talking about it?

377
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:02,531
Did you hear that?

378
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,754
Run! Run! Run!

379
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,057
Run!

380
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,698
- What are you...?
- Just be still.

381
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,578
Ah! Ah! Ah!

382
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,646
Here! In here.

383
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,526
Dude, we gotta book.

384
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,793
Wait.

385
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,792
It's headed the other way.

386
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,277
We're safe now.

387
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,119
- What was that thing?
- It's a security system.

388
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,455
Security system?
What does that mean?

389
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,393
Its purpose is that
of any security system's:

390
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,259
To protect something.

391
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,798
Protect what?

392
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,934
The island.

393
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,981
Uh, where's Arnzt?

394
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,780
That's Arzt, you idiot.

395
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,378
Dude, I thought you were dead.

396
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,720
Can we just please go
get the dynamite? Please?

397
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,466
Why are you folding clothes?

398
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,065
Because I'm anal.

399
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,012
Is there something you want?

400
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,782
I think you should take Vincent.

401
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,549
Are you serious?

402
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,094
He'll take care of you.

403
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,198
What makes you think I need
a dog to take care of me?

404
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,866
Vincent took care of me
when my mom died.

405
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,044
And nobody would talk to me.

406
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,174
They pretended
like nothing happened.

407
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,151
So I talked to Vincent.

408
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,380
He's a good listener.

409
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,384
You could talk to him
about Boone if you want.

410
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,895
All right.

411
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,108
But only until
you get us rescued, okay?

412
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,954
<i>Flight 338 to Fiji will be delayed. </i>

413
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,621
<i>Please check the board
for flight details. </i>

414
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,595
Excuse me. Would you mind
watching my bag for a moment?

415
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,896
I'll be right back.

416
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,432
- Sure. Whatever.
- Thank you.

417
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,639
Couldn't get us into first class.

418
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,974
Why not?

419
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,776
Um, maybe you shouldn't have
yelled at the gate agent.

420
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,079
What, you're on his side now?

421
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,483
One day you'll appreciate
everything I do for you.

422
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah, I can't wait for that day.

423
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,854
- Try again with the gate agent.
- Would you let it go?

424
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,987
Excuse me for not being
pathetic enough

425
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:21,930
to want to sit next to a crying baby
for the next 15 hours.

426
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,130
- Oh, God, you can be a bitch.
- Oh, you wanna play?

427
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:29,139
- I'll get you thrown off this flight.
- How you gonna do that?

428
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:31,141
I can do what I want.
I can tell them...

429
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,201
Tell them what?
Who's gonna believe you?

430
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,271
- You're not even capable of...
- You have no idea what I am capable of.

431
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,977
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, ma'am.

432
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:45,113
Some Arab guy left his bags in the
chairs downstairs and walked away.

433
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:50,183
- Can you describe him, please?
- Um... Arab.

434
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,024
He went towards the shops.

435
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,656
We've got a report
of suspicious activity...

436
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,032
How's that?

437
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,639
I salvaged a few things for you
from the Beechcraft.

438
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,906
This is the plane's radar emitter.

439
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,847
It needs to be mounted
on the mast or the top of the cabin.

440
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,247
I'll do it.

441
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:18,545
Michael, to conserve power,
turn it on only once every hour or so.

442
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,114
It will show you any ships
within the horizon line,

443
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,422
approximately 25 miles.

444
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,826
The same with the radio transmitter.

445
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,333
This was in the plane's toolbox.
There's only one flare.

446
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:32,902
Choose wisely when you use it.

447
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,818
- Why are we stopping?
- Because we're here.

448
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,623
This is the Black Rock.

449
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,940
<i>This is the first
pre-boarding call for flight 2599... </i>

450
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,804
You catch me doing anything
like that for you, shoot me.

451
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,935
Don't knock it. Their divorce rate's
20 times lower than ours.

452
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,541
- Oh!
- Ah!

453
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:07,029
<i>My God, it's Memoirs of a Geisha
come to life.</i>

454
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,156
Hey, volume.

455
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,128
Relax. They don't speak English.

456
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,705
Star... Starboard.

457
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,335
Starboard.

458
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,382
- Go, go, go, go!
- Bye, Vincent!

459
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,886
Bye, Vincent!

460
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,018
That's it.

461
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,314
Stay, Vincent!

462
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,617
Go back, Vincent!

463
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:04,923
Vincent, go back!

464
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,259
Go back!

465
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,453
What'd I tell ya, huh?

466
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,326
- What'd I tell ya, huh?
- We did it!

467
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,267
You! Whoo!
