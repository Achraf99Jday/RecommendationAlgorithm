1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,225
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:04,596
Has anyone seen Ethan?

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,138
He went to get some wood,
on the path to the beach.

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,038
- Charlie?
- He went after Claire.

5
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,703
Footprints, three distinct sets
all over the place.

6
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:13,939
Looks like there might
have been a struggle.

7
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,313
I think they've been taken.
We need to organize a search party.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,442
Can I help?

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,383
Could use a hand,
if you're up for it.

10
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,479
This is a deserted island.
How are you gonna find them?

11
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,687
- What do you do in the real world?
- I was a...

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,959
...regional collections supervisor
for a box company.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,125
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,168
- You should head back.
- What about you?

15
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,227
- I can take care of myself.
- No.

16
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,330
- I admire your courage, but you...
- I'm not heading back.

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,601
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

18
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,737
You and Locke
leaving before sunrise

19
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,873
and coming back after dark
for four days.

20
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,746
What are you doing out there?

21
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,944
- Looking for Claire.
- I thought there was no trail,

22
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,387
no one knew where to look.

23
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,392
It's gonna start raining
in one minute.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,951
- One minute?
- Give or take a few seconds.

25
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,587
They aren't back yet.

26
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,928
I'm sure they just
made camp for the night.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,096
If there's anyone on this island
your brother's safe with, it's Locke.

28
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,941
They teach you how to predict
the weather at a box company?

29
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,063
I brought you a present

30
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,299
for helping me
with the translations.

31
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,836
I didn't have a chance
to get it gift wrapped, so...

32
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,241
Oh...

33
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,753
I found these in the wreckage,
and I have no use for them personally.

34
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,449
They're actually my size.

35
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,653
Well, half a size off, but I swear,
this place is making my feet swell.

36
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,594
Another mysterious force
on the island revealed.

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,492
Yo, Boone.

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,470
- Question for you, dude.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,973
You and Locke are hunting boar
every day, right?

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,770
- What about it?
- It's cool, except

41
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,175
how come you're not
coming back with any?

42
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,340
We haven't had fresh pork
on our plate in about a week.

43
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,940
It's not like they're
domesticated animals.

44
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,452
- Maybe you aren't trying hard?
- We're hunting.

45
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,048
I hope so, 'cause
people need food, man.

46
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,951
Solid food.

47
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,517
This isn't a game, man.

48
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,865
I can't believe you
ran down that last ball.

49
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,373
- Then you hit it for a winner.
- Lucky shot.

50
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,376
Yeah, I wish it was luck.

51
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,742
Is that my phone?

52
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,972
Yeah, hello.

53
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,482
<i> Boone, it's me. </i>

54
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,883
<i>- Shannon?
- Yeah. </i>

55
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,712
What's the matter?

56
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,020
<i>- Things aren't so good. 
- Where are you?</i>

57
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
<i>Get out of here! 
Get the hell away from me! </i>

58
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,022
<i>- Shannon?
- Stay out of here! </i>

59
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,393
<i>Get away from me! </i>

60
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,227
<i>- What's going on?
- I can't talk. </i>

61
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,767
All right, hang on.

62
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,031
Just tell me where you are.
I'll come get you.

63
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,901
<i>- Sydney. 
- Sydney.</i>

64
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,497
<i>Australia. </i>

65
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,075
Stay away from my sister.

66
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,086
For a moment, you seemed
to be giving me an order.

67
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,146
- It's just a friendly suggestion.
- A suggestion.

68
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,385
Yes, and if I were you, I'd listen.

69
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,620
What if I don't?

70
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,887
Boone!

71
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,264
I found some fresh tracks
down by the stream.

72
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,073
- I'll see you later.
- You know where to find me.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,248
Put aside your differences
with Sayid.

74
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,910
He's hitting on Shannon.

75
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,286
He's very competent.
We don't want to make an enemy of him.

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,519
We're gonna want him on our side.

77
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,026
People are talking
about what we're doing,

78
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,122
since we never
come back with anything.

79
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,894
You mean boar.

80
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,527
- Yeah.
- There's plenty of fruit and fish.

81
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,372
What we're doing here
is far more important.

82
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,021
Right now,
this is our priority.

83
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,344
So, Jack...

84
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,775
So, Hurley.

85
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,116
There's something kind of important

86
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,679
I've been wanting to ask you about.

87
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,418
Um...

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,156
Anything I tell you is, uh,

89
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,256
doctor-patient confidential, right?

90
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,097
Yeah.

91
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,230
The thing is,
I haven't been feeling so great.

92
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,103
What's the matter?

93
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,269
Well, it's kinda like, uh,
my stomach.

94
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,973
I've been having some, um...

95
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,981
...major digestive issues.

96
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,540
- What have you been eating?
- The usual:

97
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,678
Bananas, papayas, mangoes,

98
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,052
guava, passion fruit,

99
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,320
coconut, some of those weird
star fruits from up on the hill.

100
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,588
Someone said they'd
be good for digestion.

101
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,993
Let me tell you, they lied.

102
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,327
It might help if you had
a little more protein.

103
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,129
What can I do? There's no boar.
No boar, no protein.

104
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,603
You can eat fish.
Jin's been catching a lot of 'em.

105
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,072
- That guy has it in for me.
- Come on...

106
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:18,338
I'm not kidding.
He offered me something to eat, like,

107
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,141
right after we, you know, got here.

108
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,445
- Um, that thing with the spikes.
- Sea urchin.

109
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,485
Yeah, when I turned him down,
it's like

110
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:30,215
I soiled his
family honor or something.

111
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,747
He hasn't looked me in the eye since.
The guy holds a serious grudge.

112
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,691
You're not eating those, are you?

113
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,257
Dude, these aren't for eating.

114
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,028
Excuse me.

115
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,431
I can see you there, you know.

116
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,568
I wasn't hiding.

117
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,977
I just didn't want
to disrupt you from doing...

118
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,610
...whatever it is you're doing.

119
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:35,354
- It's not like it's a secret.
- Hard to tell with you sometimes.

120
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,359
Ah! Gross, little,
grayish yellow things.

121
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,862
- Passion fruit seeds.
- What are they for?

122
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,459
I'll show you...
if you want to see.

123
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,299
Yeah.

124
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,398
Follow me.

125
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,008
Please tell me
you found a coffee bar.

126
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,380
Not quite.

127
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,453
- When did you do all this?
- I didn't.

128
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,758
It was all Sun.

129
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,493
I wandered into this place the other day
when I was picking fruit.

130
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,627
This is beautiful. It's great.

131
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,573
She planted some herbs
and some low-growing stuff here,

132
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,736
and then she started
a grove over there.

133
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,575
Smart.

134
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,139
With the boar running out, we're gonna
need as much food as we can get.

135
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,380
- Maybe it's not running out.
- What do you mean?

136
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,323
Maybe Locke's just decided
not to catch it for us anymore.

137
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,616
- Why would he do that?
- A lot of mouths to feed.

138
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,528
If the boar's thinning out, why should
he feed everyone else at his expense?

139
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,600
That glass isn't breaking,
and the door is sealed shut.

140
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,435
I think it's cement.

141
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,001
- What is that?
- Hmm?

142
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,069
The stuff in the bowl,
what is that?

143
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,637
It's for later.

144
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,551
Not to be too difficult,

145
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,146
but we've been coming here for two days,
just staring at this thing.

146
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,659
I'm not really sure what
we're supposed to be doing.

147
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,455
Lodovico Buonarroti.

148
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,998
Michelangelo's father,

149
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,624
he was a wealthy man.

150
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,898
Had no understanding
of the divinity in his son,

151
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,939
so he beat him.

152
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,566
No child of his was gonna
use his hands for a living.

153
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,169
So Michelangelo learned
not to use his hands.

154
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,512
Years later, a visiting prince
came into Michelangelo's studio

155
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:49,886
and found the master staring at
a single 18-foot block of marble.

156
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:53,187
He knew the rumors were true,
Michelangelo had come in every day

157
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,625
for the past four months,

158
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,356
stared at the marble

159
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,988
and gone home for supper.

160
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,795
So the prince asked the obvious:
"What are you doing?"

161
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,928
And Michelangelo turned around
and looked at him and whispered...

162
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,307
"I'm working."

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,372
Three years later, that block of marble
was the statue of David.

164
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,118
We're not gonna stare at this thing
for four months, are we?

165
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,453
How we gonna open it?

166
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,860
That's what we have to figure out.
That's why we're sitting here.

167
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,024
I mean, how do you open a...

168
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,799
...hatch that has no handle,
no latch...

169
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,443
...no discernible way
of opening it?

170
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,447
Yeah?

171
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,648
- I'm looking for Shannon.
- Who are you?

172
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,215
I'm her brother.

173
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,460
- Boone?
- What's going on?

174
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,003
What are you doing here?

175
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,132
Fifteen hours. I just spent
15 hours on a plane.

176
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,733
"I'm happy to see you."
That might work.

177
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,041
Listen, this isn't really
the best time.

178
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:24,173
Bryan and I were on our way out
to meet some friends.

179
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,808
Give me a call tomorrow.

180
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,985
Please.

181
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,589
Okay.

182
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,358
Enjoy your friends.

183
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,608
Jin! Yo, Jin!

184
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,840
<i>Uh, alto. </i>

185
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,682
I know you don't like me
'cause of the sea urchin thing.

186
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,312
That's okay, 'cause I'm not
asking for any favors.

187
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,357
Just let me know
where you get the fish.

188
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,024
Fish.

189
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,995
Point me in the right direction.

190
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,931
I'll take care of my own
business with my own tools.

191
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,967
You just said
something mean, didn't you?

192
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,142
You know, we're gonna
have to tell 'em.

193
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,482
- Tell them what?
- What we found.

194
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,117
They're not gonna keep believing
that we're hunting.

195
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,455
They're not ready.
They won't understand it.

196
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,553
- I don't think I understand it.
- That's the problem.

197
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,463
Look, at least...
I gotta tell Shannon.

198
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,662
- Why?
- 'Cause she's my sister.

199
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,135
Why do you care
about her so much?

200
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,104
You don't know her, man.

201
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,574
She's smart and she's special
in a lot of ways.

202
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,900
Fair enough.

203
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,241
She's been asking me about this.
I can't keep lying to her.

204
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,211
You can't keep lying to her,

205
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,755
or you can't stand the way
she makes you feel

206
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,984
because you're lying to her?

207
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,389
Both. Whatever.

208
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,521
Look, she can keep a secret.

209
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,564
- You're sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

210
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,604
I mean, are you sure
you want to do this?

211
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,936
I gotta get her off my back.
She keeps asking me about this,

212
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,067
about you, about the whole thing.

213
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,271
Are you sure you've thought
through the ramifications?

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,211
Yes.

215
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,978
So be it.

216
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,542
Locke...

217
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,215
What is this?

218
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,583
Do you hear me?

219
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,421
- Untie me right now.
- Or what?

220
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:26,053
I swear I won't tell anyone about
the hatch thing, okay? I promise.

221
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:30,090
I'm doing this because it's time
for you to let go of some things,

222
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,898
because it's what's best for you.

223
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,600
And I promise, you're gonna
thank me for this later.

224
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:40,509
Hey, I don't think
this is best for me.

225
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,841
What is that?

226
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,382
An untreated wound out here,

227
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,583
it's gonna get infected.

228
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,283
You're not gonna leave me here.

229
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,519
Whether you stay is up to you.

230
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,220
The camp is four miles due west.

231
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,694
Which way is west?

232
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,938
You'll be able to cut yourself free
once you have the proper motivation.

233
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,279
Locke!

234
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,404
Help!

235
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,309
Help!

236
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,247
I'm sorry, Mr. Carlisle,
but I'm afraid I can't help you.

237
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,547
We'll need a little more to go on.

238
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,053
I don't understand this.
I'm reporting a crime.

239
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,455
Look, this is a cycle
with her, okay?

240
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,959
My sister is attracted
to the wrong kind of guy.

241
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
It was his bottle.
I just gave it back to him.

242
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,456
Hey, yo, croc hunter!

243
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,093
How come nobody wants to hear
my side of the story?

244
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,837
Now, if that were her mate,
see, then I could help you.

245
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,204
Let's finish taking down
your information.

246
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,038
You were saying she's your sister.

247
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,136
Then why is her name Rutherford
and yours Carlisle?

248
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,805
- Is she married?
- She was.

249
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,442
She's not married anymore.
That has nothing to do with this.

250
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,648
Rutherford is her father's name.

251
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,815
Our parents married
when I was 10, she was 8.

252
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,620
- She's your stepsister.
- That's right.

253
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,127
No blood relation.

254
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,295
Maybe you've heard
of my mother, Sabrina Carlisle.

255
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,861
She owns the largest wedding
business in the U.S.

256
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,669
I'm the C.O.O. of the
wedding clothing subsidiary.

257
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,074
Would you like to buy
my wife's wedding dress?

258
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,611
It cost $2,000 new.
It's only been worn once.

259
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,843
I just want someone to go pay
this guy a visit, that's all.

260
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,215
In the absence of physical evidence
or a direct complaint from...

261
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,313
- Shannon.
...Shannon...

262
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,517
We can't barge
into people's apartments.

263
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,925
Sadly, we're the police,
not the dating police.

264
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,660
- Bryan, we need to talk.
- Huh?

265
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,931
I'm not gonna waste
your time or mine.

266
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,405
I want you to break up
with my sister.

267
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,433
- What?
- I want you to end it today. Right now.

268
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,106
- Bugger off, mate.
- You don't understand.

269
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,672
You'll be the third guy
I've paid to leave.

270
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,413
Go to her house, pack your stuff
and never have contact with her again.

271
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,014
- Understood?
- So you flew over here to bribe me?

272
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,355
I'm going to give you
25,000 U.S. dollars.

273
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,424
- I love her.
- How much?

274
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,691
My love for her?

275
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,766
It's worth closer to $50,000.

276
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,002
Can you believe we've been here
for over three weeks?

277
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,274
I was on my way to Bali.

278
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,282
I travel a lot.

279
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,643
I was looking forward
to exploring the island.

280
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,950
Somehow I ended up
on a flight to LA instead.

281
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,956
I guess that falls under the category
"Be careful what you wish for."

282
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,964
You understood me.

283
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,436
You did, didn't you?
You just understood what I said.

284
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,639
You speak English?

285
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:39,973
Please,

286
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,279
don't tell anyone.

287
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,297
Damn it!

288
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,580
You know what? Fine.

289
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,346
You win, okay? You happy now?

290
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,684
Keep your damn fish.
I'm outta here.

291
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,486
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

292
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,153
I stepped on a friggin' urchin!

293
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,093
You understand me?

294
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:29,929
You understand infection?
Gangrene? Amputation?

295
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,800
Ow! My foot!

296
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,574
Oh. Ow! Oh, you gotta
do something for me.

297
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,117
You're gonna have
to pee on my foot.

298
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,848
It'll stop the venom.
I saw it on TV.

299
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,549
Just do it! Ow!

300
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,956
No, just pee on it, man!
You need to pee...

301
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,892
Pee on it.

302
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,725
Pee on my foot. I'll lose...

303
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,731
I'll lose my foot if you don't.

304
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,326
Just pee on it!

305
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,694
No!

306
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,019
- Hi.
- I didn't hear you.

307
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:32,291
Sorry. I'm sneakier
than I give myself credit for.

308
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,930
- What are you doing out here?
- We were hunting.

309
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,164
Boone thought
I should take the afternoon off.

310
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,830
Boone is hunting?

311
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,340
Boy's eager to learn.

312
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,437
- You think he'll catch anything?
- Nope.

313
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,018
What are you doing out here, Sayid?

314
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,747
Orienteering.

315
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,449
I'm trying to make something
of Rousseau's maps...

316
00:20:58,523 --> 00:20:59,990
There's nothing to make.

317
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,452
Exactly.

318
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:05,155
Well, you made a compass.
I haven't seen one of those

319
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,290
since I was a Webelos.

320
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,130
What's a Webelos?

321
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,363
Halfway between
a Cub Scout and a Boy Scout.

322
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,735
And what does a Webelos do?

323
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,541
Gets badges mostly.

324
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,339
Ties knots, identifies birds.

325
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,843
I wasn't the most popular kid.

326
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,423
I'll leave you to it.

327
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,621
Here.

328
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,993
Maybe this will help your cause.

329
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,405
- Don't you need this?
- Not anymore.

330
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,090
Somebody, help me!

331
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,063
- Who's that?
- Boone?

332
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,862
Shannon!

333
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,527
- I'm tied up!
- What?

334
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,768
Can you get over here?

335
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,829
I'm tied up too!

336
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,139
Hold on. I'm coming!

337
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,449
Boone!
It's getting closer!

338
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,989
Somebody, help me!

339
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,753
Boone?

340
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,831
Please, Boone!

341
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,674
Oh!

342
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,905
Boone!

343
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,919
- Boone!
- Shannon!

344
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,594
- Help me! Hurry!
- I'm trying.

345
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,755
Please.

346
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,126
Please hurry!

347
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,035
Go!

348
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,541
Come on!

349
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,579
- Run!
- No! In here.

350
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,178
No!

351
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,530
Let me ask you something.

352
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,124
Which way do you think north is?

353
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,500
- Sorry?
- North. Which way is it?

354
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,165
Uh...

355
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,901
Okay.

356
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,567
The sun's gonna set there,

357
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,079
so that makes that west.

358
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,978
That'd be north.

359
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,145
Yeah.

360
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,052
Correct.
That's where north should be.

361
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,623
Yet that is north.

362
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,018
I'm not...

363
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,692
A magnetic anomaly might explain
a variance of two or three degrees,

364
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,962
but not this.

365
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:08,995
- What are you saying?
- This compass is obviously defective.

366
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,641
Where'd you get it?

367
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,508
Locke gave it to me this afternoon.

368
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,040
Locke.

369
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,180
Where'd you see Locke?

370
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,710
About a mile east of here,
walking through the jungle.

371
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,415
At least I think it's east.

372
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,631
What did you do to him?

373
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,763
- What did I do to who?
- Locke.

374
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,670
What did you do to piss him off?

375
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,641
I didn't do anything to him.

376
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,543
What, he just did it
because he was bored?

377
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,673
- Look, I know you guys are...
- Let's go back to camp.

378
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,525
- You were supposed to come later.
- Any bags?

379
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,527
- Anything you want?
- Come back.

380
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,620
No, we're getting out
of this country.

381
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,859
Is there anything you want
to bring with you?

382
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,127
What's the matter?

383
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,262
Oh, look at this.

384
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,206
Let's go, please.

385
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,444
Come on.

386
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,411
We can go.

387
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,278
Hey, mate, you don't
get this yet, do you?

388
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,612
What's what.

389
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,055
You set me up.

390
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,597
This whole thing was a setup.

391
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,862
- She's getting what she's owed.
- What did you say?

392
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,167
She told me your mum screwed
Shannon over after her daddy died,

393
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,104
kept her father's money for herself.

394
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,938
Oh, sweet mum you got there.

395
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,340
This isn't the first time, is it?

396
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,351
- You've done this before, little bitch.
- That's enough.

397
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,512
Don't touch me,
you lowlife piece of...

398
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,024
Bryan, get off of him!

399
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,358
Get off of him! Get off!

400
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,088
Any ships?

401
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,051
Not yet.

402
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,595
But I'm... patient.

403
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,258
Mind if I join you?

404
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,730
Been a while since
you and I talked, John.

405
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,504
- Well, you're a busy man.
- So are you.

406
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,945
Where's Boone?

407
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,009
- I haven't seen him today.
- Yeah?

408
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,851
You two have been attached
at the hip all week.

409
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,359
Well, let me just check my hip.
Nope, no Boone.

410
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,658
How's the boar hunting going?

411
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,957
- Between you and me?
- Always.

412
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,070
I'm afraid they're beginning
to migrate outside our valley.

413
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,472
They're smart animals,
and smart animals adapt quickly

414
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:07,534
when a new predator's
introduced into their environment.

415
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,102
You mean us?

416
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,416
The most dangerous predator of all.

417
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,181
Does anybody else know?

418
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,487
Only Michael.

419
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,152
- Not your husband?
- Please...

420
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,528
Don't worry. I can keep a secret.

421
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,768
I took English lessons in Korea.

422
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,306
He doesn't know. It's...

423
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,534
...complicated.

424
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,702
- So why don't you tell him now?
- I can't.

425
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,767
Why?

426
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,982
Because I love him.

427
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,515
- I don't...
- Have you never lied

428
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,144
to a man you've loved?

429
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,393
You sure you don't speak English?

430
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,592
'Cause there's a rumor that you do.

431
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,027
Your wife's hot.

432
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,013
Oh, I get it.
This is some kind of payback

433
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,147
because I wouldn't eat
the urchin the other time?

434
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,124
I eat this, you give me a fish, right?

435
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,097
Okay, fine.

436
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,591
Over the lips, past the gums,

437
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,193
yadda, yadda...

438
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,128
Oh, God.

439
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,892
Cheers.

440
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,899
You need a hand?

441
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,631
Yeah. I'd love one.

442
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,438
I seen you around the caves lately.

443
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,238
I needed a change of scenery.

444
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,080
How are you doing, Charlie?

445
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,549
How am I doing?

446
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,450
With week two
of heroin withdrawal,

447
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,853
or with Claire being abducted
by the freak who tried to kill me?

448
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,917
I gave you the aspirin
for the withdrawal.

449
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,396
- What do you think his story is?
- Who?

450
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,630
Locke?

451
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,438
The guy's a freak of nature.

452
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:50,838
Highly disturbed.

453
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,877
He probably killed all his mates

454
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:55,469
the day his mom forgot to put
a cookie in his lunch.

455
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,844
That was my first
impression, anyway.

456
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,952
And then he saved my life.

457
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,146
So you trust him?

458
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,522
Trust him?

459
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,957
If there's one person
on this island

460
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,996
I would put my absolute faith in
to save us all,

461
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,724
it would be John Locke.

462
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:33,682
Come on, boy.
You want the ball?

463
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,813
Go get the ball.
Good boy.

464
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,255
You found your bag?

465
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,952
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah.

466
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,388
Be nice to get to use
your own toothbrush again.

467
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,258
- Got some papaya there?
- Yeah.

468
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,563
- Yippee.
- Hey, you mind if l, uh...

469
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,660
Oh, knock yourself out.

470
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,762
Want to wish something
on your enemy?

471
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,171
Hope they step on a sea urchin.

472
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,936
Oh, hey.

473
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,211
Thanks.

474
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,425
Has this already been cleaned?
Are you kidding?

475
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,444
They look happy.

476
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,505
Happy?

477
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,150
Put out your hand.

478
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,826
You'll like it, I swear.

479
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,962
Gross, little,
grayish yellow thingies?

480
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,029
No, these are slimy,
little, bluish black things.

481
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,366
Guava seeds.

482
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,003
What's a garden without guava?

483
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,115
- Are we going the right direction?
- If you don't want to follow, don't.

484
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,422
I wouldn't have to if you weren't
best friends with that nutcase.

485
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,190
You weren't hunting.
You were doing something else.

486
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,995
- Haven't we been over this?
- You're a horrible liar.

487
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,060
- We weren't doing anything.
- Why are you keeping secrets?

488
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,604
Do you know who "this guy" is?

489
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,872
He's the only one here that has
a clue to what's going on.

490
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:41,139
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means he's smart.

491
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,372
He tied us up, Boone.

492
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,940
Why?

493
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,721
We found something.

494
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:55,815
What?

495
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,694
While looking for Claire, we found
a piece of metal buried in the jungle.

496
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,495
We've been excavating.
That's what we've been doing.

497
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,505
- A piece of metal.
- A hatch buried in the dirt.

498
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,165
- Like a door?
- Yeah, that's what a hatch is.

499
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,113
Where does it go?

500
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,549
I don't know.

501
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,484
I told him I wanted to tell you.
That's when he did this.

502
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,787
Come on!

503
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,108
No! Shannon!

504
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,278
Shannon!

505
00:35:58,055 --> 00:35:59,386
Shannon!

506
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:14,128
What do you want?

507
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,236
Bryan took the money.

508
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,176
He's gone.

509
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:34,452
So the player got played.
That's poetic, don't you think?

510
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,755
I knew you'd bring the money.

511
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,022
- You are drunk.
- Do you wanna know why?

512
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,326
It doesn't matter.
You're going to tell me.

513
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,196
Because you're in love with me.

514
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,425
What?

515
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,199
You brought the money
because you're in love with me.

516
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,766
You show up here plastered...

517
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,202
- You've always been.
- You've always been self-centered,

518
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,509
but now you're delusional.

519
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,209
I've always known it.

520
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,508
You're sick.

521
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,819
No...

522
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,691
- Stop.
- It's okay.

523
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,751
Shannon...

524
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,471
It's okay.

525
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,867
Boone.

526
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,371
What?

527
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,234
When we get back to LA,

528
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,178
you should just
tell your mom that...

529
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,581
...you rescued me again,
just like you always do,

530
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,711
and then we'll just go back.

531
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
- To what?
- To what it was.

532
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,694
Like it's all up to you.

533
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,830
Get dressed.

534
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,061
Shannon!

535
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,789
No.

536
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,307
Shannon.

537
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,972
Shannon. Shannon.

538
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,909
Shannon?

539
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,514
Oh, Shannon.

540
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,716
It killed her!

541
00:39:57,228 --> 00:40:01,927
- You made it back.
- That thing killed my sister.

542
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,024
It's your fault.
You drug her out there.

543
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,864
- Your sister?
- Don't play dumb.

544
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,700
- Calm down.
- She died in my arms.

545
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,940
Why is there no blood on you?

546
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,776
What just happened
to me out there?

547
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,149
I don't know.

548
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,751
I don't know. You tell me.

549
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:33,228
- But your sister, Shannon...
- I could spend days...

550
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,300
Sorry to spoil it.

551
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,566
She... She was dead.

552
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,645
- Is that what it made you see?
- What made me see?

553
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,684
That stuff you put on my head.

554
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,414
- You drugged me?
- I gave you an experience

555
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,549
that I believed was vital
to your survival on this island.

556
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,115
It wasn't real?

557
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,253
It was only as real as you made it.

558
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,859
I saw her.

559
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,036
I saw her die.

560
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:17,229
How did you feel

561
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,367
when she died?

562
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,078
I felt... I felt...

563
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,243
I felt relieved.

564
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:33,390
I felt relieved.

565
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,721
Yes.

566
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,159
Time to let go.

567
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,179
Follow me.
