1
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,037
Hi.

2
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,908
I'm expecting a letter.
"Hold for guest arrival."

3
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,572
- Sure. What's your name?
- Joan Hart.

4
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,642
Ah, Joan Hart.

5
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,153
Platinum.

6
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,995
Platinum?

7
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,231
As in platinum record.

8
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,667
As in a million units sold.

9
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,103
Now, Drive Shaft's albums must've...

10
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,110
...spiked when everybody
found out that I died

11
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,976
in some catastrophic
plane disaster.

12
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,413
But when I come back?

13
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,818
Alive!

14
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,648
It's gonna be insane.

15
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,490
So you think the raft's gonna work?

16
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,458
Of course. Look at that thing.

17
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,326
It's not a raft.
They built a sodding boat.

18
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:21,527
When they get picked up,
the helicopters will come,

19
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,501
making us ridiculously

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,334
and eternally famous.

21
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,232
What's the matter?

22
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,140
Don't you want to be famous?

23
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,179
...what I think. But the fact is...

24
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,182
What do you think's
going on over there?

25
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,122
Sure. You can absolutely wait
a few weeks before you launch.

26
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,453
I was just assuming you
didn't want to die.

27
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:52,027
So, uh, when's the next time
we can launch?

28
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:56,262
- Three... maybe four months.
- Come on!

29
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,271
Even a weatherman on TV
don't know what's gonna happen.

30
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,239
Why are we listening to Arzt?

31
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,333
Because I'm a doctor
and you're a hillbilly.

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,742
You're a damn
high school science teacher.

33
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,839
Hey, Sawyer,
let's just let the man talk.

34
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,747
It's been raining every afternoon.

35
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,310
That means that we are on
the cusp of monsoon season.

36
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:20,785
Monsoon season is bad. Now,

37
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,092
the trade winds are
blowing north right now.

38
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,927
Shipping lanes are north.

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,197
So north is exactly
where you want to be.

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,259
What's that mean?

41
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,931
It means, when the
monsoon season hits,

42
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,602
the trade winds
are gonna shift to the south.

43
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,646
The raft goes with the wind.

44
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:45,548
Can anyone tell me what is the only
piece of land that's south of us?

45
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,279
Antarctica.

46
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,015
That's right, Jack. Antarctica.

47
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,647
So when do we have to leave?

48
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,016
Yesterday.

49
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,132
So obviously you believe him.

50
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,641
Arzt? I don't know.
But I'm not taking any chances.

51
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,870
You think you'll be ready
by tomorrow?

52
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,977
Man said not a day to waste.

53
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,914
Supplies all set?
You got food, fresh water, every...

54
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,747
Look, Kate, no offense,
but I got work to do.

55
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,343
Why the sudden interest?

56
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,888
Because I'm going with you.

57
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:46,879
Look, raft's full.
We need four, we got four.

58
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,848
Look, raft's full.
We need four, we got four.

59
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,146
- Including Sawyer?
- Including him.

60
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,119
We needed the stuff he had,
so he bought his way on.

61
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,780
On the first raft,
which burned.

62
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,687
I'm not gonna get into semantics.

63
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,158
- I told the guy...
- He doesn't know how to sail.

64
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:02,387
And you do?

65
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,430
<i>I spent two summers
crewing Jlboats.</i>

66
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,624
I know my way around a sailboat.

67
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:12,032
Yeah... maybe so,
but a deal's a deal. I'm sorry.

68
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,763
You're bringing Walt too?

69
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,472
I'm just saying it's dangerous.

70
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,373
I decide what's best for my boy.

71
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,440
And right now, what's best for him
is to get the hell off this island.

72
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,042
The raft's full.

73
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,726
<i>Hospital chaplain to the neuro-ICU. </i>

74
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,662
<i>Hospital chaplain. 
Please report to the neuro-ICU. </i>

75
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:44,497
I have a delivery for Diane Jansen.

76
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,663
Right.
She just came up from ICU.

77
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,331
- She's in room 208.
- Okay.

78
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,137
Around the corner, to your right.

79
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,608
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

80
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,743
Hey, Tom.

81
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,409
Holy... Katie?

82
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,683
What are you doing here?

83
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,315
Diane's dying of cancer.

84
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,358
I thought I owed it to her
to come see her.

85
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,456
I heard. I'm sorry.

86
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,798
Yeah, me too.

87
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,839
So any particular reason why you're
hanging out in the back of my car?

88
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,309
I need your help.

89
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,945
How much further?

90
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,647
We're almost there.

91
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,917
Wanna tell me where
we're going, Sayid?

92
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,050
It's better that you see it
for yourself.

93
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,855
No, I'm not so sure it is.

94
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,362
Tell me why you brought me here
or I turn around.

95
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,697
He brought you out here
because I asked him to.

96
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,800
I asked him not to tell you.

97
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,905
I wanted you to have an open mind.

98
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,840
Open mind about what?

99
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,932
My God.

100
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,645
What is this thing?

101
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,475
Exactly.

102
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,317
I guess it's time
we talked about this.

103
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,590
Yo, chief!

104
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,233
Dumb question here.
We're sailing out on the ocean right?

105
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,460
You mind?

106
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:06,596
Sulu over here is packing
a suitcase full of salted fish.

107
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,832
Yeah?

108
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,098
We can't catch fish?

109
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,941
Do you know anything
about surviving at sea?

110
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,411
Sailing? Navigating?

111
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,449
- Steering a raft?
- Do you?

112
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,677
Doesn't matter what I know,
I built it.

113
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,349
Maybe you are the wrong guy
to go on the raft.

114
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,947
You gonna vote me off, Mickey?

115
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,831
And who the hell's
gonna take my place?

116
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,235
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- Sorry?

117
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,074
Don't give me the "Aw, golly" eyes.

118
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,582
Michael just told me you were
jockeying for my spot on the raft.

119
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,313
I was just asking some questions.
He must've misunderstood me.

120
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,920
I know what you're doing.

121
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,479
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,084
Just like I know why you wanted
that Haliburton case so bad.

123
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,892
The one that belonged to the U.S. Marshal
who was flying with us.

124
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,596
You were his prisoner.

125
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
Let go of me.

126
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,165
Your only chance of running's
getting on that raft, ain't it?

127
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,942
If we get picked up by a ship,

128
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,811
when they come back
to rescue the rest of y'all,

129
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,375
gonna be a nice big asterisk
next to your name.

130
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,082
Well, don't worry, puddin',

131
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,286
your secret's safe with me.

132
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,959
But just so you know,

133
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,329
no way in hell you're getting
my spot on that raft.

134
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,194
Hey, Sawyer!

135
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:53,040
I want your spot,
I'll get your spot.

136
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,819
Hey! Give me that water, man.

137
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,327
- Yo, Dad!
- Thanks.

138
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,533
So, what were you
and Sawyer arguing about?

139
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,906
I told him something
he didn't want to hear.

140
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,305
Why does he wanna get on
the raft so much?

141
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,075
'Cause he knows it's gonna work.

142
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,377
When we get rescued,

143
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,943
we're gonna come back
for everybody else, right?

144
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,819
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

145
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,619
But the thing is...

146
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,854
...this island...

147
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,925
...is... finding it
again might be hard.

148
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,769
Can't we fly around and look for it?

149
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,099
Absolutely.

150
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,407
But there's no guarantees.
That's why you and...

151
00:12:58,878 --> 00:12:59,936
Dad?

152
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,472
Ooh.

153
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,777
That's why you...

154
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,718
Dad!

155
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,650
- Dad!
- Get Jack.

156
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,532
Help!

157
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,509
I need help! It's my dad.

158
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,947
- What's the matter?
- His stomach is really bad.

159
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,279
Take him back to Michael.

160
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,514
- I'll go get Jack.
- Okay.

161
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,680
- Let's go.
- This way.

162
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,022
Jack!

163
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,254
Jack!

164
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,494
How long have you
known about this?

165
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,598
Three weeks, give or take.

166
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,798
Three weeks.

167
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,808
You've been out here for three weeks
digging this thing up

168
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,968
and you never told me?

169
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:08,938
All due respect, Jack,
but since when do I report to you?

170
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,915
All due respect, John,
but you lied.

171
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,714
How long did you have
that case full of guns

172
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,190
before you decided
the rest of us needed to know?

173
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,717
You used your best discretion.
I used mine.

174
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,600
So how do we open it?

175
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,433
What? You want to open it?

176
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,631
Yeah.

177
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,508
We should bury it.

178
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,045
I brought you here
to talk him out of this insanity.

179
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:44,446
- Anything could be inside.
- Best case scenario, there's supplies.

180
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,211
Worst case, we use it as a shelter.

181
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,311
Actually, Jack, I can think
of much worse cases than that.

182
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,356
You notice anything
about this hatch?

183
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,422
There's no handle.

184
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,756
Could the reason
for that be more obvious?

185
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,232
Maybe it was never meant
to be opened from the outside.

186
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,275
Jack! Jack!

187
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,005
Yeah! Over here!

188
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,281
It's Michael.
Something's wrong.

189
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,557
What'd you eat today?

190
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,763
Fruit, fish.

191
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,899
Drinking enough water?

192
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,230
Two, three bottles.

193
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,294
Where are you getting
that water from?

194
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,100
The caves, like everybody else.

195
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,800
All right, listen, Michael.

196
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,105
You just take it easy.
You stay in the shade.

197
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,804
You try not to move too much, Okay?

198
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:50,809
We have to launch that raft tomorrow.
We have to.

199
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,680
I know. I need you to lay back.

200
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,486
Lay down.

201
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,653
Just lay down. Okay?

202
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,563
Hello? Hey, Adam.
Hey, listen,

203
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,832
can you carve out some time
for me on the MRI?

204
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,006
Yeah, it's... it's a favor
for a friend of a friend.

205
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,769
Oh, no, that'll work out great.

206
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,541
Okay. Yeah, thanks, Adam.

207
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,546
His name's Connor.

208
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,713
How old is he?

209
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,087
Twenty-two months next week.

210
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,185
He's beautiful.

211
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:41,221
Yeah, well, that's Rachel,
that's not me.

212
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,562
Where is she?

213
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,470
She's over in Cedar Rapids
visiting her folks.

214
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,240
They get back on Sunday.

215
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,309
I got Diane in for an MRI.

216
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,679
They'll bring her
downstairs to radiology.

217
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,514
And her appointment's
not until 5 am,

218
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,146
so we've got about
three hours to kill.

219
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,087
- Tom...
- You're welcome.

220
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,659
You think it's still there?

221
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,725
What?

222
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,470
You know what.

223
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,575
It's the middle of the night, Katie.

224
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,239
We might not get another chance.

225
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,545
One, two, three,

226
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,950
four, five, six.

227
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,631
What do you think it is?
Heatstroke?

228
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,159
No. He would've
felt that coming on.

229
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,696
Bad fruit, maybe? Raw fish?

230
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,135
Michael and Jin
are on the same diet.

231
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,803
- And Jin's fine.
- Jin's fine.

232
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,541
Whatever's making him sick
was metabolized fast.

233
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,380
It hit him quick,
and it hit him hard.

234
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,579
So you think it was the water?

235
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,515
No, I don't think it was the water.

236
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,159
I think it was something
in the water.

237
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,004
Feeling any better?

238
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,336
Cramps are quieting down.

239
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:07,440
As long as I don't move,
or... or breathe.

240
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,716
You and Locke kiss and make up?

241
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,291
Good.

242
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,456
No, Michael.

243
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,929
What?

244
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,792
Drink from that one.

245
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,998
- Somebody did this to me?
- I don't know.

246
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,871
I'm not sure of anything yet.

247
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,409
Sawyer.

248
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,644
I'm on bamboo duty,
but sometimes I help refill the water.

249
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,447
Michael and Jin getting along?

250
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,648
They fight like a married couple
building a raft together.

251
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,346
You told him?

252
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,956
He thinks Sawyer might've done it.

253
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,393
Oh, 'cause of Kate?

254
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,128
- Kate?
- Yeah, I guess she wants on the raft.

255
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,395
So Sawyer went off
on Michael because

256
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,369
he gets to decide who goes.
You don't think Kate did it?

257
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,172
Why would Kate poison Michael?

258
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,404
Well, you know,
the whole fugitive thing.

259
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,914
He doesn't know?

260
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,424
How am I supposed to keep straight
who knows what?

261
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,460
- Steve didn't know about the polar bear.
- What did she do?

262
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,557
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?

263
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,294
You didn't think the others
should know about this?

264
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,234
Discretion, John.

265
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,244
Okay, can you stop moving
or I'm gonna cut your ear off.

266
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,944
This is good.

267
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,384
I'm writing again.

268
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm really feeling it, as well.

269
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,188
So, what's the first thing
you're gonna do

270
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,160
when we get rescued?

271
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,961
You know, I don't really know.

272
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,524
You can hang out with me in LA.

273
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,196
You and Turnip Head.
You know,

274
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,899
until you figure things out.

275
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,805
- Thanks.
- Smashing.

276
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:23,211
Okay. Check this out.
This is track two. It's called...

277
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,873
Sorry.

278
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,248
<i>It's called Monster Eats The Pilot. </i>

279
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:40,987
How's Michael?

280
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,161
He's gonna be fine.

281
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,296
Is somebody gonna be taking
his place on the raft?

282
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,471
I don't know.

283
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:58,209
- Dr. Arzt said if they don't leave...
- Did you poison Michael, Kate?

284
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:03,015
- What?
- He's not sick. Someone did this.

285
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,225
Do you really think
I'm capable of that?

286
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,603
I don't know what
you're capable of.

287
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,882
You brought beer?

288
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,016
No self-respecting man in lowa
goes anywhere without beer.

289
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,329
It's not fair, you know,

290
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,971
you coming back.

291
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,837
Here. Home.

292
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,812
Yeah, I know.

293
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,018
Wow.

294
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,822
- Wow! Look at this stuff.
- Oh, my God!

295
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,894
My plane.

296
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:59,360
I can't believe I let you talk me
into putting this in there.

297
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,065
That was your idea.

298
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,442
Kate and Tom.

299
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,974
1989.

300
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,978
<i>Is it on? </i>

301
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,150
<i>- I don't think it's on. 
- It's on. </i>

302
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:26,190
<i>Okay, uh, this is Kate Austen
and Tom Brennan. </i>

303
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:30,200
<i>And this is our dedication
for our time capsule</i>

304
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,169
<i>here on August 15th, 1989.</i>

305
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,603
<i>Hey, give me that back! </i>

306
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,301
<i>Why are you putting this
stupid plane in there? </i>

307
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,811
<i>Because it's cool, Katie. 
I got it when I flew to Dallas by myself. </i>

308
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,871
<i>Ooh, that is cool! 
Just like this time capsule. </i>

309
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:47,578
<i>It'll be totally cool when we
dig it up in, like, 20 years. </i>

310
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,643
<i>How do you know
we'll be together? </i>

311
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,951
<i>'Cause we'll be married. 
You'll be a mom</i>

312
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,924
<i>- and we'll have nine kids. 
- I don't think so. </i>

313
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,517
<i>As soon as I get my license, </i>

314
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,894
<i>we should just get in a car and drive. 
Like, you know, run away. </i>

315
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,956
<i>You always
wanna run away, Katie. </i>

316
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,131
<i>Yeah. 
And you know why. </i>

317
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,006
Funny how things turn out, huh?

318
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,302
Yeah.

319
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,718
Sorry.

320
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,695
We better get to the hospital.

321
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:08,227
Yeah.

322
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,108
What happened?

323
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,955
I had a little accident.

324
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,685
- Does it hurt?
- Yep.

325
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,564
Something you
wanna tell me, Walt?

326
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,830
I didn't do it.

327
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,261
Didn't do what?

328
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,867
I heard Jack.

329
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,942
He thinks somebody
got my dad sick.

330
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,975
And I didn't do it.

331
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,505
You think because I know
you burned the first raft

332
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,414
I'd think you
made your dad sick?

333
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,587
We're friends, aren't we Walt?

334
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,149
I didn't tell on you before,
and I'm not gonna now.

335
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,685
And I know you would never
do anything to hurt your dad.

336
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,664
- What's the matter?
- Don't open it.

337
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,937
- What did you say?
- Don't open it, Mr. Locke.

338
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,441
Don't open that thing.

339
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,840
What? What thing?
What are you...?

340
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,708
Just don't open it!

341
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,580
Thought you might need that, boss.

342
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:41,624
Wouldn't want our pilot out of
commission before takeoff.

343
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,652
What? You feeling guilty?

344
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,857
What?

345
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,829
You're off the raft.

346
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,327
Come again?

347
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,770
You're off the raft.

348
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,931
We had a deal.

349
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,999
Well, the deal ended
the minute you decided to poison me.

350
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,712
- I did what now?
- I'm done with you.

351
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,181
You ain't done with me
by a damn sight.

352
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,615
You said you needed four.

353
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,947
I got four.

354
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:12,456
You've been stealing stuff off of
dead bodies, keeping it for yourself,

355
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,016
using it to buy favors.
You're a liar and a criminal!

356
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,789
I'm not letting you near my boy!

357
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,354
Oh, I'm a criminal?
I poisoned you 'cause I'm a criminal?

358
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,624
Get your hands off me, boy.

359
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,571
Hey, sweet cheeks!

360
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,972
I had no idea how bad
you wanted off this rock.

361
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,706
Time to set things straight.

362
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,907
- Let go of me.
- Tell him who the criminal is.

363
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:40,109
- Leave her alone, man.
- Tell him.

364
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,817
- Give that back!
- Leave her alone.

365
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,120
- "Leave her alone."
- Give that back.

366
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,588
Look!

367
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,824
Look at this.

368
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,396
Sawyer, please.

369
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,038
You all remember Joanna,
don't you? Huh?

370
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,941
The woman who drowned?

371
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:10,947
Now, what's Kate doing
with poor Joanna's ID?

372
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,451
Could it be she'd do just about
anything to get on that raft,

373
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,885
so she could get herself rescued?

374
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,254
Run off with a new identity
before half the reporters in the world

375
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:21,917
descend on this damn island?

376
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,121
- She might poison the captain himself.
- Shut up.

377
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,465
She don't care about
nothing or nobody but herself.

378
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,981
This is good here.
Thank you.

379
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,323
My office is right back there.
I'll wait for you.

380
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,395
Hi, Mom.

381
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,302
Can you hear me?

382
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,036
Mom?

383
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,839
Mom?

384
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,687
It's me, Katie.

385
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,063
Katherine?

386
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:16,197
It's me... Katherine.

387
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,852
I'm so sorry for everything
that I have put you through.

388
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,497
Help. Help.

389
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,470
It's okay, Mom. It's just me.

390
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,271
Help! Help!

391
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,139
Shh. It's okay.

392
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,008
- Help!
- Mom.

393
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,048
Help. Help me!

394
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:01,313
Help me! Somebody!

395
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:05,846
Help me! Help me!

396
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,482
Somebody!

397
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,782
Help me!

398
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,919
What's going on?

399
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,930
I'm her daughter. She's confused.
I was getting a doctor.

400
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,898
Hang on.
We got a situation down...

401
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,971
- What happened?
- I need your car keys.

402
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,307
Kate? Katie?

403
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,668
- Get out.
- I am not letting you do this.

404
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:03,578
- You cooperate, they'll go easy.
- He's calling back-up. Get out!

405
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,616
- You can have a real life.
- Tom, please.

406
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:06,775
- No.
- Now!

407
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,310
- Get out!
- No!

408
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:37,809
Tom?

409
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,108
Tom?

410
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,510
Tom?

411
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,882
Oh, God. Tom!

412
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:49,017
No, no, no, no! Tom!
Come on, please wake up.

413
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,807
You wanna tell us
why you need to run so bad?

414
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,440
You wanna tell us the truth?

415
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,923
Yes. I was on the plane...

416
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,391
...with the Marshal.

417
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,929
Yes, I was wanted...

418
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,938
...and caught

419
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,535
and being transported back.

420
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,781
No matter what I say
about what happened,

421
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,477
about what I supposedly did...

422
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:52,156
...l'm going to jail.

423
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,160
But I didn't poison you.

424
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,798
Here.

425
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,282
- There you go.
- Good.

426
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,648
- There you go.
- Good.

427
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,037
He looks determined.

428
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,802
Yes. He is.

429
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,372
You don't want him to go,
do you?

430
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,143
No.

431
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,419
Is that why you tried
to make him sick?

432
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,725
Michael and Jin working together
all the time,

433
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,660
pretty easy for them to get
their water bottles mixed up.

434
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:50,971
I didn't want him to die out there.

435
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,778
I just didn't know what to do.

436
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,054
I only used enough to make him...

437
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,152
I wasn't trying to hurt him.

438
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,762
Are you gonna tell the others?

439
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,763
I don't see any reason
why they need to know.

440
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,500
But Sun...

441
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,640
...he's going.

442
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,638
If I were you, I'd...

443
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,584
I'd say goodbye.

444
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,421
I'm back on the raft.

445
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,931
Glad to hear it.

446
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,294
Michael's gonna cowboy up.

447
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,462
We set sail tomorrow.

448
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,904
Are you here to say sorry, Sawyer?

449
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,277
Sorry don't suit me.

450
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,484
You cornered me, Freckles.

451
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,953
- I did what I had to.
- I cornered you?

452
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,219
You said if you wanted my spot,
you were gonna take it.

453
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,123
Guess I believed you.

454
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:01,431
Well... that's that.

455
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,501
I got some packing to do.

456
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,975
Why is it so important for you
to be on that raft?

457
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,623
'Cause there ain't anything
on this island worth staying for.

458
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,613
Be safe, Sawyer.

459
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,611
Yeah.

460
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,401
- Dad?
- Hey, buddy!

461
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,098
You getting better?

462
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,871
Yeah. Yep, I'm gonna be all right.

463
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,413
Hey. Don't worry.

464
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,644
I'm gonna be on my feet soon

465
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,347
and we'll be sailing home
before you can even...

466
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,322
I'm the one that burned the raft.

467
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,458
I didn't wanna leave,
and I thought I could stop you.

468
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,530
I'm sorry.

469
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,538
I'm really sorry, Dad.

470
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,041
Hey, it's okay, man.

471
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,876
We can stay here.

472
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:02,723
You and me.
We don't have to go.

473
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,155
Yes, we do.

474
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,978
Hello.

475
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,871
Hey!

476
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,149
Jack knows.

477
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,694
I didn't tell him it was your idea.

478
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,066
Thanks.

479
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,205
Why should you be punished?

480
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,206
You were only trying to help me.

481
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,904
He said he
wouldn't tell the others.

482
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,376
Yeah.

483
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,811
Jack's good at keeping secrets.

484
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,588
When I was a little girl,

485
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:12,159
I believed that once
I found the man I loved...

486
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,024
...I would be happy...

487
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,697
...forever.

488
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,331
Yeah.

489
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,838
Me too.
