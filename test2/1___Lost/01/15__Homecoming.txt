00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:03,833
<i> Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,932
- Anyone seen Ethan?
- He took off to the beach.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,943
There might have been a struggle.

4
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,706
I think they've been taken.

5
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:35,158
If you do not stop following me,

6
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,760
I will kill one of them.

7
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,365
- Over here!
- Jack!

8
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,966
Where's Jack?

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,510
- We need the doctor.
- Right there.

10
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,481
- There.
- Find someone!

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,881
What happened?

12
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,180
Doctor!

13
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,381
- Claire!
- Is she alive?

14
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,788
- What happened?
- Is she all right?

15
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,618
Is she okay?

16
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,489
- Where'd you find her?
- A mile north, looking for the dog.

17
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,657
- Conscious?
- She collapsed in my arms.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,031
- Did she say anything?
- Is she injured?

19
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,029
Is she all right?

20
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,967
Everybody needs to back off, okay?
Just give her some air.

21
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,316
Claire. Can you hear me?

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,217
Wake up now. Hey. Claire.

23
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,319
Claire.

24
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,227
Wake up now.

25
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,728
Hey.

26
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,266
It's okay. Claire!

27
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,938
Hey, it's okay.

28
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,167
- It's okay.
- Claire.

29
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,240
Okay. You're safe.

30
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,473
Who are you?

31
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:06,483
Who are you?

32
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,993
Who are you people?

33
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,846
I don't understand.

34
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,080
I don't know any Ethan.

35
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,124
I... I don't remember.

36
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,822
I don't remember any of you.

37
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,661
I don't remember any of this.

38
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,136
What do you remember?

39
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,235
Um...

40
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,572
I was on a plane...

41
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,942
...um, flying to LA from Sydney.

42
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,948
Claire...

43
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,385
We were all on that plane.

44
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,981
It crashed here, on this island.

45
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,793
That was almost a month ago.

46
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,396
No! I'm due...

47
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,231
Your baby's fine.
He's kicking.

48
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,501
Everything's normal. Okay?

49
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,341
Well, if it's been a month,
then why hasn't somebody come to get us?

50
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,251
You think she escaped?

51
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,052
You were right beside me, Boone.
You know as much as I do.

52
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,255
But where'd she come from?

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,820
We were out pretty deep.

54
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,366
Nothing's out there.

55
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,035
She didn't say anything
about Ethan?

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,231
She doesn't even remember Ethan.

57
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,537
The guy pretends to be one of us,
he drags her into the jungle.

58
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,099
She doesn't remember him?

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,208
Apparently.

60
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,416
You think he's around?

61
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,083
I sure hope not.

62
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,519
Claire. Here's your journal.

63
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,456
It might help.

64
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,532
And this is where you sleep.
It's quite cozy, isn't it?

65
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,940
When he, Ethan...

66
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:22,147
...when he took you away,
he took me too.

67
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,819
The others came after us.

68
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,293
They got me back. But you...

69
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,886
You were gone.

70
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,997
Who is he? Ethan?

71
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,569
Ethan...

72
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,701
Ethan's the bad guy.

73
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,979
So we were together when...

74
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,675
Yeah.

75
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,982
Well, why did he leave you?

76
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,456
Why don't we leave that lovely story
for the morning?

77
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,424
You've had enough for one day.

78
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,986
No, I won't be sleeping.

79
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,797
Oh... lucky for me.

80
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,530
Not much of a sleeper myself.

81
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,799
Finally, I'll have someone
to stay up with.

82
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,474
We're... We're friends?

83
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:27,375
Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.

84
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,688
How's that feel, mate?

85
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,497
- Sodding fantastic.
- Good, 'cause we're almost out.

86
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,300
But we're not out yet?
Carpe diem, my friend.

87
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,773
Save your French for someone
who appreciates it.

88
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,402
Latin, Tommy. It's Latin.

89
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,208
Well, is it Latin for
"I've got a pile of money

90
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:59,945
so we can score vast quantities
of illicit substances"?

91
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,147
- No.
- I suppose you ought to clean up then.

92
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,315
It's time to put you to work.

93
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:19,170
Ms. Lucy Heatherton, 22
and ripe in oh, so many wonderful ways.

94
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,604
Just graduated from Oxford,

95
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,974
lives in Knightsbridge with dear
old dad, Mr. Francis Price Heatherton,

96
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,878
who, my friend,
is bloody loaded.

97
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,179
How you amass this information
never ceases to amaze me.

98
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,283
Ready to fall in love,
Mr. Charlie Pace

99
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,221
of the legendary rock band
Drive Shaft?

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,794
Absolutely.

101
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,533
Oh! Seriously, ladies, I demand you
stop buying me more drinks.

102
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,036
I'm a man of
high moral standing.

103
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:04,412
Your obvious plan to take me home
and ravage me will not work.

104
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,452
Saucy sirens.

105
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,511
I believe in monogamy.
I will not be shared like a curry.

106
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,319
- Are we that obvious?
- Dreadfully.

107
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,224
Call yourself ladies.
Jane Austen would be ashamed.

108
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,522
I personally
feel misunderstood. I'm sensitive.

109
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,464
The girl is pregnant.
Very pregnant.

110
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Are we to believe
that she escaped from him?

111
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,333
- What're you getting at?
- Ethan infiltrated us.

112
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,142
Whoever he is and wherever
he comes from, he's intelligent.

113
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,514
- Who's to say he didn't send Claire?
- You're off your head, mate.

114
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,349
Charlie. Calm down.
That's a stretch, Sayid.

115
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,549
Tell me, doctor, how many times
have you diagnosed amnesia?

116
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,458
- And such a selective brand of it?
- Okay. It's rare.

117
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,995
She's been through a trauma.

118
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:52,792
It is possible that her memory
reset to the crash.

119
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,195
And the chances of
that memory returning?

120
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,565
- I don't know.
- You know what?

121
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,735
Talk about Claire all you want.
I'm gonna spend time with her.

122
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,301
I get the impression
she might be a tad upset.

123
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,517
Oi, Jin.

124
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,715
You heading
back to the caves?

125
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,953
Safety in numbers, right?

126
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,431
Of course, you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

127
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,560
How nice it must be to not be involved
in the bloody insanity

128
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,162
that surrounds us at every turn.

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,105
It's quite beautiful really.

130
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:38,006
You take care of your wife.

131
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,739
Everything else
is someone else's problem.

132
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,146
No need to be involved in
the decision-making process.

133
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:48,016
No tree-shaking behemoths,
French transmissions.

134
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,555
Just sweet bloody ignorance.

135
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,318
You don't know
how lucky you are.

136
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,325
Must be nice.
You wake up and...

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,465
What?

138
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,779
Charlie, I want her back.

139
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,756
- What?
- I want you to bring her back.

140
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,257
What did you do to her?

141
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,755
What did you do?

142
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,600
You bring her here.

143
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:46,970
If you don't, I'm going to
kill one of them.

144
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,072
Then if you don't bring her back
before sundown tomorrow,

145
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,912
I'll kill another.

146
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,576
And another.

147
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,346
And another.

148
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,687
One every day.

149
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,317
And, Charlie,

150
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,429
I'll kill you last.

151
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,545
What do we do?

152
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,712
- We go out and we kill him.
- Calm down.

153
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,722
We don't want the others
to get upset.

154
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,089
- Forget them. He's out there now.
- I think he's right.

155
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,754
The man threatens
to kill one of us, and what?

156
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,764
We just wait for that to happen?

157
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,733
We tracked him once before.
We can track him again.

158
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,101
You've forgotten how that turned out.
He bested you. Physically.

159
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,333
He hung you from a tree.

160
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,773
Running into the jungle
is not gonna get it done.

161
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,539
- So, what does get it done?
- We circle the wagons.

162
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:57,104
Tell a select few, we post them
as sentries here and at the caves.

163
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,445
"Tell a select few"?

164
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,980
He does what he says he's gonna do,
and that blood's on our hands.

165
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:09,252
Okay, Jack, we tell everyone.

166
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,126
But you wanna protect them,
you need to think defense.

167
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:15,190
We move everybody off the beach
back up into the caves.

168
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,132
What if Ethan isn't alone?

169
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,062
What if he delivered his threat
so that we would gather like sheep

170
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,874
in a space where they could roll in
and take us all in one fell swoop?

171
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,614
Okay, John.

172
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,244
I mean, obviously you have a plan,
so let's hear it.

173
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,179
- The others are avoiding me.
- Sorry?

174
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,581
No one will talk to me.

175
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,519
You know, it just feels
like something's going on.

176
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,789
Anything coming back?

177
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,987
After the crash, no.

178
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:19,587
Some of this stuff
is probably better forgotten.

179
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,402
I don't know about you, but the rest
of us been having a wonderful time.

180
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,168
We even built a golf course.

181
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,735
You sure there's
nothing going on?

182
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,077
Absolutely.

183
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,214
Okay.

184
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,620
You're quite enamored of yourself.

185
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:56,259
Now, Lucy, I know it's our first date,
and you need to appear demure,

186
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,098
but if you want to
invite me for sex,

187
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,833
don't say "tea," say "sex."

188
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,307
- Do you want tea or not?
- I'd love some.

189
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,809
Brilliant.

190
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,244
So where is the old man?

191
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,906
I don't know.

192
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,383
I think he's buying
some paper company up in Slough.

193
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,411
Oh, yeah?

194
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:18,012
You two get on?

195
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,854
Dad's quite cool, actually.

196
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:24,794
He was proud when I told him I was going
on a date with a bona fide rock star.

197
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,736
It was Winston Churchill's.

198
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:38,265
Dad collects all sorts of rubbish
from the great leaders of the Empire.

199
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,142
- Hey, you should meet him.
- Winston? No, thanks.

200
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:44,705
- I heard he's quite moldy.
- My father.

201
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:48,116
He's coming back tomorrow.
You should come around for dinner.

202
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,278
I'd love to.

203
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,389
Excellent.

204
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,725
You look hungry.

205
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,370
Thanks.

206
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,250
Locke told us what happened.

207
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,087
Why do you think
he wants her back?

208
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,420
I don't know.

209
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,993
Maybe it's time you used that key
you've been wearing around your neck.

210
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,969
There are four 9 millimeters
in the case...

211
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,028
Uh-uh. No.

212
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,700
I hand them out, someone
hears something, gets scared...

213
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,678
Chance of shooting each other
is higher than shooting him.

214
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,179
We're beyond knives.

215
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,842
I'm not putting guns
in untrained hands.

216
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,291
Trip it.

217
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,757
Not bad.

218
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,026
Four around the perimeter
will do the job.

219
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,661
- I have fires at 20-meter intervals.
- Excellent.

220
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,002
Some have volunteered for sentry duty.
I'll put them on shifts.

221
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,132
I'll take a shift.

222
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,365
Okay.

223
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,175
Absolutely.
We're counting on you.

224
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,151
- Maybe we should move her.
- She's safer here.

225
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,249
What about the mountain?
Another cave?

226
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,557
- She's safer here.
- Nobody's safe!

227
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,298
Hey.

228
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,835
It's my fault he took her.
I was responsible.

229
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,268
I should've taken care of her.
I should've...

230
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,642
Nothing's gonna
happen to her. Okay?

231
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,506
Yeah. Okay.

232
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,250
I think my daughter would agree that

233
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:14,129
you are the most impressive person
who's ever had dinner with us.

234
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,030
My condolences, sir.

235
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,901
I don't know if Lucy mentioned it,
but I was in a band once, you know.

236
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,337
Oh!

237
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,807
They were called
The Protestant Reformation.

238
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,434
Yes. Ouch! Dreadful.

239
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,811
You gave it up, then?

240
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,542
Well, I was married,
Lucy was on the way.

241
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,312
Her mum, God rest her soul,
wanted me to keep trying,

242
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,650
but I always wanted
to be more practical.

243
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,087
Responsible, I guess.

244
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,594
You know, a man has to provide,
take care of his family.

245
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,754
A man has to think
about the future.

246
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,991
And, of course,
your band was bloody awful.

247
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,466
Yes, there was that too.
Small detail.

248
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,560
So, are you working
on a new album?

249
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,737
We're in a bit of
a hiatus right now.

250
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,307
Liam, my brother,
just had a daughter.

251
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,545
So, you know,
we're taking some time off.

252
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,457
Quite a lot of time off.

253
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,222
It's been a year
since we were together.

254
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,124
I'm thinking of doing
a solo project.

255
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,501
Liam and I don't exactly
keep in touch,

256
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,100
and there's been
some problems with...

257
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,007
...royalties.

258
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,545
The fact of the matter is, sir, uh,

259
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,350
I think that Drive Shaft

260
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,085
might be dead.

261
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,566
- You took a sodding what?
- A job.

262
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,794
A job? Doing what?

263
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,268
- Selling copiers.
- You took a job selling copiers?

264
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,502
- I like her.
- She's a moose.

265
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,511
- Don't say that.
- Are you off your bleeding chump, man!

266
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,878
I've been getting you off on my scag
for over a week now, on spec.

267
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,509
- Spec means "speculation."
- Yes, I know what...

268
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,419
In this case, the speculation that
you'll execute your end of the plan

269
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,583
and steal something of value
which I can in turn sell.

270
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,991
By the time the bird
realizes it's missing,

271
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:27,225
it never even occurs to her
that rock star Charlie bloody Pace

272
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,326
could be responsible for such larceny,
and the bloody party continues.

273
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,704
Look, I...

274
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,269
I don't think Liam's coming back.

275
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,506
- I have to think about my future.
- Future?

276
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,570
- Yeah.
- Really?

277
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,209
- Yes.
- When do you start this job?

278
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:49,254
- Monday.
- Well, today's Friday, isn't it?

279
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,382
A full weekend without a fix.
Monday should be bloody wonderful.

280
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,518
Let's see how the future
treats you then, eh, Charlie?

281
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,747
Over here.

282
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,588
The tree line.
Something tripped the alarm.

283
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,934
I think we found
another missing castaway.

284
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:00,116
- What happened?
- Is he alive?

285
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,880
- Oh, God.
- How did he get past us?

286
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,466
I thought those guys
had the full-on perimeter set up.

287
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,007
Locke said it didn't matter.

288
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,971
He came in from the water.

289
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,178
You sure it wasn't an accident?
I mean, maybe the guy just drowned.

290
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,048
His neck was broken. Both arms.
All bones in his fingers.

291
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:41,490
Yeah. Okay. Got it.

292
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,260
Guess old Steve
drew the short straw.

293
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,461
Dude, that was Scott.

294
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,714
Scott Jackson worked for
an Internet company in Santa Cruz.

295
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,218
He won a sales prize.

296
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:11,414
Two-week Australian vacation,
all expenses paid.

297
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,488
He was a good guy.

298
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,126
I'm sorry I kept
calling you Steve, man.

299
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,529
- Um... Amen, I guess.
- Amen.

300
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,333
I don't know how to end these.

301
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,686
Hi. Um...

302
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,589
Why is everyone staring at me?

303
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,224
- I'm not staring at you.
- What's your name?

304
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,690
- Shannon.
- Shannon, you're staring.

305
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,007
- You mean nobody's told you?
- Told me what?

306
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,542
Why? Why did you lie to me?

307
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,173
- Okay, look...
- What else didn't you tell me?

308
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,844
I thought there wasn't
anything that you could do.

309
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,387
Nothing I could do?

310
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,085
Why would you keep me in the dark?

311
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,023
I'm already in the dark.

312
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,955
Sorry.

313
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,194
I just wanted to
take care of you.

314
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,532
I can take care of myself.

315
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,809
Look at you. Charlie Pace,
respectable businessman.

316
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,182
You didn't have
to buy me this suit.

317
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,484
Mm-hmm. What did you intend
on wearing for your first day?

318
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,389
I have shirts with buttons.

319
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,155
- You okay?
- Yeah, just nervous.

320
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,200
Don't be. Dad's put the fix in.

321
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:05,464
He's demanded they buy two copiers
to boost your confidence.

322
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,596
Ah!

323
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,938
- You memorized the manual?
- Backwards and forwards.

324
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,112
Say something impressive.

325
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,483
Uh...

326
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:25,489
The Heatherton C815
Copy Center's leading scan offerings

327
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,287
combine the benefits
of document capture

328
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,922
with instant delivery
anywhere, anytime.

329
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,592
- Anywhere?
- Anytime, baby.

330
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:40,463
You've been on stage in front
of thousands of screaming fans.

331
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,736
This is just some men who want
to buy a silly copy machine.

332
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,244
You're gonna do great.
I believe in you.

333
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,941
Oh! I almost forgot. Wait here.

334
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:52,347
Okay.

335
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,733
All right,
I know you'll protest,

336
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,167
but you simply can't be respected
unless you have one of these.

337
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,501
Oh, Lucy.

338
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,937
You're welcome.

339
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,676
Okay, well...

340
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,714
I'm gonna be late. The bus...

341
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,647
The bus? Are you daft?

342
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,811
- I'm driving you.
- Oh, no, I'd rather you didn't.

343
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,152
No arguments.
You have everything you need?

344
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,354
- Yeah.
- Then let's get you to work.

345
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,028
John.

346
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,231
Wanna take a walk?

347
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,809
What happens after the sun sets?

348
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,641
Well, if we don't
bring Claire to him?

349
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,375
Rhetorical, Jack.

350
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,009
Same thing happens tonight
happened last night.

351
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,485
- You think you can track him?
- What, I'm sorry?

352
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,681
We know where
he attacked Jin and Charlie.

353
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
You think you could
pick up the trail?

354
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,090
- Maybe, but I wouldn't.
- Wouldn't?

355
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,992
Jack, I'm not a cold man.

356
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,896
I feel for the loss
of one of our own.

357
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,867
But nothing fundamental's changed.

358
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:21,201
Whoever he is, wherever he comes from,
we're on Ethan's turf.

359
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,705
He has the advantage.

360
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:26,938
To him we're nothing more than
scared idiots with sharp sticks.

361
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,411
What if I told you that I had
a way to get the advantage back?

362
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,819
Then I would ask,
"What way might that be?"

363
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,181
Why, doctor,
you've been holding out on us.

364
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,680
I'm guessing you know
how to handle one of these.

365
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,506
Are you insane?

366
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,608
- It's the best chance we have.
- No bloody way.

367
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:42,676
To capture Ethan, we have to
ensnare him. The only way to do it

368
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,518
- Is by giving him what he wants.
- You have no idea.

369
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,081
This guy, he will kill all of you.

370
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,959
- You can't protect yourself...
- Charlie! I can talk for myself.

371
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,788
Claire.
They want to use you as bait.

372
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,001
I don't remember Ethan.

373
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,733
I don't remember
what he did to me.

374
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:05,833
But if I can help stop him
from hurting anyone else,

375
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,400
I have to do that.

376
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,647
I'm coming with you.

377
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,684
You said there were four guns.

378
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,050
You ever fire a weapon, Charlie?

379
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,591
All right, we should do this.

380
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,228
Let's figure out a game plan.
All right, Sayid, soldier.

381
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,360
Locke, you're the hunter.

382
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,031
Allow me to demonstrate
the awesome speed

383
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,506
of the C815 using...

384
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,337
...one of your...

385
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,574
...technical manuals.

386
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,725
Not a problem.
There's probably... something in here.

387
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,307
One second. One second.

388
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,270
Bear with me.

389
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,218
Charlie's right.

390
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,853
About what?

391
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,527
We have four guns.
We should have four men.

392
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,501
<i>Help? Moi? </i>

393
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,943
You know how to
handle a gun or not?

394
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,572
I know at least one
polar bear seems to think so.

395
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,689
Where'd you get
the hardware, hoss?

396
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,320
I wanna come.

397
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,425
Sorry. We're out of guns.

398
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:08,329
And no one goes
out there unarmed.

399
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,791
How much ammo you got?

400
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,165
- Hundred rounds, give or take.
- All nines, right?

401
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,736
Nine millimeters? The guns?

402
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,474
Yeah. Why?

403
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,483
'Cause if the lady wants to come...

404
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,226
Lifted this off the marshal
back in the old days.

405
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,790
You remember him, don't you?

406
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:41,320
Surly guy, kind of a square jaw?
Carried a Sig nine?

407
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,732
Yeah. I remember you shot him.
And missed.

408
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,705
Yeah, well... bygones.

409
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:54,241
And, hell, five guns
are better than four.

410
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,523
You'll be surrounded
at five points.

411
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,532
Everyone will be in visual contact.

412
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,694
Make sure you stay
in the area I've shown you.

413
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,201
And remember, the guns are
a measure of the last resort.

414
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,707
We want him alive.

415
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,381
Over here.

416
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,518
Jack's got him.

417
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,525
Hold your fire. Don't shoot!

418
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,086
We want him alive.

419
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,298
Claire!

420
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,776
- You all right?
- Yeah.

421
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,507
Over here.

422
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,812
- Hey! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

423
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,569
Winner by a knockout.
Nice one, doc.

424
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,765
Maybe somebody can tell me
who or what this son of a bitch is.

425
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,576
Uh-uh-uh, jungle boy,
not even for one sec.

426
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,183
Charlie?

427
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,131
Why did you do it, Charlie?

428
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,776
'Cause he deserved to die.

429
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,678
He could've told us
where he came from.

430
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,516
What he wanted with Claire.

431
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,387
Do you really think
he would've told us anything?

432
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:15,956
I wasn't gonna let that animal
anywhere near her again.

433
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,295
Ever.

434
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,985
Lucy.

435
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,753
I'm sorry.
I've been having some problems.

436
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,988
- If I could just explain.
- Leave, Charlie.

437
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,155
Lucy.

438
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,530
- I made a mistake.
- You made a mistake?

439
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,899
My father's sales manager
comes to my house

440
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,962
to return a cigarette case
the EMTs pulled from your pocket

441
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,941
at the bloody hospital,
and it still smells of your sick.

442
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,342
- I didn't mean...
- Oh, you meant to.

443
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,542
You meant to from the start.
You're a liar.

444
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,380
I believed you, and you lied!

445
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,886
I thought you wanted to...

446
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,082
You said...

447
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,125
You selfish bastard!

448
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,683
- If I can just explain...
- Just tell me one thing,

449
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,821
and don't you dare lie to me.

450
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:23,060
I get why you
pretended to like me.

451
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,032
I understand why you stole,

452
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,401
because you're a junkie,

453
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,377
but I don't understand
why you took the job.

454
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,839
Why did you take the job, Charlie?

455
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,818
I guess I...

456
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,825
...wanted to be respectable.

457
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,897
I wanted you to think
that I could take care of you.

458
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,243
You'll never take care of anyone.

459
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,481
I remember peanut butter.

460
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,685
Why do I remember peanut butter?

461
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,398
It was imaginary
peanut butter, actually.

462
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,243
I don't know what happened to me.

463
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,448
I'm scared.

464
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,819
I want to trust you.

465
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,336
Good night, Charlie.

466
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,275
Good night, Claire.
