1
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,903
Help me!

2
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,419
Walt, you gotta
keep that dog quiet.

3
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:03,952
I don't know what's wrong with him.
Come on, Vincent. Cut that out!

4
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,555
Aw...

5
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,101
Hey. Sorry. Sorry.

6
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,586
What's he barking at?

7
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:38,293
- What is it?
- Somebody's in there.

8
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,197
- Everyone in there's dead.
- Sawyer.

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,758
Right behind you, jackass.

10
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,803
Jack.

11
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,616
I'm gonna shed
some light on this thing.

12
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,888
- Run! Get out of here!

13
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,926
Oh, crud. Now what?

14
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,770
Come on.

15
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:10,578
- They've gone.

16
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,989
What the bloody hell was that?

17
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,118
Boars.

18
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,682
- Those boars were looking to feed.

19
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,718
We have to get rid of the bodies.

20
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:42,050
Bury them?
There's a whole bunch in there.

21
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,420
More than 20. Digging will
be difficult without shovels.

22
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:49,086
Not bury.
We need to burn them.

23
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,862
- They're people.
- I know they're people, Kate.

24
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,959
Burning the remains.
They deserve better than that.

25
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:01,496
Better than what? Being eaten by wild
animals? That's what's gonna happen.

26
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,543
Any bodies we bury are not
gonna stay buried for long.

27
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:09,344
Look, I know this seems harsh,
but that fuselage in the sun...

28
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,246
It's not about what they deserve.

29
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,346
They're gone, and... we're not.

30
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,754
What you say may be true,

31
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:23,421
but for us to decide how these
people are laid to rest, it's not right.

32
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,932
No regard for their wishes?
Their religions?

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,400
We don't have time
to sort out everybody's god.

34
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,097
Last I heard,
we were positively made of time.

35
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,607
I'm not happy about it.
We crashed a thousand miles off course.

36
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:39,042
They're looking in the wrong place.
It's been four days.

37
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,477
No one's come.

38
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,915
Tomorrow morning we need everyone
to start gathering up wood, dried brush.

39
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,851
We'll turn that fuselage
into a furnace.

40
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:53,785
Wait until the sun goes down
tomorrow night before we set the fire.

41
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,956
If he's so eager to burn the bodies,
why are we waiting till sundown?

42
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,861
He's hoping someone will see it.

43
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,482
Looks like I'm not the only one
who didn't sleep last night.

44
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,991
There are better things to do
with my time than collect firewood.

45
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,084
You don't agree with Jack.

46
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,826
- What are you making?
- Too soon to talk about.

47
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,837
I'm not sure if it will even work.

48
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,739
Trying to pick up the transmission?
The one we heard on the transceiver.

49
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,677
If the French woman's transmissions have
been playing on a loop for 16 years,

50
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,873
there must be a power source
on the island.

51
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,438
A significant one.

52
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,008
- And you can find it?
- Hypothetically, yes.

53
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,318
I'm making an antenna of sorts.

54
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,553
With a few of these mounted
at different points on the island,

55
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,720
I may be able
to triangulate the signal,

56
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,993
- Find out where it's coming from.
- So, what can I do to help?

57
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,001
It appears you're as anxious
to get off this island as I am.

58
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,668
Catch the ball.
Catch the ball, Vincent. Good boy.

59
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,604
Good job, Vincent.

60
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,388
Hey, hey, where you going, man?

61
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,552
Nowhere. I just thought
I'd see what Mr. Locke was doing.

62
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,590
Hey, why don't you
help your dad with the wood?

63
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,159
I'm sure Mr. Locke doesn't want
a kid hanging around him all day.

64
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,638
At least he talks to me.

65
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,641
Come on, Vincent.

66
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,473
- What's your problem? Hand 'em over!
- How about no?

67
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,513
There's other people here.

68
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,071
If one of us wouldn't eat
more than his fair share!

69
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,674
- That's bull!
- Knock it off.

70
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,015
You're not happy
unless you're screwing...

71
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,554
- I'm peachy.
- Knock it off!

72
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,056
- Stay out of this, metro!
- Hey!

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,924
- What's going on?
- Jethro's hoarding the peanuts.

74
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,089
My own stash.
I found it in there.

75
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,263
- What about the rest of the food?
- There is no rest of the food, dude.

76
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,636
- We kinda... ate it all.
- What?

77
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,143
Nothing's left?
What are you talking about?

78
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,242
- Okay, everybody, just calm down.
- We can find food.

79
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,150
There are plenty of things
we can use for sustenance.

80
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,621
And exactly how are we
gonna find this sustenance?

81
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,586
We hunt.

82
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,056
How'd you get
that knife on the plane?

83
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,795
Checked it.

84
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,497
You either have very good aim,

85
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,006
or very bad aim, Mr...

86
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,835
Locke. His name is Locke.

87
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,811
Mr. Locke,
what is it that we're hunting?

88
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,708
We know there are
wild boar on the island.

89
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,979
Razorbacks, by the look of them.

90
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,385
The ones that came into the camp
were piglets.

91
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,390
A hundred, 150 pounds each.

92
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,983
Which means
that there's a mother nearby.

93
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,188
A 250-pound rat

94
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,528
with scimitar-like tusks
and a surly disposition

95
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,694
who'd love nothing more
than to eviscerate anything near.

96
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,897
A boar's mode of attack is
to circle and charge from behind,

97
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,909
so it will take three to distract her
long enough for me to flank a piglet,

98
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,605
pin it and slit its throat.

99
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,308
And you gave him his knife back?

100
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,441
Well, if you've got a better idea...

101
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,214
Better than three of you
wandering into the forest

102
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,916
to bag a hunk o' ham with nothing
but a little bitty hunting knife?

103
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,425
Hell, no.
It's the best idea I ever heard.

104
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,342
<i>- Who is this guy?</i>

105
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,549
<i>- Yes?
- Colonel, is this line secure? </i>

106
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,021
<i>- Line secure. GL-12, go ahead.
- Target area is acquired. </i>

107
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,586
<i>Maneuvers are a go for 1300 hours. 
Repeat: We are a go. </i>

108
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,464
Roger that. We'll convene at the
usual rendezvous point at 1300 hours.

109
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:33,028
Locke! I told you I need those
TPS reports done by noon today.

110
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:37,371
- Not 12:30, not 12:15. Noon.
- I heard you the first time, Randy.

111
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:41,209
And no personal calls
during office hours, colonel.

112
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,089
So...

113
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,463
...hunting boar now, huh?

114
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,369
Who says this is
my first time boar hunting?

115
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,804
Uh-huh.

116
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,673
Tell me, how come anytime there's a hike
into the heart of darkness, you sign up?

117
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,609
You know what's in there.

118
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,171
Actually, I don't.

119
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,984
And neither do you.

120
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,981
What's your feel
on our new friend?

121
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,490
He seems to know
what he's doing.

122
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,154
Call me paranoid, but anyone
who packs a suitcase full of knives...

123
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,289
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're worried about me.

124
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,302
If I didn't know better, I'd say you
have a problem staying in one place.

125
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,136
You wanna tell me
why you're really going?

126
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,007
Sayid gave me this so he can triangulate
the distress signal we heard.

127
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,851
- Find the source.
- This isn't about boars?

128
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,117
I'm a vegetarian.

129
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,496
- But why can't I come?
- 'Cause I said so.

130
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,465
Hi. Hi. Excuse me.

131
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,061
Um...

132
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,701
Um...

133
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,176
Look, I am going off,

134
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,079
away to, uh, hunt,

135
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,912
and I was wondering if you...

136
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,444
if you could keep an eye

137
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,583
on my boy, Walt.

138
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,390
And I'm Michael.

139
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,430
Anyway,

140
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,159
could you watch him for me

141
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,498
until I come back?

142
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,634
Sorry, I don't understand,

143
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,407
but you're cool with this, right?

144
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:00,177
- I don't need a baby-sitter.
- Come on, man. Vincent needs you here.

145
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,551
This will give me a chance to get
to know your friend Mr. Locke.

146
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,753
Yeah. Whatever.

147
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,365
Excuse me. Doctor?

148
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,433
It's Jack.

149
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,678
- Claire, right?
- Yeah.

150
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,684
- How's the...?
- Oh, he's good. Yeah. Thanks.

151
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,086
I thought maybe
you should see this.

152
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,124
Someone found it in there.

153
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,625
They're collecting
all the belongings.

154
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:47,089
They're wedding plans
for Steve and Kristen.

155
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,966
They were on the plane sitting
a couple of rows behind me.

156
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,903
I remember because
they looked so happy.

157
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,771
I don't understand
what I'm supposed to do with this.

158
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,470
Oh, well, some of us
were wondering

159
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,410
if maybe we should
do some kind

160
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,472
of memorial service or something.

161
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,381
You could lead it.

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,987
Uh...

163
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,217
- No, I don't think...
- Well, you know, just a few words,

164
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,452
or even we could just
read off names

165
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,654
from passports and driver's...

166
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,596
- Look, it's not my thing.
- Oh, okay.

167
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,403
- Maybe I'll do it.
- Yeah. Sounds fine.

168
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,463
Whatever everybody wants.

169
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,285
That woman is still sitting there.

170
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,623
- Her husband was on the plane.
- Great.

171
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,632
- Are you listening to me?
- What's a four-letter word

172
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,100
for "I don't care"?

173
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,128
- I think somebody should talk to her.
- I nominate you, Captain America.

174
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,300
You just can't help yourself,
can you?

175
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:07,038
You don't have to worry about
starving with me taking care of you.

176
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,776
- I'm not gonna starve.
- Right. What are you gonna eat?

177
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,716
Ocean's full of fish.

178
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,656
Hate to break it to you.

179
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:22,182
The ocean is not gonna
take your gold card.

180
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,560
You really don't think
I can catch a fish?

181
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,631
You find something?

182
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:34,770
The ground here
has been rooted up.

183
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,173
That's how boars get the majority
of their food. They dig.

184
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,305
Afterwards, they generally wallow in
the dirt and rub up against the trees,

185
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,315
scoring it with their tusks.

186
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,544
Okay. So, what's all that mean?

187
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,952
It means we're close.

188
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,199
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,175
- Shannon, right?
- Yeah.

190
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,675
Are you doing anything?

191
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,641
Me? No, I was just...

192
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,112
What are you doing?

193
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,206
Um...

194
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,082
I was just gonna go for a walk.

195
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,381
You want to come?

196
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,986
Yeah. Yes.

197
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,726
Sure.

198
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,199
Can I ask you something?

199
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,562
I wondered when this
was gonna come up.

200
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:41,231
- Yes, I am the bass guitarist in...
- Do you know anything about fishing?

201
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,241
What? Fishing?

202
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,903
My granddad used to take me out.

203
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,776
Taught me everything he knows.
Everything he knew.

204
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,816
He's dead now, God rest his soul.
Yeah, I'm like a...

205
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:55,411
I'm a fishing fiend. You know,
I mean, England's an island,

206
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,184
so I just throw it in and fish.

207
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:01,951
Good.

208
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,190
Hey, doc, you got a second?

209
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,530
What's up?

210
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,504
That woman's been sitting
over there by herself.

211
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,474
Maybe she's having trouble
dealing with her husband.

212
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,273
I don't think she's had
anything to eat or drink.

213
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,579
Think maybe you could
go talk to her?

214
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,312
Why me? I'm not a psychiatrist.
Maybe you should...

215
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,946
Just thought
you might want to do it.

216
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,456
You're the one
that saved her life.

217
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,403
Hi.

218
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,576
Rose, right?

219
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,609
You remember me?

220
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,917
Seat 23A. I was...

221
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,787
...the guy that told you not
to worry about the turbulence.

222
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,959
Everybody's getting pretty
worried about you, Rose.

223
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,092
You want to be alone, fine,
but take care of yourself.

224
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,730
You should really drink.

225
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,336
Okay.

226
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:30,076
We don't have to talk.
Let's just sit... for a while.

227
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:40,082
How's your son?
How's he handling all this?

228
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,627
A hell of a lot better than I am.

229
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,157
You must be proud.
He's a brave kid.

230
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,893
Yeah. I can't take credit for that.

231
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,528
I wasn't part of his life till
his mother passed away two weeks ago.

232
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,902
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- That's okay.

233
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,737
They were living in Sydney
the past couple of years.

234
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,143
- I flew out last week to go get him.

235
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,948
- What were you doing?

236
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,742
Shh.

237
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,436
Hey, quit giving us
the steal signal.

238
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,550
Ah!

239
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,220
Oh!

240
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,329
Oh, God. Michael.

241
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,471
Oh, God!

242
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,137
Ah!

243
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,572
It's bad.

244
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,576
<i>Move. </i>

245
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,451
<i>You've got to move, colonel. </i>

246
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,649
Your troops are across enemy lines.

247
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,021
Patience,

248
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,618
a quality which you lack, GL-12,

249
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,527
is the hallmark of a leader.

250
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,532
Hallmark, huh?

251
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,700
Tell me more
about being a leader, Locke.

252
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,738
And while you're at it,
tell me about this colonel thing.

253
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,608
I perused your file
in Human Resources.

254
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,080
You've never been in any
of the armed forces.

255
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,741
I'm just playing a game, Randy.

256
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,251
It's my lunch hour.
I can play a game.

257
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,117
Yeah.

258
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,850
Tell me, what's a walkabout?

259
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,519
"Experience the dream journeys

260
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,188
of the fabled Australian outback."

261
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,561
You have no right
taking that off my desk.

262
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:37,124
So you wander around

263
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:40,035
hunting and gathering food, right?

264
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,596
- On foot?
- Not that you would understand,

265
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,871
but a walkabout
is a journey of spiritual renewal

266
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:50,278
where one derives strength from the
earth and becomes inseparable from it.

267
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,251
I have vacation days. I'm going, Randy.
I already made a reservation.

268
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,651
Wow, John,
you're really doing it, huh?

269
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,451
You tell Helen yet?

270
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,220
Helen? What's this, Locke?

271
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,320
- You've got a woman in your life.
- None of your business.

272
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:09,390
What is it with you, Locke?
Why do you torture yourself?

273
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,301
I mean, imagining you're some hunter?

274
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,566
And walkabouts?
Wake up.

275
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,733
You can't do any of that.

276
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,072
Norman Croucher.

277
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,274
- What? Norman what?
- Norman Croucher. Norman Croucher.

278
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,782
Double amputee, no legs.

279
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,081
He climbed to the top
of Mount Everest.

280
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,486
Why? It was his destiny.

281
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,150
That's what you think
you got, old man?

282
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,625
Destiny?

283
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,397
Just...

284
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:44,324
<i>...don't tell me what I can't do.
- John. </i>

285
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,598
<i>He's hurt. </i>

286
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,368
- John? Can you hear me?

287
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,872
Locke! John, you okay?

288
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,748
Locke?

289
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,083
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Helen.

290
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,282
I just got the wind
knocked out of me is all.

291
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,917
- Helen?
- God!

292
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,893
- What?
- You called me Helen.

293
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,790
Did I?

294
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:20,095
- Which way'd that boar go?
- Michael's hurt.

295
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,608
- We have to get him back to camp.
- Yeah, you take him back to camp.

296
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,269
I'm gonna get that boar.

297
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,370
What are you talking about?

298
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,916
I'm fine. I can do this.

299
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,382
John, you can't.

300
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,719
Don't tell me what I can't do.

301
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,095
- Get it?
- Dude, quit asking me that.

302
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:50,328
Sorry. It's just you said
you knew how to fish.

303
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,166
Yeah, off the Santa Monica Pier
with my old man

304
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,365
and a fishing pole and bait.

305
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,035
Never had to try to poke one
with a sharp stick.

306
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,412
Well... really appreciate
you helping me out. Thanks.

307
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,848
Hey...

308
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,511
...anything that keeps me
away from that fuselage.

309
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,987
And that freakin' redneck jerk!

310
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,828
Damn it! Crap! Crap!
Son of a...

311
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,487
You want me to have a go?

312
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,933
- Knock yourself out.
- All right.

313
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,469
Okay, here comes one.

314
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,566
Put your weight into it.
Easy. Wait for it.

315
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,907
Wait. Now!

316
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,179
Dude, you got to try to pin it.

317
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,947
Did you see how close I was?
You said not to corner it.

318
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,550
Dude.

319
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,918
Yeah.

320
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,001
Excuse me.

321
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,472
- Your name's Sayid, right?
- Yes.

322
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,567
I found this.
It's got your name on it.

323
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,048
I thought I'd lost this.

324
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,677
- Thank you.
- Sure.

325
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,674
His fingers swell.

326
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,319
Sorry?

327
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,852
Bernard.
My husband.

328
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,019
His hands swell up
whenever we fly.

329
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,425
The altitude.

330
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,434
He started having me
hold on to his wedding ring

331
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,232
whenever we took a plane trip.

332
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,932
I always wore it around my neck
for safekeeping,

333
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,907
just until we landed.

334
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:20,242
You know, doctor, you don't
have to keep your promise.

335
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,911
- Promise?
- The one you made me on the plane,

336
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,586
to keep me company until my husband
got back from the restroom?

337
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,152
I'm letting you off the hook.

338
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,902
Well, you're not gonna
get rid of me that easily.

339
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:43,373
Rose, you shouldn't
be out here alone.

340
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,875
You're suffering
from post-traumatic shock.

341
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,203
Aren't we all?

342
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,815
Yeah, I guess we are.

343
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:59,050
You have a nice way about you.

344
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,722
A good soul.

345
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,694
Patient, caring.

346
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,892
I suppose that's why
you became a doctor.

347
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,935
Thanks, but...

348
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,565
...I was just kinda born into it.

349
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,870
Family business.

350
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,052
I have never felt so alive.

351
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:37,353
Getting to finally
tell Randy off was...

352
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,230
...life-changing.
I mean it.

353
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,033
Now I'm free to do all those things
I ever wanted to do,

354
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,404
things that I know
I was destined to do,

355
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,999
like we talked about, Helen.

356
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:55,706
<i>It's wonderful, John. 
I'm happy for you. Really. </i>

357
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,717
I haven't even told you the best part.
Do you remember the...

358
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,515
...authentic aboriginal walkabout?

359
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,250
<i>Sure. That's all you've
talked about for weeks. </i>

360
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:09,919
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do it.

361
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,793
I'm flying to Australia
at the end of the week.

362
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,491
And I've...

363
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,001
I bought two tickets.

364
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,941
<i>- Helen?
- John, we've talked about this. </i>

365
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,478
<i>- I like you. 
- Yeah. I know.</i>

366
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,809
<i>I've enjoyed talking
these past months. </i>

367
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,681
<i>- Eight months.
- I'm not allowed to meet customers. </i>

368
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,419
A customer? Is...?

369
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,583
Is that what I am to you?

370
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,857
<i>This isn't really normal. 
I mean, it isn't what I do. </i>

371
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,524
<i>Maybe you should find a, 
I don't know, therapist. </i>

372
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,331
<i>- I have a therapist.
- John... </i>

373
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,869
I thought you understood.
You know me better than anyone.

374
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,671
<i>If we talk longer, I'm gonna
charge you for another hour. </i>

375
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,473
<i>That's another $89.95.</i>

376
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,844
I don't care about the money! I just...

377
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,712
<i>I'm sorry, John. I got to go. </i>

378
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,311
Helen, Helen.
Helen! Helen!

379
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,129
- Hey. Hey, wait a minute.
- What?

380
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,192
Just rest here for a minute.

381
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,967
I thought the guy with the gimpy leg
should be deciding when we rest.

382
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,607
Hey, what are you doing?

383
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,043
Trying to boost the transceiver signal.

384
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,906
I'm gonna climb this tree...

385
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,112
...and attach an antenna.

386
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,417
- You're gonna climb that?
- Yeah.

387
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,824
Don't worry.
Climbed a lot worse.

388
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,636
Locke.

389
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

390
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,623
These were...

391
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,125
I found these
the other day when I was...

392
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:42,529
- Hell, just take it.
- Thank you.

393
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,909
What is that?

394
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,817
Oh, I get it.
It's like toothpaste.

395
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,526
Dad!

396
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:19,201
- So, like, what happened out there?
- Dad!

397
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,904
Hey!

398
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:25,075
- Your leg's messed up. Does it hurt?
- It's okay. Not as bad as it looks.

399
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,219
The mighty huntress returns.

400
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,585
- What's for dinner, honey?
- Not now.

401
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,319
- It was a boar fight?
- Not so much a fight.

402
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,886
It was more, you know,
like me getting gored.

403
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,399
So, where's Mr. Locke?

404
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,231
Uh...

405
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,177
I don't think the hunt went well.
That bald guy never came back.

406
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,477
- They didn't bring back any food?
- Did you hear what I said?

407
00:31:58,549 --> 00:31:59,982
Somebody might have died.

408
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,212
We'll die if somebody
doesn't do something.

409
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,845
There you are.

410
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,221
As promised, you and I will be
dining on fresh catch of the day.

411
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:09,487
- My fish!
- Hope you don't mind alfresco.

412
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,893
It was no problem.
That one gave me a hell of a tussle,

413
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,489
but you have to get inside
the mind of the fish.

414
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,557
- I don't believe you.
- I cornered it.

415
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,900
What's the matter? Can't stand
to see me fending for myself?

416
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,271
- I am so sorry. I apologize.
- What are you apologizing for?

417
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,742
- For using this poor guy.
- Oh, whatever.

418
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,039
In your twisted brain,

419
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,604
you think this proves
you can take care of yourself.

420
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,652
- I told you I'd catch a fish, didn't I?
- That's low, even for you.

421
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,712
Oh, go rescue
a baby bird or something.

422
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,396
Rose, after the sun goes down,

423
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,061
we're gonna burn the fuselage.

424
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,262
It's...

425
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,397
It's just something
that we have to do.

426
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,910
There's gonna be a memorial service
back at the camp for those...

427
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,607
...for those who didn't make it,
for everyone to say goodbye.

428
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:09,848
- I'd like to be there for that.
- Okay.

429
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,486
Maybe if you wanted
to say something,

430
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,398
- You know, about your husband.
- What?

431
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:26,232
I'm saying, if you wanted
to say goodbye to Bernard.

432
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,296
Doctor, my husband is not dead.

433
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:37,145
Rose, he was in the tail
section of the plane.

434
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,807
It broke off in mid-flight.

435
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,046
I'm sorry, but everyone who was
in the rear of the plane is gone.

436
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,190
They're probably thinking
the same thing about us.

437
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,007
Doctor?

438
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,239
You coming?

439
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:28,263
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,823
Guess I should have
gotten the warranty.

441
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,040
I suppose I'll just try again.

442
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,444
Of course, I have no welding iron,
no rivets, scorched wiring,

443
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,675
and it seems I must continue to lie
to anyone who asks me

444
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,512
what I'm actually doing!

445
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,051
Sayid.

446
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,892
We'll try it again.

447
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,967
We'll try it again.

448
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,266
Kate!

449
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,265
Excuse me.

450
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,578
Hey.

451
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,411
You okay?

452
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,178
Is this when you say
"I told you so"?

453
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,422
No. I'm not big on rubbing it in.

454
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,031
Locke, um...

455
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,960
Locke's gone.

456
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:42,104
That thing,
it was moving in his direction.

457
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,664
There wasn't time.

458
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,648
What's going on?

459
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,655
Fuselage is ready to go.

460
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,884
Some of the others decided...

461
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,950
I guess there's gonna be
some words said over the fire.

462
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,019
- That's good.
- Names read, I think.

463
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:11,227
I don't think they're ready
to hear about some things...

464
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,468
Jack?

465
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,165
Jack?

466
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,557
Locke.

467
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:54,136
Judith Martha Wexler

468
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,545
from Denton, Texas.

469
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:03,453
I guess she was gonna
catch a connecting flight.

470
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,459
She wore corrective lenses,

471
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,361
and she was an organ donor.

472
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,557
Or at least would have been.

473
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,230
Steve and Kristen.

474
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:23,740
l-I don't know
their last name, but...

475
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,772
...they were really in love
and were gonna be married.

476
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:34,475
At least wherever they are now,
they're not alone.

477
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,960
...must have had children.

478
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:54,403
<i>A video store receipt lists
overdue charges for Willy Wonka</i>

479
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,305
<i>and The Little Princess. </i>

480
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,579
Looks like he hadn't traveled much,

481
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,673
as far as I can tell
from his passport.

482
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,546
You seen Jack?

483
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:16,619
Seat 23C.

484
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,804
Nice work.

485
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,940
What?

486
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,378
The boar. Nice work, you know.

487
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,385
Killing it.

488
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,115
Just thought
I should say something.

489
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:49,882
So, that thing... the...

490
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,094
...monster, whatever, she said
it was headed right towards you.

491
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,327
Did you see anything?

492
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,392
Get any kind of look at it?

493
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,437
No.

494
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,709
The walkabouts we arrange here are
not just some stroll through the park.

495
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,917
It's trekking across stretches of
desert, rafting treacherous waters...

496
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,186
You've got no idea
who you're talking to.

497
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,785
I'm well aware
of what's involved, believe me.

498
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,127
I probably know more than you.

499
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,362
It's a trying ordeal for someone
in peak physical condition.

500
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,336
I booked this tour a month ago.
You've got my money.

501
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,306
- I demand a place.
- You misrepresented yourself.

502
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,206
- I never lied.
- By omission.

503
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,801
You neglected
to tell us about your condition.

504
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,371
My condition is not an issue.
I've lived with it for four years.

505
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,314
Never kept me from doing anything.

506
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,479
Unfortunately, it is an issue
for our insurance company.

507
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,818
I can't keep the bus waiting.
It isn't fair...

508
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,256
Don't talk to me about fair!

509
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:01,059
I'll get you on a plane to Sydney
on our dime. It's the best I can do.

510
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,100
No, I don't want to
go back to Sydney.

511
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,795
Look, I've been preparing
for this for years.

512
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,236
Just put me on the bus right now.
I can do this!

513
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,172
No, you can't.

514
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,302
Hey, hey, don't you
walk away from me.

515
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:18,781
You don't know who you're dealing with!
Don't ever tell me what I can't do!

516
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,717
This is destiny. This is destiny.
This is my destiny.

517
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,279
Listen, I'm supposed
to do this, damn it!

518
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,723
Don't tell me what I can't do!

519
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,954
Don't tell me what I can't...

520
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,466
Help me! Help!

521
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,848
You! Come on!
Come over here!

522
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,446
Get over here! Give me a hand!

523
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,657
Millicent Louise D'Agostino.

524
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,324
Teaneck, New Jersey.
