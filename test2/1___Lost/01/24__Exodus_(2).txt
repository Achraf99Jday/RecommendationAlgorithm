1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,725
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,212
<i>Mayday, Mayday!</i>

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,716
The French are coming! I've never
been so happy to hear the French.

4
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,719
<i>Does anyone speak French?</i>

5
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,654
I'm alone now.

6
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,486
On the island alone.

7
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,753
Please, someone come.

8
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,756
They're dead.

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,592
It killed them.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,164
It killed them all."

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,864
Guys... where are we?

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,974
I found the wire on the beach.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,808
I thought it might have something to do
with the transmission we picked up.

14
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,975
...with a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 16 years.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,847
Has it really been that long?

16
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,474
You.

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,884
Your people,

18
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,718
the ones you're determined
to get back to.

19
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,019
Watch them closely.

20
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,153
I mean,
I was sleeping, and I woke up,

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,356
and he was trying to hurt my baby!

22
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,367
- We gotta find out who everyone is.
- Wanna start a census?

23
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,768
I interviewed
everyone at the beach. Jack.

24
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,004
One of them isn't in the manifest.

25
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,610
He wasn't on the plane.

26
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,070
We're not the only people
on this island,

27
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,738
and we all know it!

28
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,114
They've attacked us!

29
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:28,143
Sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.

30
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,054
Maybe it's time we started
worrying about them.

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,455
Danielle?

32
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,962
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,794
When I saw black smoke...

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,930
That night, they came.

35
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,264
You have only three choices.

36
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,738
Run.

37
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,544
Hide.

38
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,078
Or die.

39
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,811
All I can tell you
is we do have a plan.

40
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,215
Go into the jungle,
get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,

41
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,150
and then you hide
everyone inside.

42
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,815
God knows how long that
dynamite has been out there.

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,121
So, unless you want to blow up,

44
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,252
I'm coming with you.

45
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,930
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

46
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,827
- See you soon.
- Yes, you will.

47
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,412
Keep it straight.

48
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,945
Go, go!

49
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,491
Bye, Vincent.

50
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,026
- Come on, go.
- Bye, Vincent.

51
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,975
Okay.

52
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,034
Shhh.

53
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,379
Claire. Everybody's leaving.

54
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,352
Well, I can't go anywhere,
all right?

55
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,719
I've got the baby
and I'm... I'm so tired.

56
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,883
I can't... can't carry him.

57
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,723
And now he's wet
and there's sand everywhere.

58
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,787
- I don't have anymore nappies.
- Why don't you let me help?

59
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,800
No, look, nobody ever taught me
how to do this. Okay?

60
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,803
- It's gonna be okay.
- Why do people keep telling me that?

61
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,532
Are they the ones with the baby?

62
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,405
We've got to get there
before sundown.

63
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,671
Once you reach the caves,
stay there.

64
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,270
The rest of us will be
right behind you.

65
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,444
Sayid.

66
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,508
I need a gun.

67
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,113
I know Jack gave 'em to you.

68
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,821
I want one right now.
I have to protect Claire.

69
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,326
Rousseau said the others
won't be here till night.

70
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,828
She's certifiable.
What if they show up before?

71
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,230
- Last time you had a sidearm...
- I killed a murderer. I did us a favor.

72
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,235
You're emotionally involved.
Let me handle the weapons.

73
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,568
You're not here all the time.
You can't protect her. I need a gun.

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,235
If you want to help Claire, get her
packed, carry her child to the caves.

75
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,470
That's what she needs.

76
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,930
How exactly does something
like this happen?

77
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,603
Are you on the same island as I am?

78
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,813
I guess that explains it.

79
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,652
Hold on, wait...
Hold, wait.

80
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,483
What are we,
a couple miles inland?

81
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,115
A tsunami probably
swept it here. Huh? Right?

82
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,823
Hey.

83
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,293
Hey, where are you going?

84
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,694
The explosives are
in the hold of the ship.

85
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,357
Rousseau, wait.

86
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,463
I did what you asked.
You need dynamite.

87
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,063
You don't need me.

88
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,934
Let her go, Jack.

89
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,579
Who's gonna lead us back?

90
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,274
I'll lead us back.

91
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,282
Damn it.

92
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,153
You heard her.
Explosives are in the hold. Let's go.

93
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,492
Hold on. I came here to tell you
how to handle dynamite,

94
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,532
not explore a ghost ship.
You think...

95
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,590
Just... stay out here.

96
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,706
Um...

97
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,470
I'm gonna stay out here
and hang with Arnzt.

98
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,290
Slaves.

99
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,338
This ship must have been
en route to a mining colony.

100
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,972
Probably set off from
the eastern coast of Africa.

101
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,571
Mozambique.

102
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,818
Jack. John. Over here.

103
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,465
...and then my third wife,
she says, get this,

104
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,196
"I didn't sign up for this."

105
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,137
You tell me, what the hell
is that even supposed to mean?

106
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,276
What, am I boring you?

107
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,434
Huh?

108
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,539
You know what? I'm sorry.

109
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,450
I'm sorry that I'm not cool
enough to be part of your

110
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,318
merry little band of adventurers.

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,481
What?

112
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,424
I know a clique when I see it.
I teach high school, pally!

113
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,558
You know, you people think

114
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,758
you're the only ones on
this island doing anything of value.

115
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,425
I got news for you.

116
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,335
There were 40 other survivors
of this plane crash,

117
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,100
and we are all people too.

118
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,677
Okay.

119
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,443
You know what,

120
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,505
I can probably get it
open if I just...

121
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,140
No.
We should take it outside.

122
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,214
Why? You don't
even know if this...

123
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,653
You're not prying open a crate
that says "Explosives" with a pickax.

124
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,787
Yeah, I agree with Jack.

125
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,984
Take it outside, open it there.

126
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,656
Okay.

127
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,197
I got it.

128
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,699
You mind showing us the way?

129
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,002
It's not just the teenagers.
The gym teachers,

130
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,033
you think they let me sit with them
in the cafeteria? No. They do not.

131
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,545
This is all in your head.

132
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,410
Really? You explain
to me why Kate

133
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,007
gets the best pieces
of wreckage for her shelter?

134
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,451
And the Korean guy. Does he catch
fish for everybody on the island?

135
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,386
No. He does not. He doesn't.

136
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,917
And some of us have actually
lost weight while we were here.

137
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,588
You mind telling me
where you're hiding the carbs?

138
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,757
'Cause I can't figure...

139
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,800
What the hell
are you people doing?

140
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,868
Wait, wait. Stop.
Stop right where you are.

141
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,373
Put that down carefully.
Put it down carefully.

142
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,173
Put it gently...
Gently. Damn it!

143
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,077
Carefully, gently. Gently.

144
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,248
Get outta there.
Get away from it. Come on.

145
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,583
- Get out. Move away from it.
- What the hell is your...?

146
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,985
Shh. Be quiet.

147
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,291
Do any of you have any idea

148
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,492
what happens to dynamite
in 90-plus degree heat? Huh?

149
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,531
Do you know?

150
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,326
Any of you?

151
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,699
It sweats nitroglycerin.

152
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,074
What are you doing?
Did I ask you to come closer?

153
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,457
Dynamite...

154
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,162
...is nitroglycerine
stabilized by clay.

155
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,329
Nitroglycerine...

156
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:41,401
...is the most dangerous and unstable
explosive known to man.

157
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,338
Hey Kate, gimme your shirt.

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,246
Now. Princess, give me your shirt.
I need to wrap the dynamite.

159
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,443
Just throw it to me, right here.

160
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,281
Just be careful.
Come on, hurry up.

161
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,753
Okay, good. Now back up.

162
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,313
Back up. Just back up.

163
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,791
Get outta my way.

164
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,259
Any of you ever hear

165
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,797
about the guy
who invented nitroglycerin?

166
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,662
Probably not,

167
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,827
because he blew
his freaking face off.

168
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,201
His lab assistant
came into the room,

169
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,466
saw that his mentor had detonated,

170
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,304
and he said: "Huh.

171
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,378
I guess this stuff does work."

172
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,249
We're not gonna take
more of this stuff than we need,

173
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,121
because nitroglycerine
is extremely temperamental.

174
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,182
So we just...

175
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,830
Dude.

176
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,327
Ahhh!

177
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,609
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- I'm sure you are.

178
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,585
Sir, your bag was unattended.

179
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,047
- Am I free to go?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,317
Good.

181
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,449
I have a plane to catch.

182
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,194
Could you hand me a
paper towel there, bud?

183
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,104
Uh, paper towel,
this one's broken.

184
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,141
- Uh...
- Oh.

185
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,269
Oh. You don't speak English. Sorry.

186
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,395
Dad, look!

187
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,875
How does a place this big
never get discovered?

188
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,814
Don't know.

189
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,783
But you could build yourself one hell
of a beach resort right over there.

190
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,519
Yeah, you build your resort.

191
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,993
I'm happy to say goodbye
to this place forever.

192
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,594
What about everybody else?
Think they'll be okay?

193
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,638
<i>- [Sawyer singing Redemption Song]
- I hope so, buddy.</i>

194
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,933
At least until we can
get 'em some help.

195
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,602
<i>* Redemption songs</i>

196
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,170
<i>* Is all I ever had... </i>

197
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,840
Singing Bob Marley?

198
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,078
No.

199
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,318
Why? You like Bob Marley?

200
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,357
Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?

201
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,241
Damn it!

202
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,012
Do you really need all that?

203
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,411
Yeah. I do.

204
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,449
Why do you have to bring so much?

205
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,177
Don't you have a hike to lead?

206
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,518
I'm fine.

207
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,523
These belonged to your brother.

208
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,532
I need these things.

209
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,298
I can't just leave them.

210
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,200
What are we doing?

211
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,335
Hiding?

212
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,508
As if they won't find us.

213
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,378
It's just...

214
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,049
It's too much.

215
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,715
It's too much.

216
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,458
It won't be too much
if I carry it for you.

217
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,664
Now come on.

218
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,490
I have a hike to lead.

219
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,980
You okay?

220
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,718
That was messed up.

221
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,385
Yeah.

222
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,018
He just...

223
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,229
...exploded...

224
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,864
...in front of us.

225
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,198
He was just trying to help.

226
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,805
This is because I came.

227
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,540
What?

228
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,347
I'm...

229
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,518
...kind of bad luck.

230
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,588
Hey...

231
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,619
It was an accident.

232
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,935
An accident.

233
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,162
Yeah.

234
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,186
Locke.

235
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,291
We should think about this.

236
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,592
All right.

237
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,635
Maybe this isn't the best way.

238
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,869
It's the only way, Jack.

239
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,139
- How many do we need to blow the hatch?
- Two should take care of the hinge.

240
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,375
- Three to be safe.
- Safe.

241
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,987
I'm removing the driest pieces
to minimize our risk transporting it.

242
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:59,060
You ever play Operation?

243
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,028
Sure. "Don't touch the sides."

244
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:07,969
I...

245
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,098
I always...

246
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,110
...got nailed...

247
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,544
...on the funny bone.

248
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,018
Bzzzz!

249
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,192
You like to play games, John?

250
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,765
Absolutely.

251
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,127
Okay.

252
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,640
I know we're in a rush
to escape to the caves,

253
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,200
so I've solved the
Turnip-Head transport issue.

254
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,912
This is, uh, just a blanket
from the plane.

255
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,248
And then, this piece of wood here
that goes through this bamboo.

256
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,047
Here you go.

257
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,912
It's a Björn.

258
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,057
- A Björn?
- Björn. It's...

259
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,552
...Dutch for, uh, baby carrier.

260
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,189
Yeah. Thanks.

261
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,063
- Well, that's okay.
- Thank you.

262
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,225
- Thanks.
- Oh! That's okay.

263
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,361
Let's put him there.

264
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,234
- It's really...
- Sayid!

265
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,500
- Where is he?
- What...?

266
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,142
- Sayid, where is he?
- He already left.

267
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,769
- I need him now!
- Jack and Kate?

268
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,541
There's no time!
Where is Sayid?

269
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,242
All right, just calm down.
I'll get him for you.

270
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,716
- Stay here, all right?
- Okay.

271
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,775
That's okay.

272
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,149
Sayid! Sayid!

273
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,492
What happened out there?

274
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,293
What is his name?

275
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,057
Your child.

276
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,535
What is his name?

277
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,963
Oh, I haven't named him yet.

278
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,733
May I hold him?

279
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,241
Um, why do you need Sayid?

280
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,914
You don't want me to hold him?

281
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,017
No, I just fed him.
I don't think it's a good idea. Okay?

282
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,022
Please!

283
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,369
When did I do that?

284
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,341
Why did I scratch you?

285
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,440
- What's going on?
- Uh...

286
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,545
My flight. L, uh...

287
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,912
My flight to LA
leaves in a couple of hours,

288
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:08,942
so you gotta get moving,
you know? Uh...

289
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,647
You wanna do one more bump
for the road?

290
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,990
It's all gone.

291
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,461
We did it all last night.
I got some champagne.

292
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,761
- You gotta have some left.
- Mm-mm.

293
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,961
Nope. It's done.

294
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,402
I'll look you up next time
I'm in Sydney, okay.

295
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,906
I'll, uh, send you an
autographed copy of, uh, my CD,

296
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,604
then you can listen
when you want.

297
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,613
I don't want your crap CD
from your crap band.

298
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,945
Last night in the bar,
you said you were a fan.

299
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,485
Fine. I'm a huge fan.

300
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,454
Drive Thru is the
best damn band ever.

301
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,815
Now just gimme a bump,
'cause I know you got some.

302
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,762
Shaft. Drive Shaft.

303
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,398
What's that in your hand?

304
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,365
Nothing.

305
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,805
- Holding out on me?
- I'm not holding out.

306
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:03,966
- Give it to me.
- What?

307
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:05,600
- I'm not holding.
- Give it.

308
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,975
I got nothing in my hand!
Get off!

309
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,338
Get up!

310
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,212
- Get off!
- Get up! Let it go. Let it go!

311
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,912
- What are you, crazy?
- Let it go!

312
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,181
- Get off!
- Let it go!

313
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,821
Get off! Get off me!

314
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,823
Ow!

315
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,460
You're pathetic.

316
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,297
You're pathetic!

317
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,347
Sayid! Sayid!

318
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,546
Rousseau's on the beach.
She needs you.

319
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,817
- Rousseau? What for?
- I don't know.

320
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,291
Help! Help!

321
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,091
Help! Someone! Help!

322
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,528
- Oh, my God.
- Help!

323
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,862
- What happened?
- Her head.

324
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,835
- Where's my baby?
- Oh, my God.

325
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:06,561
Is he all right?

326
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,669
- Rousseau. Was she alone?
- Did she take my baby?

327
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,970
Which way did she go?

328
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,376
I don't know!
She took my baby!

329
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,639
This is your fault!
You brought her into the camp!

330
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,877
If you had given me a gun...

331
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,586
Do not hit me again.

332
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,785
You want to waste time
assigning blame?

333
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,620
There's plenty to go around.

334
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,922
She has a head start.
If we leave now, we can catch her.

335
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,327
How we gonna do that?

336
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,331
Because I know where she's going.

337
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,498
- Please now...
- I want my baby.

338
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,210
I can carry
all the sticks in my pack.

339
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,080
The more insulation we stuff in,
the better.

340
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,210
I think we should split 'em up.

341
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,976
What?

342
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,218
It's not smart to keep it all together,
so we split 'em up.

343
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,453
If we need three sticks
to blow the hinge,

344
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,858
then we should bring six.

345
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,323
Three and three.

346
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,128
A fail-safe.
In case one of us...

347
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,327
You and me then.

348
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,370
No. I'm taking one.

349
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,365
Not gonna happen.

350
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,602
This is why I came.

351
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,702
- You wasted a trip.
- I need to do this.

352
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,339
Kate, no one owes
anyone anything.

353
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,076
- I'm carrying one.
- We're done.

354
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,913
- This is not your decision.
- It is.

355
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,452
We'll draw straws.

356
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:34,184
They're coming. We don't have time to
argue about who risks their life, so...

357
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,521
...we let fate decide.
- Works for me.

358
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,993
- What about you?
- You wanna carry some dynamite?

359
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,493
What?

360
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,507
You got some... Arnzt on you.

361
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,885
Short sticks carry the packs.

362
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,295
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

363
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,807
So, what's this stuff even do?

364
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,611
Well, the transmitter
sends out an SOS

365
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,379
in case someone's listening.

366
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,011
And if there's anything out there,

367
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,318
we'll see it on this
radar screen here.

368
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,426
Here we go.

369
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,092
Come on.

370
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,297
Someone, find us.

371
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,770
Those are messages
everybody wrote.

372
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,610
Sure are.

373
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,707
They're private.

374
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,012
Yep.

375
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,619
I for one never knew
how much Tracey

376
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,284
missed her hubby
and two kids back in Fresno.

377
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,493
Yet she's sleeping
next to good ol' Scott

378
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,052
to keep her warm at night.

379
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,256
That's Steve. Scott's dead.

380
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,822
Whatever.

381
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,132
Long ride, Kazoo.
We gotta keep ourselves entertained.

382
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,930
Who the hell is Hugo
and how's he got

383
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,805
a hundred and sixty million dollars
to leave to his mom?

384
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,810
How'd you like it if I read yours?

385
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,505
You can't 'cause I didn't write one.

386
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,705
Why not?

387
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,480
'Cause the only letter I ever wrote
is to the man I'm gonna kill.

388
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,989
- Why you gonna kill him?
- 'Cause I need to.

389
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,185
- Why?
- Because.

390
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,064
Are you bloody joking?

391
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,595
Why would she go for the black smoke?
Isn't that where the others are?

392
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,733
The others are why
she would go there.

393
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,010
Rousseau told us
she saw black smoke

394
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,478
the day her own child
was taken 16 years ago.

395
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,541
They took something from her.

396
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:16,576
And now she believes...
she has something they want.

397
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,214
- She's making a trade?
- I believe she is. Yes.

398
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,452
That's insane. She's insane.

399
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,293
Don't apply reason to her actions.
She's a mother who lost her child.

400
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,388
Just like Claire.

401
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,736
This isn't about revenge.

402
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,668
Don't make it personal.

403
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,404
I'm coming with you.

404
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,742
That's not a good idea.

405
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,409
This is my baby, okay.
I let her take him.

406
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,112
- Claire, listen.
- Don't tell me what to do!

407
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,279
Calm down.

408
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,381
I am coming with you.
This is my fault and I'm coming

409
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,652
and you can't stop me!

410
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,427
It's fine, all right.
It's all right.

411
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,429
I'm supposed to raise him.

412
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,467
Get him back, Charlie.

413
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,605
Get Aaron back.

414
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,239
Aaron?

415
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,606
Please.

416
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,205
Get him back. Please.

417
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,616
Claire, I will get him back.

418
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,914
Promise.

419
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,369
Hey, you want something to eat?

420
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,810
I guess that's a "no" then.

421
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,126
If you're worried about Vincent,
he's gonna be okay, man.

422
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,097
Dogs fly in the luggage compartment
all the time.

423
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,327
All right.

424
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,569
I gotta call work.

425
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,676
Right over there.

426
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,308
Don't go anywhere, okay?

427
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,581
No, I live in a studio apartment.

428
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,557
I gotta be out the door
in the morning for work by 5am.

429
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,084
Who's gonna watch him? How's he
getting to school? What about after?

430
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,221
I can't do this, Ma.

431
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,691
You know, I was...

432
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,233
Listen, I was thinking, um...

433
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,032
I was thinking maybe
you could take him.

434
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,240
But Ma,
if it's a question of money, I...

435
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,186
What am I supposed to do with him?
He's not supposed to be mine.

436
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,521
This was never part of the plan.

437
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,364
Yeah, I...

438
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,803
Thanks, Ma.

439
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,482
Hey, man.

440
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,821
- I was, uh...
- I need new batteries.

441
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,529
Hey.

442
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,827
- You wanna try?
- What?

443
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,889
Come on, come here.

444
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,300
- You drive for awhile.
- Really?

445
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,804
Absolutely.
Okay, now. Look.

446
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,432
The most important part
of this boat is the rudder.

447
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,873
It's how you steer.

448
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,776
You turn it gradually.
Nothing sharp, okay?

449
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,279
Push it this way.

450
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,046
Where are we going?

451
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,211
Look.

452
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,783
So we're going approximately
north by northeast.

453
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,622
So hopefully that puts us
into a shipping lane.

454
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,955
Or we hit some land.

455
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,654
What do I aim for?

456
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,463
See that cloud on the horizon?

457
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,002
- Right there?
- Yeah.

458
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,969
You aim for that.

459
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,496
Yep.

460
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,270
- Okay.
- Got it.

461
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,246
How come you and my mom
didn't stay together?

462
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,951
We tried.

463
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,322
It just didn't work out.
So our lives, our interests

464
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,692
just went in different directions.

465
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,031
How come I never saw you?

466
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,066
'Cause your mom didn't want me to.

467
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,036
She did what she thought was best.

468
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,310
She was wrong.

469
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,918
- Rudder.
- Hey, we hit a log.

470
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,422
- We lost the rudder.
- Rudder. Rudder.

471
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,084
We're losing it!
It's sinking! Stop the boat.

472
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,656
Stop the boat!
Just pull the sail down.

473
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,524
Right.

474
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,161
Dad!

475
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,499
Sawyer!

476
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,802
Sawyer!
Give me the rope. Throw it.

477
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,886
- Sawyer!
- It's sinking.

478
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,822
I can't reach it.

479
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,710
Got it?

480
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,269
Tie it around the rudder
and we'll pull you in!

481
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,676
Okay.

482
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,862
Michael. Michael.

483
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,592
Got it. Come on.

484
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,396
Come on, buddy.

485
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,075
You just saved our ass, buddy.

486
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,011
Here's your shirt.

487
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,020
You should put that
back on before you burn.

488
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,798
Sorry.

489
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,742
Yeah, well...

490
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,606
It's the luck of the draw.

491
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,681
Sun sets in 90 minutes,
give or take.

492
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,378
If we want to get back
to the hatch, we have to hustle.

493
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,579
Okay, this is how we do this.

494
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,123
I'll lead.
Kate, you're right behind me.

495
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,625
Then Hurley.
John, you bring up the rear.

496
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,390
- If you see me heading the wrong way...
- We should stagger our formation.

497
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,328
Keep a safe distance
from each other.

498
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,460
All right. We stagger.

499
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,302
If anyone hears
anything or sees anything...

500
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,999
Like the security system
that eats people?

501
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,406
Yeah. Like that.

502
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,570
You two, you take your packs off,
you put 'em down and you run.

503
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,477
- You got it?
- Got it.

504
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,742
Yes, sir.

505
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,414
Okay.

506
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,148
Let's do this.

507
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,102
He died bravely.

508
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,102
What?

509
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,639
Your brother.

510
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,350
Yeah.

511
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,346
Thanks.

512
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,690
Do you think all this...

513
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,525
...all we've been through...?

514
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,060
Do you think
we're being punished?

515
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,372
Punished for what?

516
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,944
Things we did before.

517
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,206
The secrets we kept.

518
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,586
The lies we told.

519
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,892
Who do you think
is punishing us?

520
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,792
Fate.

521
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,834
No one's punishing us.

522
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,832
No such thing as fate.

523
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,079
Are you okay?

524
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,416
I'm fine. Keep going.

525
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,723
We're losing the light.

526
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,563
- Try to keep up.
- I'm coming.

527
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,578
Sayid!

528
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,686
Sayid!

529
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:01,128
Sayid!

530
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:02,988
Over here.

531
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,034
Sayid.

532
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,505
You can barely breathe.
We're going to rest.

533
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,269
Rest?
She's out there right now.

534
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,109
In another mile, you're going to
collapse. We're going to take a break.

535
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,044
Is this where Boone fell?

536
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,746
The plane was up there.

537
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,984
Where did it come from?

538
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,561
Based on the maps inside, Nigeria.

539
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:39,462
- Anyone onboard?
- Two men, dressed as priests.

540
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,465
- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

541
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,410
The plane was loaded with heroin.

542
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,249
All right.

543
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,722
Now we go.

544
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:01,651
So, dude, what do you
think's inside that hatch thing?

545
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,677
What do you
think's inside it?

546
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,881
Stacks of TV dinners

547
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,983
from the fifties or something.

548
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,292
And TVs with cable.

549
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,093
Some cell phones.

550
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,066
Clean socks. Soap.

551
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,801
Twinkies.

552
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,862
You know,
for dessert after the TV dinners.

553
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,738
Twinkies keep for,
like, 8,000 years, man.

554
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,673
I like Twinkies too.

555
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,580
Come on, really.
What do you think's inside?

556
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,012
Hope.

557
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,049
I think hope's inside.

558
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:18,422
Whoever named this place
Dark Territory,

559
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,258
genius.

560
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,346
Yeah. I saw it.

561
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,522
We gotta get out of here.

562
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,715
Locke! What are you doing?

563
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:37,362
Locke!

564
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,719
Locke!

565
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,573
Locke! Locke!

566
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:20,944
Jack?

567
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,819
Jack!

568
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,922
Ahhh!

569
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,124
Locke!

570
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:39,727
Ahh!

571
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,412
- Oh, my God. Locke!
- I need the dynamite!

572
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,979
No, no. It's in my pack.

573
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,316
Go get it! Hurry! Go!

574
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:05,223
- John. John, just hold on.
- Oh!

575
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,957
- Just let me go.
- What?

576
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,897
- I'll be all right.
- No!

577
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,663
- Let me go! I'll be all right.
- I got it! I got it!

578
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,063
Be careful unwrapping it.

579
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,904
All right.

580
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,965
- Now throw it in.
- No! Lt'll blow us up.

581
00:46:19,043 --> 00:46:21,375
- Do it! Hurry! I can't hold him.
- Don't do this.

582
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,006
- Throw it in. Now, Kate!
- Ah!

583
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,156
Hey.

584
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,196
Your wife... wife made this for you?

585
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,636
Sun.

586
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,434
She sounded it out, huh?

587
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,601
- So you can learn English.
- Uh... Yes.

588
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,407
Yeah, I wish she made one for me.

589
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,014
So, what words are in here?

590
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,784
English words.
What can you say?

591
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,413
Ah! Um...

592
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:40,852
Starboard.

593
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,522
Aft. Port.

594
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,166
Uh... Sail.

595
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,358
Uh...

596
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,562
- Eat.
- Yeah, right.

597
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,399
She did you well.

598
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:56,701
I hope you know
how lucky you are, man.

599
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:03,745
Back in business?

600
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,350
Alrighty.

601
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,253
Oh, hey,

602
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,350
it's yours.

603
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:27,032
- Here we are.
- You.

604
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:28,935
What?

605
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,068
You.

606
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,713
Um...

607
00:48:41,552 --> 00:48:45,249
Thank... you. Thanks.

608
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,505
I made you some tea.

609
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,869
I'm fine.

610
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:12,738
Thanks.

611
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,954
Aaron is a beautiful name.

612
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,288
What does it mean?

613
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,992
I don't know what Aaron means.

614
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,765
- They will bring him back.
- Don't say that.

615
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,571
- They will.
- How do you know that?

616
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,135
Because he said he would.

617
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:49,078
Charlie will bring
your baby back.

618
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,902
- There!
- Charlie, wait!

619
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,372
Charlie!

620
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,336
Ah!

621
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,940
See. Let me see.

622
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,883
- It's bleeding.
- We need to put pressure on it.

623
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:23,681
Okay. Put pressure.

624
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,384
- Ow!
- There.

625
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:30,825
- Animal! What is she...? Ow!
- Keep the pressure on, like this!

626
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:34,352
She's been here for 16 years.
She's learned how to set traps quickly.

627
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,991
Okay, let's have a look.
It's too deep.

628
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,729
It's bleeding too much.
You have to go back.

629
00:50:39,803 --> 00:50:41,202
I'm not. You have to fix it.

630
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,205
- I'm not a doctor.
- You're a soldier!

631
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,503
What do people do
when they get wounded?

632
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:48,670
I'm not going back
without that baby, Sayid.

633
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,517
Don't move.

634
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,599
- Gunpowder?
- Remove the towel, tilt your head back.

635
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,804
Remove the towel.

636
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,774
This is because I hit you, isn't it?

637
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,616
This is not going to be pleasant.

638
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:33,779
You ready?

639
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,961
One. Two. Three.

640
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,991
Oh, man.

641
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,999
I need my car.

642
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,433
Twenty minutes?
Look, I can't miss my flight.

643
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:21,164
My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

644
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,707
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on. Cool.

645
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,720
Some of us have
a bloody flight to make.

646
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:46,594
Excuse me. Coming through.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

647
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,354
Excuse me.

648
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,428
Come on. Come on.

649
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,203
No. No. No!

650
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,638
No!

651
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,495
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out. Coming through.

652
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,695
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Look out! Excuse me.

653
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:37,311
<i>Flight 917 is now
boarding at gate 85.</i>

654
00:53:38,315 --> 00:53:42,046
<i>Flight 917 is now
boarding at gate 85.</i>

655
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:45,546
Any way we can hurry that up?
My mom's birthday's tomorrow.

656
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:49,854
Or... today. I don't know, I don't
really get the whole time change thing,

657
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,417
but I gotta make that flight.

658
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:54,692
I am going as fast
as the system will allow me, dear.

659
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:57,029
You are confirmed for seat 20-G.

660
00:53:57,668 --> 00:54:01,104
However, the airline has
a policy that a man of your size

661
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,604
must purchase two tickets.

662
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,839
What? I didn't have
to do that on the flight out here.

663
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,208
Am I going to have
to weigh you, dear?

664
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:14,108
Fine. Whatever.
I'll buy the one next to it.

665
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,452
- Alrighty. Here's two together.
- Book it.

666
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:23,190
<i>Departure gate
for flight 143 has been changed... </i>

667
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,727
Uh-oh.

668
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,092
"Uh-oh"? What "uh-oh"?

669
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,723
It appears that your flight
is already boarding

670
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:32,758
in the international terminal.
This is the domestic terminal.

671
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,164
I don't think you're meant
to make this flight, dear.

672
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,781
Sorry. Pardon me.

673
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,653
Excuse me. Sorry.

674
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,489
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

675
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,695
Excuse me! Coming through.
Behind you. Look out!

676
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,325
Excuse me. Excuse me.

677
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:11,135
Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry! Sorry,
this is an emergency. I gotta...

678
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:14,575
I gotta cut through.
Excuse me. Dude. Dude.

679
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,512
- Back of the line.
- Let me go ahead. I'm gonna miss my...

680
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,948
- You don't understand. This is...
- Back of the line.

681
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,316
Next.

682
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,788
Now? You're taking
the computer out now?

683
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,499
Hey! Old guy!

684
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,765
I'll give you 500
to borrow your scooter.

685
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,002
I just had a hip replacement.
I need this.

686
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:51,012
Okay. Sixteen hundred bucks.

687
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,920
Excuse me. Excuse me.

688
00:55:57,988 --> 00:56:00,183
Whoa! Coming through! Look out.

689
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,589
Look out, look out.
Coming through.

690
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,956
Excuse me. Excuse me.

691
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,495
Look out. Heads up.
Coming through. Look out.

692
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:08,588
Coming through. Coming through.

693
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:09,962
<i>Konnichiwa.  Excuse me.</i>

694
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,500
Yeah, coming through.

695
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:21,706
Look out! Look out! Hey! Hold it!

696
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,939
Hold the door! Hold the door!

697
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,217
Hold... Hold the door!

698
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,688
I gotta get on... this flight!

699
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,091
- Sir, the Jetway's closed.
- Please.

700
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,857
For the love of all that is
good and holy in the world,

701
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,922
let me on this plane.

702
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,030
All right, one second.

703
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:52,705
Hunter? This is Gina.
We've got one more.

704
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,570
Ta.

705
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:00,311
This is your lucky day.

706
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,796
Fifteen, 16, 23, 42, four.

707
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,409
You say something?

708
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,036
Nope.

709
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,879
I thought I heard 23.

710
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,010
Does that mean something to you?

711
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,851
- What?
- That number? 23?

712
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,357
The guy who called the feds on me
back in Australia

713
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,625
did it for a $23,000 reward.

714
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,030
Mean something to you?

715
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,965
Nah. It's just a number.

716
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,168
Better catch up.
I can barely see 'em.

717
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,650
We shouldn't be this close
to each other, Jack.

718
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:19,718
If we blow up, we blow up.

719
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,864
What the hell was all that
about back there?

720
00:58:23,934 --> 00:58:26,266
- What was what about?
- You asked to let you go.

721
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,325
That's right.

722
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:29,338
That thing was
taking you down the hole.

723
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:31,738
- It wasn't gonna hurt me.
- It was gonna kill you.

724
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,969
I seriously doubt that.

725
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,168
Look, I need for you to...

726
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,807
I need for you to explain to me what
the hell's going on inside your head.

727
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,613
I need to know why you believe
that thing wasn't gonna...

728
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,452
- I believe that I was being tested.
- Tested.

729
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,650
Yeah. Tested.

730
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,660
I think that's why you and I
don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

731
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,722
- Because you're a man of science.
- Yeah.

732
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,428
- And what does that make you?
- Me?

733
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,663
Well, I'm a man of faith.

734
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,637
Do you really think
all this is an accident?

735
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,705
That we, a group of strangers,
survived.

736
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,147
Many of us with
just superficial injuries.

737
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:19,018
You think we crashed on this place
by coincidence? Especially this place.

738
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,991
We were brought here for a purpose.
For a reason. All of us.

739
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:27,052
Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

740
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,157
Brought here?

741
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,168
And who brought us here, John?

742
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,362
The island.

743
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,304
The island brought us here.

744
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,034
This is no ordinary place.
You've seen that, I know you have.

745
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,241
The island chose you too, Jack.

746
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,013
It's destiny.

747
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,217
Did you talk with Boone
about destiny, John?

748
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:01,288
Boone was a sacrifice
that the island demanded.

749
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,171
What happened to him at that plane
was a part of a chain of events

750
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,834
that led us here,
that led us down a path,

751
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,640
that led you and me to this day,
to right now.

752
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,445
And where's that path end, John?

753
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,749
The path ends at the hatch.

754
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:29,085
The hatch, Jack. All of it. All of it
happened so we can open the hatch.

755
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,595
No. No, we're opening the hatch
so that we can survive.

756
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,665
Survival is all relative, Jack.

757
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,040
I don't believe in destiny.

758
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,936
Yes, you do.

759
01:00:51,915 --> 01:00:54,281
You just don't know it yet.

760
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:20,107
- I turned it on a little while ago.
- Sayid said every hour.

761
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:24,442
Look, we're 15 miles out.
We could be here for weeks.

762
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:28,041
- If that battery runs out...
- The man said every hour.

763
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:37,487
- Nothing.
- Five minutes. No more.

764
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,260
Aye, aye.

765
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,461
Know what I like about you, Mike?

766
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,228
You got the patience of a saint.

767
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,326
Yeah? Why you say that?

768
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,339
I've seen the way he talks to you.

769
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:54,774
The way he runs around,
does whatever the hell he wants.

770
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,711
I'd have shown him
the back of my hand a long time ago.

771
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:02,946
- You would, huh?
- Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

772
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,080
Is that what your father did to you?
Show you the back of his hand?

773
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:10,752
My daddy never got
a chance to beat me.

774
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:12,522
Shot himself when I was eight.

775
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,198
That why you wanna die?

776
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:20,693
What?

777
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:24,262
Since you told me you wanted
on this raft, I couldn't figure it out.

778
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,100
Why's a guy who
only cares about himself

779
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:29,975
wanna risk his life
to save everyone else?

780
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,646
Way I see it,
there's only two choices.

781
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:39,946
You're either a hero,
or you wanna die.

782
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,593
Well...

783
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:48,028
I ain't no hero, Mike.

784
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,907
That what I think it is?

785
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,671
Something's out there.

786
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:35,640
I'm sorry, sir, but the
special wheelchair that we use

787
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:39,671
for loading disabled passengers, no one
seems to know where it is right now,

788
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:43,185
and unless we find it,
I'm not sure we can get you on.

789
01:03:43,253 --> 01:03:45,414
There's not another flight
till tomorrow.

790
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,683
I'm aware,
but there's nothing I can do.

791
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,920
Look, I can get Michelle.
We can carry him on.

792
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,484
Mind if we carry you on?

793
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,490
No, that would be fine.

794
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,168
Here we go.

795
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,336
Here's your seat.

796
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,043
I'll get your bags, sir.

797
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:17,518
If you need anything,
press the "call" button.

798
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:20,613
Okay. Thank you.

799
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:22,116
Hugo,

800
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,915
take these extra sticks
back a couple hundred yards.

801
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:26,546
Me?

802
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,857
Oh, okay. Got it.

803
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,063
Be careful.

804
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,232
Can I have a flashlight?

805
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:44,171
'Cause, uh, the torch around the
dynamite thing, not making sense to me.

806
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,806
Kate, you run the fuse.

807
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:55,442
- Jack and I will rig the charges.
- Okay.

808
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,416
What the hell is that?

809
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,590
There's no footprints, no tracks.

810
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,527
This is it?
This is the black smoke?

811
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:48,396
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

812
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,640
She's here.

813
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,449
Danielle?

814
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:06,844
- You come out! Right now!
- Calm down.

815
01:07:10,293 --> 01:07:14,252
Danielle, I can hear you.
Come out.

816
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,656
Please. He needs his mother.

817
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,904
- They were not here.
- Danielle,

818
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,876
you have to give us the baby.

819
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:38,580
I just wanted my Alex back.

820
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:45,317
I thought if I gave them the baby...

821
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,632
It's okay. I know.

822
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,422
It's okay.

823
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,599
I got him.

824
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,202
There never were any others.

825
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,472
You started the fires yourself!

826
01:08:37,013 --> 01:08:40,471
No. I heard them whispering.

827
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,950
You're a nut job.
You heard nothing.

828
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,944
I heard them say
they were coming for the child.

829
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:52,157
The others said
they were coming for the boy.

830
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,299
You're pathetic.

831
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:23,718
Wire.

832
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,331
Hold that end.

833
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:50,878
Now the fuse.

834
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:03,859
I'll do it.

835
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,494
- That's as far as it goes.
- It's far enough.

836
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,903
I'll light it. You take cover.

837
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,965
There'll be enough
burn time for me to get clear.

838
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,707
- Hurley!
- Wait. Just a sec.

839
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,581
What was that
about back there?

840
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,789
What was what about?

841
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:09,092
Putting the dynamite in your pack.

842
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:12,692
- I made a judgment call.
- We drew straws.

843
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,760
I'm not gonna let drawing straws
make decisions like that.

844
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,203
You had no right.

845
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,709
Everybody wants me to be a leader
till I make a decision they don't like.

846
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,540
You want to keep second guessing me?
That's your call.

847
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,278
There's something you need to know.

848
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,544
If we survive this,
if we survive tonight...

849
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,421
...we're gonna
have a Locke problem.

850
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,725
And I have to know
that you've got my back.

851
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,424
I got your back.

852
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,996
Are we ready?

853
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,132
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

854
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,852
No, no, no.

855
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,763
Stop! Stop, we can't do this.

856
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:21,498
Stop! Wait!
Stop! We can't do this!

857
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:25,028
Stop it! Stop it! We can't!

858
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,667
Stop, don't light it!
We can't do this!

859
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:30,576
We can't do this!
Stop! What are you...?

860
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,477
We gotta stop it.
The numbers are bad.

861
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,746
What are you doing?
Why'd you do that?

862
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,149
Wait! The numbers are bad!
The numbers are bad!

863
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,020
- The numbers are bad!
- Stop!

864
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,957
- No, we can't!
- Hurley!

865
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,892
- Get back!
- We can't. The numbers...

866
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,021
You gotta get back.
You gotta get back.

867
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:11,553
It's closer.
Give me the damn flare gun.

868
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,679
- Hold on.
- It's closer. I'm telling you.

869
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,816
I know, okay.
I've got one flare. One flare.

870
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,792
Okay. I know.
You don't see anything.

871
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:22,524
What the hell are you expecting?
In case you haven't noticed, it's dark.

872
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,567
- What is it? Is it a ship?
- We don't know, little man.

873
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,931
Starboard? Port?

874
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,766
Uh... Port. Port.

875
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,873
What the hell am I supposed to do?

876
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,570
Han. You and Chewie
wanna slow down and talk to me?

877
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:38,807
- We have to fire the flare.
- We don't know what it is.

878
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,373
It could be anything. Junk.
We don't know if Sayid's radar works.

879
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:45,352
- He ever fix something that don't?
- It's moving away.

880
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,618
- Junk knows how to steer?
- We're moving. It doesn't mean...

881
01:13:52,695 --> 01:13:55,926
Are you gonna give me the damn
gun or am I gonna have to take it?

882
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,056
What're you gonna do?
Shoot me?

883
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,463
It's almost gone!

884
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,980
Come on!

885
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,356
Please, God!

886
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,148
It's coming back!
It's coming back!

887
01:14:57,359 --> 01:14:59,759
- Yes!
- Hell, yeah. Okay?

888
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,797
All right. Okay. I know it.

889
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,593
Shh!

890
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,252
Ahoy!

891
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,655
Oh, man,
are we glad to see you.

892
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,860
What's going on? What are
you folks doing this far out here?

893
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:14,425
We were... we were
in the plane crash!

894
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:17,097
We've been on an island
for a month, man.

895
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:20,699
Plane crash, huh?
Well, how about that!

896
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:25,076
We were on an island... flight 815...
Hey, where are we?

897
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:27,581
Hey, it's a good thing
we found you!

898
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:31,177
We survived, and there's
a whole group of people on the island.

899
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,518
- Well, ain't that something.
- Yeah.

900
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,282
Only, the thing is,

901
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,623
we're gonna have to take the boy.

902
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,094
What? What'd you say?

903
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:46,692
The boy.
We're gonna have to take him.

904
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:00,805
Hey, what the hell's going on here?
Who are you people?

905
01:17:00,883 --> 01:17:03,078
Just give us the boy.

906
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,888
I'm not giving you anybody.

907
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,798
Well, all right then.

908
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,126
No!

909
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:27,334
- Dad! Dad!
- No! Walt, no!

910
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,981
Dad, help!

911
01:17:42,925 --> 01:17:47,294
- Walt!
- Dad, please. Help, Dad. Help me.

912
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:48,853
Dad!

913
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,638
Walt!

914
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,543
Help me, Dad! Please!

915
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,776
Walt! Walt!

916
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:16,419
Walt! No!
