1
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,220
There they go again.

2
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:46,492
- You think we should do something?
- What should we do?

3
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,332
What's going on?

4
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:52,701
I don't know. He walked up
and started going off on her again.

5
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:54,904
Hey.

6
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,067
Hey, hey, hey! Jin!

7
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,006
Get your hands off her!

8
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,813
I swear to God, you put your
hands on her one more time...

9
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,182
Get your hands off me!

10
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,460
Michael?

11
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,062
I'm sorry.

12
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,066
Don't worry.

13
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,836
I stuck my nose
where it didn't belong.

14
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,244
It's on me.

15
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,872
You must understand.

16
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,576
I got to get this raft finished

17
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,551
so I can get my boy
and take him home.

18
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,589
When I slapped you,
I was protecting you.

19
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,590
- Yeah? From what?
- From Jin.

20
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,453
You don't know
what he's capable of.

21
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,423
It's not my problem. It's yours.

22
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,619
Why don't you try sea urchin?

23
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,783
They got more ping.

24
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,190
Hey.

25
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,964
I know things got kind of nasty
down there at the beach.

26
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:54,666
I don't want to get involved
in husband and wife stuff,

27
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,072
but I figured, you know,

28
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,338
you might need to relax.

29
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,370
So...

30
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,721
Come on, dude, I'm trying here.

31
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,190
OK.

32
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,661
You want to be an outsider?
It's your business.

33
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,738
I tied this side down.

34
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,640
Do you think
this is gonna hold?

35
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,841
Do you have a past in the Navy
you've neglected to tell me about?

36
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,076
- Why?
- How does a woman like you

37
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,175
learn how to tie
a perfect bowline knot?

38
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,483
By dating guys with sailboats.

39
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,085
Since you bring it up, I've been
worried since I first met you

40
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,822
that you might end up a spinster.

41
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,126
Spending my Saturday nights
alone at home tying knots?

42
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,998
Perhaps with an overweight aunt.

43
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,903
It's a very sad image.

44
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,109
Maybe we should get some rope,
spend a Saturday night alone together,

45
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,907
and see what happens.

46
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,152
Dad?

47
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,989
Thanks.

48
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,353
You are gonna love New York, Walt.
No city like it.

49
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,023
What I really want to show you

50
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,761
- Are the buildings, architecture.
- Buildings?

51
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,201
I said that,
'til I saw the Flatiron Building.

52
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,967
- What's that?
- Oldest skyscraper in the city.

53
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,269
Built in 1902.

54
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,106
And it's flat.
That one building inspired me

55
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:41,169
to start drawing
and designing things.

56
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,408
- Why?
- You just gotta see it.

57
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,110
- You want to see it, right?
- I guess.

58
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,551
Can I go throw the ball to Vincent?

59
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,981
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

60
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,661
Come on, Vincent!

61
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,822
Wow, you're making
a lot of progress.

62
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,129
- Yeah, trying.
- It's pretty cool.

63
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:05,302
Got this bamboo for the decking,

64
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,000
got a piece of the fuselage
for a cabin.

65
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,937
Some storage bins.

66
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,812
What's up?

67
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,041
I thought I'd give you the heads-up.

68
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,344
Yeah?

69
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,944
There's a lot of talk going on about
who's going on this thing with you.

70
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,620
<i>Hey, man,
it's not the Queen Mary. </i>

71
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,218
I only got room for four people.

72
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,728
There's one open spot.

73
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,661
Who took the other one?

74
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,791
What's the matter, doc?

75
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,835
Feeling left out?

76
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,638
- You're taking Sawyer with you?
- Yep.

77
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,674
Bought myself a ticket
on this little tub.

78
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,109
Let me tell you,
the fare was steep.

79
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,841
Could have used that cable
to hold up my new beach house.

80
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,610
You sold him a spot?

81
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,152
I needed halyards for the mast.

82
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,986
Good thing I'm a saver,
not a spender, huh, Doc?

83
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,156
How much longer are you gonna
let him treat you this way?

84
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,367
- Please...
- Sun.

85
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,266
He's my husband.

86
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,206
A husband you're afraid to tell
you speak English.

87
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,608
I'm trying to understand, Sun.

88
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,208
He wasn't always like this.

89
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:28,815
He used to tell me
how beautiful I looked to him.

90
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,656
He was so tender.

91
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,529
And then he was different.

92
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,567
What changed him?

93
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,234
Need some help!

94
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,039
Hey, Charlie, what's going on?

95
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,343
The raft, it's on fire. Look.

96
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,701
No! No!

97
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
No!

98
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,774
Where is he?

99
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,276
Where the hell is he?

100
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,419
Where is he?

101
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,528
- Where is he?
- She doesn't understand.

102
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,565
- Hey! Where is he?
- Back off.

103
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,327
Her husband did this.
She knows!

104
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,027
You trying to protect him now?

105
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,093
- She was with me!
- No, Walt!

106
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,230
Get back.

107
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,103
- No, it's done.
- Sun, wait!

108
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,938
I'm gonna break his damn neck!

109
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,537
- Just take it easy, man.
- We don't know that Jin did this.

110
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,878
- Are you serious?
- Sawyer, shut up!

111
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,316
- We saw him on the beach.
- That doesn't mean he torched the raft.

112
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,785
Yeah, then who did, Jack?

113
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,244
What do you want?

114
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,720
I'd like to talk to you
about Shannon.

115
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,893
It's very possible your sister and I

116
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,488
are going to become
more than just friends.

117
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,696
What is this,

118
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,663
some Middle Eastern thing?

119
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,230
You want my blessing
or something?

120
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,401
- My hope is you won't object.
- Yeah?

121
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,877
I was extending a courtesy,
not asking your permission.

122
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,615
Let me tell you about my sister.

123
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,759
She likes older men,
guys who can take care of her.

124
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,731
My guess is in this place
you fit the bill.

125
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:19,036
She'll make you feel like the greatest
while you get her whatever she needs,

126
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,596
and once she gets what
she wants, she'll move on.

127
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,934
When she does,

128
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,843
don't take it personally, man.

129
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,402
Messed up my ride, chief.

130
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,652
Hey, there you are.

131
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:17,695
Come help me with this.
I'm completely destroying it.

132
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,698
- You seem to be doing just fine.
- Yeah, fine at making it collapse.

133
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,238
You're very capable, Shannon.

134
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,002
I'm sure you'd be all right
building it on your own.

135
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,746
What's going on?

136
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,045
Perhaps you should find
another friend

137
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,749
to help you with your shelter.

138
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,628
You've been talking to my brother,
haven't you?

139
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,264
Oh, gross!

140
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,175
Gross to you, dinner to me.

141
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,612
Boone, where is he?

142
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,080
- Don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

143
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,586
- You two are like jungle pals.
- Sorry. I haven't seen him.

144
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,588
Well, if you do see him,
tell him to keep his mouth shut.

145
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,056
If he has something to say,
leave Sayid out of it

146
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,787
- And say it to my face.
- Should I be writing this down?

147
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:26,490
Just tell him to stay
the hell out of my business.

148
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,055
Do you like him?

149
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,398
- What?
- Sayid.

150
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,230
Are you serious?

151
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,742
Because if you do like him,

152
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,007
what's it got to do
with your brother?

153
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,178
You're a grown woman.

154
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,651
You can yell at Boone
'til you're blue in the face,

155
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,881
all you're doing
is giving him what he wants.

156
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,152
- Yeah, what's that?
- Your attention.

157
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,424
Everyone gets a new life
on this island, Shannon.

158
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,199
Maybe it's time you start yours.

159
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,444
You must be pretty scared, huh?

160
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,145
Scared. You understand
scared, don't you? Huh?

161
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,350
If you ain't,

162
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,153
you're gonna be, Bruce.

163
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,920
Folks down on the beach might
have been doctors and accountants

164
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,156
a month ago,

165
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,927
<i>but it's Lord of the Flies time now.</i>

166
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,420
- Michael! Take it easy!
- I'll take it easy, all right!

167
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,192
Hang on, man!

168
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,757
- Hey, you burned my raft?
- Just calm down.

169
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,395
- Hey, step aside.
- Just calm down!

170
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,837
You burned my raft?
Why'd you burn my raft, man?

171
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,875
Calm down and think
about it a minute.

172
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:20,002
- Look at his hands.
- Back off, Jack.

173
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,308
Shut it!
Everyone's gotta chill out!

174
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,565
What'd he say?

175
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,303
You said something to me?

176
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,105
Michael!

177
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,772
Say it again.
No, no, say it again, man!

178
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,915
- Hey! Hey!
- Easy, doc!

179
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,686
- One fight at a time.
- He's right. This is between them.

180
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,622
Stop it!

181
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,932
Leave him alone!

182
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:02,913
He didn't burn your raft.

183
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,655
- You speak English?
- Didn't see that coming.

184
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,224
You understood us all this time?
Why didn't you say anything?

185
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:27,863
Your raft was already on fire
when he arrived.

186
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,737
He burned his hands
trying to put it out.

187
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,504
Then why did he run?

188
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,751
Exactly. That's what I thought.

189
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:51,057
My husband is many things,
but he is not a liar.

190
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,893
You're gonna lecture us
about lying, Betty?

191
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,523
From the look on his face,

192
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,694
even your old man here
didn't know you speak English.

193
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,206
- How do we know she's not covering?
- Because she isn't!

194
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,807
- Why would he burn the raft?
- He's been after me!

195
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,347
- Everybody knows it!
- OK, it's personal.

196
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,407
Why take it out on our best chance
at getting off the island?

197
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,715
Why would any one of us
block an attempt to get home?

198
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,489
We're so intent on pointing
the finger at one another

199
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,687
that we're ignoring
the simple undeniable truth

200
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,596
that the problem isn't here,
it's there!

201
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,394
They've attacked us!

202
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:32,664
Sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.

203
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:37,333
Maybe it's time we stop blaming us
and started worrying about them!

204
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,507
We're not the only people
on this island,

205
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,549
and we all know it!

206
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,749
He did not do it.

207
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,274
Look at this.

208
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,648
I can't salvage a thing.

209
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,150
Pontoons, the decking...

210
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,312
Fire burnt up all the twine!

211
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,979
Damn it!

212
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,420
God...

213
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,204
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's OK.

214
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,204
No.

215
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:19,641
Come here.
Come here.

216
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:25,342
Look...
We all have setbacks.

217
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,714
I mean, God knows, man.

218
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,685
That's just life.

219
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,218
We'll start over, all right?

220
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,820
You're gonna build another one?

221
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,023
Yeah. A better one.

222
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,727
Can I help?

223
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,700
No doubt you can help.

224
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,532
Come on!

225
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,920
I was going to leave you!

226
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,091
I was going to get away.

227
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,554
But you made me change my mind.

228
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,033
You made me think
that you still loved me.

229
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,317
What was that for?

230
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,016
Everyone gets a new life
on this island.

231
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,296
I'd like to start now.

232
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,147
Got yourself an opponent?

233
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,685
Hurley owes me $83,000.

234
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,189
I told him I'd give him
a chance to win it back.

235
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,259
It's been a while
since you and I played.

236
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,334
- I don't have $83,000.
- That's OK.

237
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,667
- Where's your pop?
- Down at the beach, I think.

238
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,972
I'm not allowed to leave
the caves after dark.

239
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,248
Do you have a dad?

240
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,181
Everyone's got a dad.

241
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,809
Is he cool?

242
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,623
No.

243
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,591
No, he's not.

244
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,695
- Yes!
- Good for you.

245
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,262
Hey, you mind
if I ask you something?

246
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,830
Sure.

247
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,378
Why did you burn the raft, Walt?

248
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,790
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell.

249
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:25,023
You must have had
a really good reason.

250
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,233
I don't want to move anymore.

251
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,664
I've been moving places
my whole life.

252
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,114
I like it here.

253
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,920
I like it here too.

254
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,105
Boat.

255
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,250
Hey.

256
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,094
<i>* Damien Rice: Delicate</i>

257
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,850
Son of a bitch.
