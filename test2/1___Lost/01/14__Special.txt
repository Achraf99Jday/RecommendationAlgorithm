1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,432
<i> Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,598
- I think I'm all right.
- I told you I'd take care of you.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,972
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're quite welcome.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,803
- Listen to me.
- Sayid.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,814
- We're not alone.
- Has anyone seen Ethan?

6
00:00:15,882 --> 00:00:17,577
He took off to the beach.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,312
- Where's Charlie?
- He went after Claire.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,151
Footprints, three sets,
all over the place.

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,656
I think they've been taken.

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:29,390
Claire.
All they wanted was Claire.

11
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,522
Walt!

12
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:36,833
Walt!

13
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,266
Walt!

14
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,867
Walt!

15
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,637
Have you seen Claire's bags?

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,941
- You seen my son?
- You seen her bags?

17
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,412
- Claire's?
- Her luggage.

18
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:51,006
No one seems to know
what's happened to it.

19
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,314
Sorry, I don't know.
I'm just looking for Walt.

20
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,355
Oh. Got it. Sorry.
I've not seen him.

21
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,255
Hey, Jack. You seen my boy
when you were out there?

22
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,056
No. He was at the caves.

23
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,189
Yeah, he took his dog for a walk.
Told him to stay close as usual.

24
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,757
You listened to your old man
when you were ten?

25
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,532
Uh, yeah, I listened.
Maybe a little too well.

26
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,096
Yo, dudes,
got a new tourney lined up.

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,338
We're playing for deodorant sticks.
You dawgs up for some golf?

28
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,743
I gotta go find my kid.

29
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,543
Hey, if Walt shows up,

30
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,913
tell him to stay right here
until I get back.

31
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,542
You got it.

32
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,245
- Walt!
- He seems to hate it, doesn't he?

33
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,417
- What?
- Being a dad.

34
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,224
No, it's just...
a lot of hard work.

35
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,265
Walt?

36
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,391
Walt!

37
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,799
Nah, he hates it.

38
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,663
Walt?

39
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,176
Walt?

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,549
Walt!

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,917
This is the one.

42
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,290
This is definitely my baby's crib.

43
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,089
Uh-huh.

44
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,064
Beautiful.

45
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,998
It'll look great in the alley
we'll be living in.

46
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,867
- This is three months' rent.
- What? It's not three...

47
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,800
Look, don't you want
the best for this kid?

48
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,640
I know you're excited,
but we can't afford this.

49
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:29,307
Our baby in this crib.
Come on. That's a happy kid.

50
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,381
I talked to Andy. He said he can
throw some work my way.

51
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,719
- Construction? What about your art?
- No.

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,317
I'm not giving it up. I'll take a break
until you finish law school.

53
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,797
Pass the bar, get hired by some
fancy-ass, high-paying law firm.

54
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:48,561
Somebody's got it all figured.

55
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,796
I'll get back to painting eventually.

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,737
Meanwhile, you can
support me and Walt

57
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:57,298
in the manner to which
we'll soon become accustomed.

58
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,969
"Walt," huh?

59
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,572
I'd like to do that, you know?
Name him after my dad.

60
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,511
Walter.

61
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:10,055
Walter Lloyd.

62
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,556
"Lloyd"?

63
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,956
Oh, all right. That's why
you won't marry me.

64
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,895
It's not that marriage is too prosaic.
You want him to have your last name.

65
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,694
Hey, you want me
to agree to "Walter," or what?

66
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:37,180
- Man, I suck.
- You can do better than that.

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,447
- You might wanna take it easy on him.
- See this knot, Walt?

68
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,885
I want you to aim for it.
Right here.

69
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,059
Focus on it. All right?

70
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,357
Picture it in your mind's eye.

71
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,920
You know what that is, right?

72
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:56,230
- A picture in your head.
- Right. Do it again, but see it.

73
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,266
See it before you do it.

74
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,339
Visualize the path. See it.

75
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,400
See it.

76
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,087
- Whoa.
- Yes!

77
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,626
I knew you had it in you.

78
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,289
It was weird. I actually saw it
in my mind like it was real.

79
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,925
- Who's to say it wasn't?
- Hey!

80
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,628
What the hell is going on?

81
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,192
- Gimme that.
- But I...

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,762
- Take Vincent and go back to camp.
- Mr. Locke...

83
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,398
Now, little man.

84
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,978
- You gave my boy a knife?
- You should've seen...

85
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,254
Don't tell me what I should've seen.
Back home, I'd call the police on you!

86
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,192
Encouraging a kid to sneak away.

87
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,958
- Giving him a knife?
- Walt knows his own mind.

88
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,092
- Don't talk to me like you know him!
- You need to calm down.

89
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,160
You keep playing my son against me,
and I'm gonna have a...

90
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,842
The man said "calm down."

91
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:16,678
- What are you, his attack dog?
- Easy. You were waving the knife.

92
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,513
He was trying to make sure
you didn't hurt someone.

93
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,824
Michael, I know it's been difficult
to bond with your son.

94
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,656
You know why he's attached to me?

95
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,662
Because I treat him like an adult.

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,425
He's ten years old.

97
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,023
He's been through
more than most people.

98
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,628
You haven't spent enough time with him
to see it, but he's different.

99
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,238
- What did you say?
- And we're not back home.

100
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,075
As long as we're here, Walt should
be allowed to realize his potential.

101
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:58,253
You stay away from my son.
And me.

102
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,744
You're not taking him.
You're not taking my son.

103
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,687
You can go if you want to,
but Walt stays with me.

104
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,021
- I'm trying to have a discussion.
- You're not.

105
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:37,392
You're talking about going to Amsterdam.
You and him. How is that a discussion?

106
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,693
It's an offer,
and that's where the job is.

107
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,131
You said you were happy.

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,192
What about the legal clinic
being a good fit? You said that.

109
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,101
This is a huge opportunity.

110
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
I've wanted to do International Law.

111
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,711
Am I supposed to be happy for you?
For your huge opportunity?

112
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,783
We've talked about
taking some time apart.

113
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,218
Look, babe,
I thought that was...

114
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,594
Hey, we said a lot of things.

115
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,294
You said you wanted
to live on a boat.

116
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,163
I still love you.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,802
You know I do, but we've been through
so much in such a short time.

118
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,572
- Things...
- Babe, we got problems.

119
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,515
That's what people have.
You wanna go to counseling?

120
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,109
I'm down with that.
Let's go. Right?

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,555
Oh, man.

122
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,158
You already took it, didn't you?

123
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,892
The job.

124
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,369
Yeah, I did.

125
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,004
You haven't worked in months.

126
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,476
Construction slows
in the winter. I told you.

127
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,843
I can provide for him,
give him everything.

128
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,314
Except for his dad.
He's not going with you! No!

129
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:08,149
- You wanna argue about this?
- Yes. There are laws against this.

130
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,984
We're not married, Michael.

131
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,548
I'm his mother, and I'm employed.
Who is the court gonna side with?

132
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,702
This is not goodbye forever.

133
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,802
I just...

134
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,573
I need some time.

135
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,394
Are you all right?

136
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,701
I'm okay. Thanks.

137
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,210
I just don't know how to talk to him.

138
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,183
How to get him to,

139
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,277
you know,
understand I'm on his side.

140
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,551
Locke says I should stop
treating him like a child.

141
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,460
I missed his whole childhood, so...

142
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,060
It just can't happen.

143
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,973
What?

144
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,536
He can't grow up here.

145
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,509
He can't grow up in this place.

146
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,585
Once I realized these equations were
coordinates, latitude and longitude,

147
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,855
I assumed she was trying to determine
the location of the island.

148
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,625
But it was incomplete,
her notations fragmented.

149
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,259
- Except for the fish song.
- Mm-hmm.

150
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,766
- The what?
- When I lay the pages down like this,

151
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,399
I realized it wasn't showing
the location of the island.

152
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,539
I think it's a location on the island.
Specifically, here.

153
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,948
So where are we?
In relation to the triangle?

154
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,816
Well, the map is hardly at scale,
so I don't know.

155
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,645
We're not even sure it's a map
of this island, are we?

156
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:29,021
We're not. This may be the transmitter
sending out her distress call,

157
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,586
- And its power source.
- What are we talking about?

158
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,998
Another excuse to get chased down and
killed by whatever lives in the jungle?

159
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,629
Guys, we can't keep doing this.

160
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,697
Building water filtration systems,
playing golf, making a sweet home here.

161
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,211
- We need to get off this island!
- You think any of us wanna be here?

162
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,304
No. But I don't think anyone
wants to get off as much as I do.

163
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,247
So, are you suggesting something?

164
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:55,310
- Yeah. We build a raft.
- A raft?

165
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,846
Look, don't say it like that.
We need a little optimism here.

166
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,824
Okay? We gotta
do something, 'cause,

167
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,157
let's be honest,
no one's coming.

168
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,499
Those seats we took
off the fuselage, they float.

169
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,696
And we got an axe.
And a whole bunch of trees, bamboo.

170
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,797
- We can do this.
- The chances of surviving rough waters,

171
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,900
- The odds of finding a shipping lane...
- And I get seasick.

172
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,943
You know what?
Great. Stay here.

173
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,348
Grow old, good luck. But I'm doing this.
My son and I are leaving.

174
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,411
Anybody that wants to help us build,
God bless you.

175
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,461
Hey, Walt.

176
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,265
Hey, come on.
I need your help with something.

177
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:22,171
- I'm doing stuff.
- You're reading comics in Spanish,

178
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,268
- And you don't read Spanish, man.
- I like the pictures.

179
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,212
You like the art, huh?

180
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,045
I guess so.

181
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,253
You know, when I was your age,
maybe a little older,

182
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,985
I traced comics.
Taught myself about perspective.

183
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,391
You know what that is?
Perspective?

184
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,757
- Hey.
- I said I need your help. Let's go.

185
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,029
- Why do I have to come?
- I seen what happens

186
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,128
when I don't keep an eye on you.

187
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,307
<i>- Let me talk to him.
- He's 21 months old. </i>

188
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,244
<i>- He doesn't use the phone. 
- I'll talk.</i>

189
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:05,078
I just want him to hear my voice.
I miss him.

190
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
<i>I know. Let me call you back. 
This isn't a good time. </i>

191
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,618
<i>- We gotta go? 
- It's Michael. </i>

192
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,087
<i>- Honey. 
- I'm getting off... </i>

193
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,250
<i>- Who's that?
- Let's talk tomorrow. </i>

194
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,919
What the hell is going on?

195
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,062
<i>Michael, listen. </i>

196
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,328
<i>I've been seeing someone. </i>

197
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:23,626
What?

198
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,363
Who?

199
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,928
<i>- Does it make any diff. Erence? 
- Who is it?</i>

200
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,474
<i>Brian Porter. </i>

201
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,103
<i>- The guy who hired you?
- It wasn't like that before. </i>

202
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,148
When you said you needed
time to think, you were lying.

203
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,150
<i>- No, I did, and I realized... 
- I'm coming to Amsterdam.</i>

204
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,278
<i>- Don't. It's over between us. 
- I'm not coming for you.</i>

205
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm coming for Walt.
I'm getting my son back.

206
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,528
Call an ambulance!
Help me.

207
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,167
Charlie?

208
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,472
Hey.

209
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,906
These are Claire's.
Who brought them here?

210
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,543
- I did. Why? What are you doing?
- I don't know where it is.

211
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,850
- What?
- Claire's diary.

212
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,518
She kept her diary in this pocket.
I know because I saw her put it there.

213
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,055
Someone's taken it.

214
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,394
What are we looking for again?

215
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,400
Any piece of metal
or plastic tubing.

216
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,665
Anything that looks like
it'd work as a frame.

217
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,168
- A frame for what?
- You'll see soon enough.

218
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,907
Separate cushions, plastic, tarp.

219
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:42,243
Put everything you find in
different piles so we can take stock.

220
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,615
Am I being punished?

221
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,416
You think working
with your old man is punishment?

222
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,046
No, man.

223
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,320
This is us taking control
of our destiny.

224
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,222
Feels like punishment.

225
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,026
Sawyer.

226
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,524
Hey, Sawyer.

227
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,238
- You know, I could just go inside.
- Trick or treat.

228
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,039
- So, what are you two selling today?
- Where's Claire's diary?

229
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,982
- Someone took it from her bag.
- Oh, I get it.

230
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,782
Something goes missing, and you
figure it's gotta be me that took it.

231
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,413
Do you have the diary or not?

232
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,622
- You mean this one?
- Give it to me.

233
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,786
I'm not sure
that's the best idea.

234
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,956
Maybe Missy Claire
don't want you reading it.

235
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,967
- I wasn't gonna read it.
- Curious what she wrote about you?

236
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,170
You bastard.
Did you read it?

237
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,229
Good literature's scarce around here.

238
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,070
- He read it!
- Just give it to us.

239
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:48,079
"Dear Diary, I'm getting really
freaked out by that has-been pop star.

240
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,172
- I think he's stalking me."
- Sawyer!

241
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,980
"Diary, the little limey runt
just won't let up." Ow!

242
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,350
- You hit like a ponce.
- Oh, yeah?

243
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,088
All right, enough.

244
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,493
You didn't really read it, did you?

245
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,466
I just hadn't
gotten around to it yet.

246
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,886
Um, I'm gonna get some water.

247
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,691
Yeah, okay.

248
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,958
Would you bring me some?

249
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,661
Please?

250
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,865
Please and thank you.
We gotta work on that.

251
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,464
Boone.

252
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,543
Hi. So you guys just gonna keep
coming back without any food?

253
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,841
- Hey, I'm serious.
- Uh-huh.

254
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,714
What's going on with you?

255
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,879
Could you be acting any weirder?

256
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,551
You've been a functioning bulimic
since junior high.

257
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,356
I thought you'd be excited
about dropping a size or two.

258
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,728
Since you're not having any luck
with the hunting,

259
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,564
maybe you should help Michael.
He's building a raft.

260
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,702
I was thinking I would help him out.
Finally get out of here.

261
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,409
Why don't you help me?

262
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,608
No, thanks.

263
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,361
Your father doesn't want us
spending time together.

264
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,662
He's not the boss of me.

265
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,258
But he's your father.

266
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,871
He cares about you,
and you need to show him respect.

267
00:17:56,675 --> 00:18:00,634
I'm serious, Walt.
You're not to come to me anymore.

268
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,714
Damn it!
What is wrong with you?

269
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,918
- I was just coming to see...
- I told you to stay away from my son!

270
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,955
- I was...
- I don't want to hear you!

271
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,253
I was giving him this pencil
to give to you.

272
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,054
I thought you could use it.

273
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,096
Consider it a peace offering.

274
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,497
I catch you with my son again,
I'll kill you.

275
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,922
- You're a jerk.
- What did you say to me?

276
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,190
- He didn't do anything. He's my friend!
- He's not anymore.

277
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,061
- I'm looking out for you.
- You never cared about me.

278
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,067
- What?
- You showed up after Mom died.

279
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,399
Where were you when
I was growing up? Nowhere!

280
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,802
Listen, Walt.
It's complicated.

281
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,602
I don't care!
You're not my father!

282
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,779
You wanna hate me?

283
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,577
You gonna punish me for something
I can't change? Fine.

284
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,811
But you will listen to me.

285
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,055
Now, you get over there,

286
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,455
and you stay there.

287
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,525
Now!

288
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:05,533
- That's really wonderful.
- Oh, thanks.

289
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,164
For my son.
He's gonna be two next week.

290
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,333
Yeah?
I didn't know you have a kid.

291
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,843
Yeah. Yeah.

292
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,313
He lives in Amsterdam
with his mom.

293
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,679
Ever get to visit him?

294
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,685
No, not yet.

295
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,382
I had a little, you know,
run-in with a car.

296
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,358
I never know what to write.

297
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,329
- How about a joke?
- I don't know. What kinda joke?

298
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:35,491
How about "What's black,
white and red all over?"

299
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,730
- Yeah, a newspaper, right?
- "A penguin with a sunburn."

300
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,634
- That's really dumb.
- Trust me.

301
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,370
Mother of four talking here.
He'll get a kick out of it.

302
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,546
Hello, Michael.

303
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,958
Susan?

304
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,890
Finally called Andy when I hadn't
heard from you in over two months.

305
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:13,137
I had to hear about your accident
from him. You should've called me.

306
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,566
Yeah, well, considering how
our last conversation went...

307
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,636
I'm so sorry about that.

308
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,114
- Hey, did you bring Walt?
- No. He's at home.

309
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,285
Home.

310
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,684
With Brian?

311
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,720
So, what are you
doing here, anyway?

312
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,491
I came to see you.

313
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,794
So, I look pretty good, huh?

314
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,596
Not that bad.

315
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,161
They say you're expected
to make a full recovery.

316
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,434
Yeah, after a year
of physical therapy.

317
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,907
A year.

318
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:55,506
- I'm covering all your medical costs.
- What?

319
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,140
I've already spoken
to the hospital administrator,

320
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:01,276
- And all your bills are coming to me.
- What is this about?

321
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,147
Brian and I are getting married.

322
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,294
- How nice for...
- You don't have to say anything.

323
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,762
Just listen.

324
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,197
We're moving to Italy
at the end of the month.

325
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,326
Brian's taking over
the Rome offices.

326
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,131
Sounds like Brian's on a roll.

327
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,204
And he wants to adopt Walt.

328
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,207
Look, I know this is hard.

329
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,713
But just think about it.

330
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,148
- You're kidding me, right?
- Consider what's best for Walt.

331
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,482
You can keep holding on
if you want.

332
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,250
But ask yourself
why you're doing that.

333
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,985
Is it really for him?

334
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,788
Or is it for you?

335
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,664
Uh, dude, your kid's gone.

336
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:53,727
What?

337
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,273
He just grabbed the dog
and took off.

338
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,541
I know where he's gone.

339
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,451
Locke!

340
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,055
- Where the hell is he?
- What?

341
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:18,994
I'm not in the mood
for your games, man.

342
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,532
- Where's Walt?
- Walt's not here.

343
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
- Don't lie to me.
- He's not here. Look around.

344
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,469
- I'm not talking to you.
- I told him this morning

345
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,506
that he couldn't
be around me anymore.

346
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,973
I'm trying to respect your wishes.

347
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,741
Well, then if he's not...

348
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,419
Let's go find your boy.

349
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,797
Thanks.

350
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,830
You really didn't
have to help, you know.

351
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:00,735
I could've managed.

352
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,206
I've had my share
of manly encounters.

353
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,300
I just thought
you could use the company.

354
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,841
You okay?

355
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,716
Yeah.

356
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,317
It's weird.

357
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,257
I barely knew her.
Barely know her... Claire.

358
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,531
She's been missing
over a week, and...

359
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,899
...every day she's gone,
it feels like...

360
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,031
...bits of me are crumbling,
or something.

361
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,806
I think it's right that
you should keep her stuff safe...

362
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,711
...'til she gets back.

363
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:47,877
Yeah.

364
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,575
Come on, Vincent.

365
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,701
Vincent! Cut it out!

366
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,237
Cut it out! What's wrong?

367
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,472
Vincent!

368
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,314
Vincent! Vincent!

369
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,024
He was trying to weasel his way out.

370
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,226
Anything not to let the case go forward.
Said it wasn't his jurisdiction.

371
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,291
- You're kidding me.
- I wish I was.

372
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,064
Same argument,
third time in a row.

373
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,230
Barclay said it was
an immigration issue.

374
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,603
That's classic.

375
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,607
He thinks 'cause I'm new to
Australian law that I'm some yokel.

376
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,239
Hey. Hello? Homework.

377
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,545
- I told you I need help.
- He needs help.

378
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,086
I'm a lawyer. I can tell
when someone's stalling.

379
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,350
Who cares about birds of Australia?
We're in Australia.

380
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:09,927
- You okay?
- I think I'm feeling kind of fluey.

381
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,963
Shouldn't we study
birds of Egypt?

382
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,693
You haven't been sleeping much.
Maybe you need to take a personal day.

383
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,234
I picked the bronze-cuckoo.

384
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,964
- It's funny, wanna see?
- What about Barclay?

385
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,302
I mean, it doesn't look funny.
Just the name.

386
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,400
Sleeping in late?
That's too much of a fantasy.

387
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,944
Look!

388
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,175
You're not looking!

389
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,815
You're not looking!

390
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,720
Oh, my God!

391
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,693
Is it dead?

392
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,897
Yeah.

393
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,667
Poor guy.

394
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,959
Vincent!

395
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,559
Vincent!

396
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,955
Michael Dawson?

397
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,856
Yeah. Can I help you?

398
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,959
Yeah. I'm Brian Porter.

399
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,857
Susan's Brian?

400
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,126
Yeah.

401
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:04,468
Can I come in?

402
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,908
I... I need to talk to you.

403
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,570
Susan know you're here, man?

404
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,638
Susan died yesterday.

405
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,620
Please?

406
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,425
Um...

407
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,893
She, uh...

408
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,191
Turns out she had a blood disorder.

409
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,928
She was only sick
for about a week.

410
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,369
I didn't know...

411
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,636
I hadn't talked to her in awhile...
Sit down.

412
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,204
And Walt?

413
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,178
- How is he, uh...?
- Yeah, he's fine.

414
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,982
He's back home with his nanny.

415
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,347
- What?
- I mean he's fine...

416
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:50,080
I mean, considering...
You know.

417
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,521
You left him home?
After he just lost his mother?

418
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,553
Before she died, Susan,

419
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:01,395
she told me she wanted you
to have custody of Walter.

420
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,592
She what?

421
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:06,433
Well, I think she just thought...
I mean, since you're his father...

422
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,802
I haven't been his father
in nine years.

423
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:13,710
Yeah, well,
that's kinda the thing, see?

424
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,544
Look, I loved Susan very much.

425
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,008
And I was honest with her
from the beginning,

426
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,645
but she wouldn't hear it.

427
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,783
- Hear what?
- That I...

428
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,349
I didn't want to be a father.
I just don't know how.

429
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,952
What are you talking about?
You adopted him.

430
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,691
I did, because she wanted that,

431
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,460
and I wanted her, and...

432
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,659
Look...

433
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,331
Two tickets.
One round-trip, the other one-way.

434
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,207
Sydney to New York. The envelope
has money in it for travel expenses.

435
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,812
She didn't tell you
she wanted me to have custody.

436
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,349
- This is your idea.
- I'm a wreck right now, okay?

437
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,975
I'm supposed to give a damn?

438
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,748
I just lost the woman I love.
I can't be his father.

439
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,881
Lying son of a bitch!
You're the only father he knows!

440
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,893
It's more than that.
There's something about him.

441
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,854
What the hell
are you talking about?

442
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,769
Sometimes when he's around,
things happen.

443
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,873
He's different somehow.

444
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,447
Over here!

445
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,916
- What the hell would...
- Help, please! Help!

446
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,151
- Walt?
- This way.

447
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,186
Walt! Walt!

448
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,966
Walt should be home
from school any minute.

449
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,437
Mr. Porter asked me
to give you that.

450
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,973
Some of Susan's effects.

451
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,275
Oh, thanks.

452
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,611
There's something else.

453
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:07,789
- What's that?
- Something I think Walt should have.

454
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,560
Excuse me.

455
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,988
- Walt?
- Yeah?

456
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,499
There's somebody here to see you.

457
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,914
Dad! Help!

458
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:11,679
- Dad!
- Walt!

459
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,953
Dad, help! Please!

460
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,119
- Help!
- Hey, Walt...

461
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,321
Shh!

462
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,626
Dad!

463
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,833
Come on! Up here! Michael!

464
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,304
Dad!

465
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,267
Dad...

466
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,278
Hey, Walt.

467
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,623
Who are you?

468
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,593
I'm, uh...

469
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,203
I'm your father.

470
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,706
Hey...

471
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,414
Um...

472
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,216
I want you to know...

473
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,884
Listen, I can't explain
how sorry I am...

474
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,222
...about your mom.

475
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,788
You should know that we, uh...

476
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,401
...we loved each other
very much when we had you.

477
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,200
Where's Brian?

478
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,175
Brian's not here.

479
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,647
I come to bring you home with me.

480
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,642
I'm not going anywhere with you.

481
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,787
Look, Walt, can I...?

482
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,993
Uh...

483
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:03,056
I know this is really hard
to understand. All of this.

484
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,564
See, Brian...

485
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,101
Brian loves you very much.

486
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,907
And he wants you to stay with him,
but it's not his choice.

487
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,312
It's mine.

488
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,509
I'm your legal guardian.

489
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,452
And, uh, it's not like he's gonna
disappear from your life.

490
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,754
He'll still call you,
write to you,

491
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,521
come to see you
whenever he can.

492
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:36,197
And you know,
you'll still have your dog.

493
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,238
But Vincent isn't mine.

494
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,704
He's Brian's.

495
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,833
Brian said you could have him.

496
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:55,944
Dad.

497
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,750
- Hey, Walt!
- Dad! Dad!

498
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,087
- Where are you, Dad?
- Hang on!

499
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,299
Oh...

500
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,064
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

501
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:21,241
Walt, hang in there, okay?

502
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,011
I'm coming, man.

503
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,251
- Dad!
- Walt!

504
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,050
Throw him the knife.

505
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,189
Walt.

506
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,364
If he comes near you, use it!

507
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,038
Stay there, buddy!

508
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,583
- Come here.
- Dad!

509
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,222
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

510
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,053
- Yeah.
- All right.

511
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,561
Whatever you do, you hold
onto this tight. You got me?

512
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,859
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

513
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:17,560
I'll be right behind you, okay?
So hold on.

514
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:19,102
Okay, Locke, now!

515
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,703
Pull him.

516
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,038
Pull him, Locke.

517
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,539
Come here.

518
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,346
I'm sorry...

519
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,086
No, it's okay.

520
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,557
We're okay.

521
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,030
- I'm just glad you're safe.
- But Vincent, he ran off again.

522
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,398
He found his way
back to you once, Walt.

523
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,763
He will again.

524
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,451
Hey.

525
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,625
I got a present for you.

526
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,961
Since you like to look at pictures.

527
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,800
- What's this?
- Well...

528
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:11,006
Every card, every letter I sent you
over the last eight years.

529
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,242
- You wrote me?
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,282
I never saw these.

531
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,256
Did my mom have these?

532
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:37,101
- Why didn't she give 'em to me?
- I don't know.

533
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,041
She didn't throw 'em away,
which means, somewhere inside,

534
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,840
she wanted you to have them.

535
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,409
So, you drew these?

536
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,280
Just for you.

537
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,618
This one...

538
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,282
...I did for your second birthday.

539
00:39:57,595 --> 00:40:00,860
A penguin with a sunburn?

540
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,530
- That's dumb.
- Yeah, I know.

541
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,865
That's what I said.

542
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:52,773
Jack!

543
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,846
Sayid.

544
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,476
You have to hear this.

545
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,183
- What is that?
- It's Claire's, her diary.

546
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:03,454
- You're reading her diary?
- Yeah, I know, I'm bloody scum.

547
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,018
Just listen to this.
"I had that weird dream again

548
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,360
with the black rock
I can't get away from.

549
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,195
I try to leave, but it won't let me."

550
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,531
- Black rock?
- They're just dreams.

551
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,766
- No.
- Sayid mentioned the black rock before.

552
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,207
The Frenchwoman said her team
was returning from the black rock.

553
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,404
The triangle on the map.

554
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,073
Maybe it's the triangle.

555
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,583
Maybe it's where
Claire was taken.

556
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,212
Maybe. Charlie,
we all want to find Claire.

557
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,686
But there's no sense going out into
the jungle in the middle of the night.

558
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,299
Don't think that
whistle's working, John.

559
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,071
You can't hear everything, Boone.

560
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,573
The sooner you learn that,
the better.

561
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,977
Well, I heard that.

562
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,344
Vincent.

563
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,684
Vincent, is that you?

564
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,162
Vincent.

565
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,314
Claire?
