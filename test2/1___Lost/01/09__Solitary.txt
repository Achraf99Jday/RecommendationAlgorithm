1
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,870
- Ow! Easy, jackass.
- You want it easy, quit moaning.

2
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,246
- I got to change these bandages.
- Try not taking my skin off with them.

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,879
How'd I score
the house call, Dr. Quinn?

4
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,253
- Trying to ease your conscience?
- My conscience is fine, thanks.

5
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,493
Of course, what have you got
to feel guilty about?

6
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,621
I mean, you just let that
damn Arab torture me.

7
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,632
Stood by and watched.
Now you figure you'll patch me up

8
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,534
and buy you a ticket into heaven?
Only reason you're here...

9
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,233
I'm here because no one else
wants anything to do with you.

10
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,310
She does.

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,344
Change your own bandages.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,070
Looking for someone,
or just admiring the view?

13
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,370
It's been two days
since Sayid took off on his own.

14
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,467
I keep thinking
I'm gonna see him.

15
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,069
He'll come when he's
found what he's looking for,

16
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,310
- The French transmission.
- He wasn't looking for anything.

17
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,416
- He left because of what happened.
- It was an accident.

18
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,615
Well, accidents happen when
you torture people, Jack.

19
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,125
Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate.

20
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,187
He can take care of himself.

21
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,761
Hello?

22
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,326
Hello?

23
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,690
Ew! Get him out of there!
He's drinking our water.

24
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,390
- What's going on out there?
- You know, the usual.

25
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,125
People yelling at each other.

26
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,134
Doc, what do you
think this is, this...

27
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,931
...this rash?
It's bad, right?

28
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,598
- Some kind of a tropical disease?
- It's hives.

29
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,733
What's that?
Is that like poison ivy?

30
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,208
It's a common rash,

31
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,644
sometimes brought on
by heat and stress.

32
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,842
- Just try to relax. It'll clear up.
- Right.

33
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,885
- Try to keep your mind off it.
- Okay.

34
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,853
What is that?
Is that like aloe?

35
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,356
Isn't that for sunburn or something?

36
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,484
"Try to keep your mind off it"?

37
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,427
What else has that guy
got to do but stress?

38
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,659
I have enough without having
to treat hypochondriacs.

39
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,496
That's like my point, man.

40
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,263
We're all fried.

41
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,334
I mean, have you taken
a look at everybody out there?

42
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,433
Everybody's way tense.

43
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,104
Dude, I'm just saying,
it... it'd be sweet

44
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,648
if we could have...

45
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,310
I don't know, something to do.

46
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,444
We're surviving here, Hurley.

47
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,353
And that's my main concern,
is keeping us alive.

48
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,024
Things could be worse.

49
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,128
How?

50
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,490
<i>Ou est Alex? 
Where is Alex? </i>

51
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,396
<i>¿Dónde está Alex? </i>

52
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,097
<i>Where is Alex? </i>

53
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,335
<i>¿Dónde está Alex? </i>

54
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,504
<i>Où est Alex? </i>

55
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,411
<i>Where is Alex? </i>

56
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,972
<i>Where is Alex? </i>

57
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,575
<i>Où est Alex?</i>

58
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,582
<i>¿Dónde está Alex? </i>

59
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,997
- What?
- Where is Alex?

60
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,442
<i>- Who are you?
- Wo ist Alex?</i>

61
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,569
- Where is Alex?

62
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,041
I don't know
what you are talking about.

63
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:07,650
- Where is Alex?

64
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,761
- Please, let's not...
- Where is Alex?

65
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,458
I don't know any Alex.

66
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,992
Stop!

67
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,938
And all the pain will stop.

68
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,172
Your Shiite friends have already
implicated you in the bombing.

69
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,976
You planted the device
in the headquarters!

70
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,987
You killed two soldiers!

71
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,389
Confess it, and perhaps
it will only cost you your hands

72
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,518
instead of your life.

73
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,461
He doesn't know anything.

74
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,370
- Your sources were wrong.
- Perhaps.

75
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,967
But that's really not the point, is it?

76
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,570
- You handled yourself well in there.
- Did I?

77
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,844
I put in for your reassignment
to intelligence division,

78
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,216
- If you still wish it.
- Yes, sir. Very much so.

79
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,085
Good. But stop calling me "sir"
when it's just the two of us.

80
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,550
You're my superior officer, Omar.

81
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,822
For now.

82
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,456
And I'll enjoy it
while it lasts.

83
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,897
That reminds me,

84
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,493
in addition to your
increased responsibilities,

85
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,061
a promotion is commensurate
with your move.

86
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,870
That is, if you won't miss
being a communications officer.

87
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,938
- I am willing to make that sacrifice.
- Good.

88
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,721
- Hi.
- Yo.

89
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,660
- What's this?
- They must have fallen from the plane.

90
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,323
What are you doing
in the jungle at night?

91
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,300
- Best time to hunt.
- Ethan here has some experience.

92
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,769
He spotted tracks that might be
a rabbit or some other rodent.

93
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,669
Rodent. Yum.

94
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,935
People are getting tired
of boar meat.

95
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,239
You got that right.

96
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,777
All right, well,
I'll take a look at these,

97
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,181
- See if there's anything useful.
- Okay.

98
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,061
Mr. Locke.

99
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,197
Are you going back out to hunt?

100
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,832
- For a bit.
- Can I go with you?

101
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,434
I mean, I just want to learn
how to do what you do.

102
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,910
Walt!

103
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,243
I was... I was talking
to Mr. Locke about...

104
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:21,184
I know what you're doing.
Not gonna happen, man. Get back to bed.

105
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,825
Whoa, dude...

106
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,868
Please just listen to me!

107
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,205
I keep telling you
I don't know who Alex is!

108
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,779
I'm a survivor of a plane crash.

109
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,647
I found the wire on the beach.
I followed it.

110
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,619
I thought it might
have something to do with

111
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,521
a transmission
we picked up on a receiver.

112
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,355
A recording, a mayday

113
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,887
with a French woman
repeating on a loop for 16 years.

114
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,876
Sixteen years.

115
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,382
Has it really been that long?

116
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,184
You.

117
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,388
You just happened
to hear my distress call?

118
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,100
I know what you are.

119
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,057
Rousseau.

120
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,732
- How do you know my name?
- I read it.

121
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,796
There, on the jacket.

122
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,134
What is this place?

123
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,535
Those batteries wouldn't be able
to produce enough power

124
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,377
to transmit your distress call
all these years.

125
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,849
Broadcasts from somewhere else.

126
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,050
But they control it now.

127
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,787
They?

128
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,286
You. And the others like you.

129
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,989
I...

130
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,966
I don't know who you think I am.
I've already told you. I am not...

131
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,160
Sayid?

132
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,135
- How...?
- My name was on a jacket.

133
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,836
Yours is on the envelope you carry.
Who is she?

134
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,944
The woman in the photographs.

135
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,722
Nadia.

136
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,122
Her name is Nadia.

137
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,488
We cannot tie Noor Abed Jazeem
to the bombing,

138
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,294
but we know her sympathies.

139
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,531
She's a known associate
of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.

140
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,697
She knows who orchestrated
the bombing?

141
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,765
That, my friend,
is exactly what you will find out.

142
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,978
Noor Abed Jazeem.

143
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,817
I'm going to ask you
some questions.

144
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,824
If you refuse to cooperate,
I'm going to hurt you.

145
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,055
Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid.

146
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,231
You of all people should know that.

147
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,562
What?

148
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,673
You don't remember me?

149
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,307
Am I so different from the girl
in the schoolyard

150
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,744
who used to push you in the mud?

151
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,181
- Nadia.
- And your mother would tell my mother,

152
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,053
"Why must you pick on little Sayid?"

153
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,920
And I'd answer,

154
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,722
"Because he ignores me."

155
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,456
You had enough attention,

156
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,195
with your family's wealth and...
your charm.

157
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,704
Such things matter little to children.

158
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,900
But then, you always were
older than your years,

159
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,444
weren't you, Sayid?

160
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,837
Not old enough to understand
that being pushed

161
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,349
was a sign of affection.

162
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,613
Now you're a traitor
to your country.

163
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,020
Tell me what you know
about the bombing, Nadia.

164
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,828
Tell me, or I swear
I will hurt you.

165
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,928
Hmm. Oh, I know, Sayid.

166
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,668
This is not my first interrogation
by the Republican Guard.

167
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,609
This is where they
burned me with acid.

168
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,772
They pierced my hands
with a drill.

169
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,975
Would you like to see
the soles of my feet?

170
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,450
Where they flayed the skin off?

171
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,545
These are handiworks of your friends.

172
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,285
The people you swear allegiance to.

173
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,661
If you were innocent, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,232
But this bombing
is a different matter.

175
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,106
- Nadia...
- Go on, Sayid.

176
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,607
Do your work.

177
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,839
I'm not going to
tell you anything.

178
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
Then I'm going to hurt you.

179
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,783
I know.

180
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,718
You have a bullet wound.

181
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,721
I was a soldier.

182
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,852
You were?

183
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,327
And are you still?

184
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,294
It was a long time ago.

185
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,334
Tell me more about her,
the woman. Nadia.

186
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,715
Alex... who is he?

187
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,022
I'm bored.
Can I take Vincent to the beach?

188
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,291
Um... I'll take you later.
I'm in the middle of something.

189
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,854
But there's nothing to do.

190
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,025
Well, you got to figure out
stuff to do.

191
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,695
You got to find a way
to entertain yourself.

192
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,499
Come on.

193
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,166
Come on. I know I saw it.

194
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,740
Yes.

195
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,469
- Hurley, uh...
- Hold on, man. I'm busy.

196
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,007
- Dude, can I borrow this?
- What?

197
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,780
- Thanks, man.
- What are you doing?

198
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,018
So you heard my transmission,

199
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,292
- Came looking for me, for answers.
- I didn't know you were alive.

200
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,662
- Still lying.
- I'm not lying.

201
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,466
Lies! Like this plane crash
that you survived.

202
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,564
- There were others?
- More than 40.

203
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,506
Then why are you alone?

204
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,677
- I left them.
- Why?

205
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,810
There was...

206
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,144
I did something.

207
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,119
Something I'm ashamed of.

208
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,592
And Nadia...

209
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,628
...you left her too?

210
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,967
She wasn't on the plane.

211
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,204
She's dead.

212
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,404
Because of me.

213
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,557
I'm so sorry.

214
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,010
I want to show you something.

215
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,213
See, this junction here

216
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,084
reroutes some of the spring's water flow
into suspended basins.

217
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,487
Pop in some holes,
you got showers.

218
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,923
You keep the drinking water separate.

219
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,257
This is... You drew this?

220
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,760
- I was an artist in a previous life.
- I thought you were in construction.

221
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,234
- I am. I mean I was. Long story.
- Hey, Jack!

222
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,704
Hurley's worked up about something.
Said we should see it.

223
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,975
Welcome...

224
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,015
...to the first and...

225
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,278
...hopefully last,

226
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,717
Island Open.

227
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,056
- What?
- It's two holes, for now.

228
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,991
- Three par, and no waiting.
- Hurley...

229
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,193
You built a golf course?

230
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,756
Rich idiots fly to tropical islands
to whack balls around.

231
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,166
All the stuff we got
to deal with, man,

232
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,431
this is what you've been
wasting time on?

233
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,372
Dudes, listen. Our lives suck.

234
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,671
Nerves are stretched to the max.

235
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,770
I mean, we're lost on an island,

236
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,476
running from boars and monsters...

237
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,486
- Freakin' polar bears!
- Polar bears?

238
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,545
You didn't hear
about the polar bear?

239
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,558
If we're stuck here, then just
surviving's not gonna cut it.

240
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,084
We need some kind of relief.
We need some way that we can...

241
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,925
...you know, have fun.
That's right, fun.

242
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,402
Or we're gonna go crazy, waiting
for the next bad thing to happen.

243
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,247
It's a music box,
but it's broken.

244
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,977
Has been...

245
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,646
...for a long time.

246
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,188
It was a gift from my love

247
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,951
for our anniversary.

248
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,015
You mean Alex.

249
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,061
Robert.

250
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,691
It was such a comfort to me
the first few years here.

251
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,395
I could fix it for you.

252
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,767
I could take a look at it
if you freed my hands.

253
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,882
I'm fairly good
with mechanical things.

254
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,953
I'll need my hands.

255
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,195
What is written on the back
of your photograph?

256
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,099
- What are you doing?
- Did she write it, or did you?

257
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,836
Perhaps you don't want to tell me
because it causes too much pain.

258
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,738
Rousseau...

259
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,582
You don't need to do that.

260
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,021
- This is a problem, man.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,658
I mean, I know what I'd do, but...

262
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,028
...it's gotta be your call.

263
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,206
Okay.

264
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,110
- Give me a 7 iron.
- Got it.

265
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,550
Hey!

266
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,780
Heads up over there!

267
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,520
- No chance!
- Don't blow it!

268
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,615
You won't
get anywhere near us!

269
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,689
Hey! Doc!

270
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,253
There you are.

271
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,391
Somebody said
you went this way.

272
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,766
Listen, that rash of mine
is starting to spread.

273
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,032
It's like the size of a grape...

274
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,472
What are you guys doing?

275
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,008
- Uh...
- Are you playing golf?

276
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,172
Yeah.

277
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,515
Can I play?

278
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,190
Sorry about the sedative.

279
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,463
It was the only safe way
for me to move you.

280
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,973
You offered to fix
my music box.

281
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,509
After all I've done to you.

282
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,205
Striking you, shocking you.

283
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,037
Why?

284
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,255
Do you want me to fix
your music box, or don't you?

285
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,920
Yes. Yes, please.

286
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,632
Then I want to know your name.

287
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,626
Your first name.

288
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,402
Danielle.

289
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,304
My name is Danielle.

290
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,475
And how did you come to be
on this island, Danielle?

291
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,228
We were part
of a science team.

292
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,926
A science team
armed with rifles.

293
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,200
- Was Robert on the team?
- Yes.

294
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,001
And Alex, was he, too?

295
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,135
Our vessel was three days
out of Tahiti

296
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,543
when our instruments malfunctioned.

297
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,807
It was night.

298
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,215
The storm...

299
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,212
The sounds...

300
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,387
The ship slammed into rocks,

301
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,893
ran aground,

302
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,429
the hull breached
beyond repair.

303
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,058
So...

304
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,499
...we made camp.

305
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,436
Dug out this temporary shelter.

306
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,972
Temporary.

307
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,909
Nearly two months
we survived here.

308
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,144
Two months before...

309
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,177
Your distress signal.
The message I heard.

310
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,383
You said "It killed them all."

311
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,364
We were coming back
from the black rock.

312
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,370
It was them.

313
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,337
They were the carriers.

314
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,507
Who were the carriers?

315
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,676
The others.

316
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,053
What others?

317
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,488
What is the black rock?

318
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,353
Have you seen other people
on this island?

319
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,952
No.

320
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,895
But I hear them.

321
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,293
Out there in the jungle.

322
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,833
They whisper.

323
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,040
You think I'm insane.

324
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,353
I think you've been alone
for too long.

325
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,241
I'm sorry.
This is all I could find.

326
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,578
I'll try and bring you
some fruit later on.

327
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,376
Are you ready to talk?

328
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,718
That depends on what you'd like
to talk about, Sayid.

329
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,818
Books?

330
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,087
Weather?

331
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,096
Since I've seen neither
locked in this cell for weeks,

332
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,598
I'm afraid my conversation
will suffer.

333
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,100
We have two suspects
in custody.

334
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,296
Have a look at these photographs.

335
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,932
All you need to do is nod.

336
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,976
If you prove you're willing
to cooperate,

337
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,204
I think I can get them to free you.

338
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,249
Then I won't have these visits
to look forward to anymore.

339
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,721
This isn't a game, Nadia.

340
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,853
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

341
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,632
Pretending to be something
I know you're not.

342
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:29,302
- You'll never believe this.
- You learned how to tie your shoes?

343
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,475
Funny. Someone at the caves
built a golf course.

344
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,314
- Are you high?
- Seriously, a golf course.

345
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,116
Jack's playing right now.

346
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,348
Jack?

347
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,289
- Is golfing?
- That's what I hear.

348
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,091
I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna check this out.

349
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,894
Wait for me, bonehead.

350
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,774
Doctor playing golf.

351
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,504
Whoo! Boy howdy,
now I've heard everything.

352
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:05,276
- What's next, cop eating a donut?
- If you want to come, you should say.

353
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,877
Think I'll pass on that, Freckles.
Not big on crowds.

354
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,888
And let's face it,
crowd's not too hot on me, either.

355
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:19,525
One outcast to another, I'd think
about making more of an effort.

356
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,166
Duly noted.

357
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,607
You see?

358
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,846
Some things can be fixed.

359
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,720
Thank you.

360
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,923
Thank you so much.

361
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,700
Thank you so much.

362
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,828
Danielle,

363
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,236
please let me go.

364
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,567
Go?

365
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,409
Back to the people
I told you about.

366
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,578
You can't. You have to stay.

367
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,416
- It's not safe.
- Not safe? What's not safe?

368
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,286
You need me. You can't leave.

369
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,551
Danielle.

370
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,466
Where are you going?

371
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,229
- If we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
- If we're lucky?

372
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,847
It might be
that thing out there.

373
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,744
The monster.

374
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,252
There's no such thing as monsters.

375
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,158
- You have to execute her.
- What?

376
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,289
The Jazeem woman
has given us nothing.

377
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,096
This will send a message
to others who will not talk.

378
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,830
I just need more time with her.

379
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,498
You have had more
than a month, Sayid.

380
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,508
Now bring her outside
and shoot her,

381
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,544
or I will.

382
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,639
Is this a problem?

383
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,842
No.

384
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,081
- It's not a problem.
- Good.

385
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,896
What did you bring me today?

386
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,840
Put it on.

387
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,009
Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?

388
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,784
Ugh!

389
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,193
- Dude, I think you stuck it.
- Lucky, lucky.

390
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,323
This thing have a ladies' team?

391
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,562
- Hey.
- Hey.

392
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,899
- When'd you show up?
- While ago.

393
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,106
I almost didn't recognize you.

394
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,403
You're smiling.

395
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,307
I have to watch that.

396
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,308
So, how'd you come up with this?

397
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,246
Wasn't me.
It was all Hurley.

398
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,611
I've been going crazy
to make everyone feel safe.

399
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,746
I haven't been sleeping
'cause I want everyone to feel safe.

400
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,619
He builds a golf course,

401
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,286
- And everyone feels safe.
- Aw, crap! Do-over.

402
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,762
It's a Mulligan.

403
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,890
A gentleman's sport.
You got to get the words right.

404
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,628
- Dad.
- Hey. Check this out.

405
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,102
- You want to...
- Let me.

406
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,604
- Get away!
- All right.

407
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,300
You left me alone at the caves.

408
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,137
What? I left you with Claire.

409
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,540
She's sleeping.

410
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,738
Oh, man, I'm... I'm sorry.

411
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,043
I just... I just got caught up.

412
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,448
I'm really sorry, Walt.
I screwed up.

413
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,680
I'll make it up to you.
Hey, you wanna play?

414
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,115
You're breathing out.
When you go up...

415
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,956
Nah. There's other people waiting.

416
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,588
They won't mind.
You want to take a swing?

417
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,393
Michael, it's your shot.

418
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,902
Okay, cool.
Uh, so we'll play later, okay?

419
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,431
Put the gun down, Danielle.

420
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,804
Put it down on the ground.

421
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,642
Don't.

422
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,491
I'll take it from here.

423
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,070
What... what's going on?

424
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,048
Forty meters outside this door,
there's a supply truck

425
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,108
that will be leaving.
They don't check them on the way out.

426
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,780
Only coming in. Get inside.

427
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,686
Cover yourself any way you can.

428
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,921
They won't reach the city for
30 minutes. That's enough time to hide.

429
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,759
Come with me.

430
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,856
I can't.

431
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,491
Desertion.

432
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,936
They would kill my family.

433
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,835
I don't have your courage.

434
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,400
You have more than you know.

435
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,079
Nadia, you have to go.

436
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,746
Sayid?

437
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,114
What are you doing?

438
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,560
Don't.

439
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,331
- Guard!

440
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,797
Sayid! Now you have to come
with me! They'll kill you!

441
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,901
No. You escaped, you stole my gun,
and you shot him.

442
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,076
And then you shot me.

443
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,346
Sayid!

444
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,790
Take it.

445
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,353
Please, Nadia.

446
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,365
Take it and go.

447
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,655
Please,
I don't wish to hurt you.

448
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,791
You already have.

449
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,926
Don't.

450
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,637
The firing pin
has been removed.

451
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,231
Robert didn't notice
it was missing, either,

452
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,006
when I shot him.

453
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,272
- But you loved him.
- He was sick.

454
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,646
Sick?

455
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,009
It took them...

456
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,578
...one after the other.

457
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,792
I had no choice.

458
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,658
They were already lost.

459
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,926
- You killed them.
- What would have happened

460
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,366
if we were rescued?

461
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,927
I couldn't let that happen.

462
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,529
I won't!

463
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,004
I'm not sick.

464
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,443
I know.

465
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,580
Then why kill me?

466
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,785
I can't let you go.

467
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,249
Don't you understand?

468
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,886
To have someone to talk to...

469
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,254
...to touch.

470
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,369
"You'll find me in the next life,

471
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,406
if not in this one."

472
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,164
What?

473
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,269
The writing on the back
of Nadia's photograph.

474
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,209
I know what it's like
to hold on to someone.

475
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:40,185
I've been holding on for seven years
to just a thought.

476
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,490
A blind hope that somewhere
she's still alive.

477
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,859
But the more I hold on,

478
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,234
the more I pull away
from those around me.

479
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,208
The only way off this...

480
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,780
...this place, is with their help.

481
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,531
Come with me.

482
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,297
You don't have to be
alone, Danielle.

483
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,657
Your people,

484
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,633
the ones you're determined
to get back to.

485
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,465
Watch them.

486
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,832
Watch them closely.

487
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,741
Danielle!

488
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,919
Who is Alex?

489
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,524
Alex was my child.

490
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,409
Guys, please.

491
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,779
I've never made par
on a course before.

492
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,116
- Ah! No!
- Dude, you were robbed.

493
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,183
Bollocks! See that?

494
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,922
Okay, Jack, it's up to you.

495
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:01,828
Sink this, you get the blazer.

496
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,526
No pressure.

497
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:05,569
Yeah, no pressure.

498
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,441
Five bucks says he sinks it.

499
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,940
- You betting against me?
- Sorry, dude,

500
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:21,416
- But you're a duffer like me.
- Make it ten.

501
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,454
I don't have any cash,
but I'll bet my dinner on the doc.

502
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,682
Oh!

503
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:29,886
I got two tubes of sunscreen
and a flashlight says he chokes.

504
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,629
I'll take that action.

505
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,308
Yeah, me too.

506
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,107
You just bet on Jack, dumbass.

507
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,977
We need the sunscreen, princess.

508
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,975
Does your father
know you're here?

509
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,874
Can you teach me how to do that?
