1
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:38,824
Ow! Son of a bitch!

2
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,396
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

3
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,530
- You practically busted my knee.
- Are you stalking me now?

4
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,302
Stalking you?
I was protecting you.

5
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,275
From what, Southern perverts?

6
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,505
Yeah, whatever.

7
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,447
- I can't believe you.
- It's not that bad.

8
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,417
It's my knee.
I'll tell you how bad it is.

9
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,218
What the hell are you doing
all the way out here?

10
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,850
This is the only place
the trees aren't picked clean.

11
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,121
You shouldn't be here alone,
not after...

12
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,789
No, I'm fine.
I can take care of myself.

13
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,561
Oh, of course.
"I don't need protecting.

14
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,602
I can take care of myself.

15
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,467
- Me Kate. Me throw rock."
- Shh.

16
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,207
What, you smell blood
on the wind?

17
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,506
You don't hear that?

18
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,260
What are you doing?

19
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,664
I need to soak my sore knee.

20
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,435
Come on, Freckles.

21
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,636
After all we've been through
on this damn island,

22
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,074
don't we deserve something good?

23
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,112
What, you're gonna say no?

24
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,513
Are you some sort of navel-gazing,
no-fun, mopey type?

25
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,156
Well.

26
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,365
It's chilly. Come on, girl!

27
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,163
Whoo-hoo!

28
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,368
It's nice, huh?

29
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,980
Come on, let's go to the rock.

30
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,058
Hey, are you okay?

31
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,493
Yeah. You?

32
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,223
Yeah. I'm gonna go check 'em out.

33
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,267
- Check 'em out for what?
- See what they got on 'em.

34
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,766
Sawyer!

35
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,597
Hey! Got myself a wallet.

36
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,799
- You're disgusting.
- He ain't gonna miss it.

37
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,933
Help me with that case.

38
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,877
Oh, I'm disgusting,
but you're not?

39
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:48,641
It's mine.

40
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,142
You wouldn't happen to have
your key on you, would you?

41
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,303
That case ain't yours, is it?

42
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,878
No.

43
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,676
Well.

44
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,978
You wouldn't mind if I just...

45
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,212
- Take it.
- I don't care.

46
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,052
That's not what it looks like.

47
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,802
Something you want to tell me
about this suitcase?

48
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,278
Take it.

49
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:54,070
Everything is washing out to sea!

50
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,937
This can't be normal.

51
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,999
The tide shifting so suddenly.

52
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,602
Rising in so short a time.

53
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,840
There's a lot not normal around here.

54
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,509
The rate this beach is eroding,

55
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,280
the fuselage is going to
be underwater in days.

56
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,016
We need to get all this stuff
off the beach before nightfall.

57
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,786
I hope moving up the coast
will make a difference.

58
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,387
It'd make a difference
if everyone moved inland.

59
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,762
I think you'll find people
slightly wary of entering the jungle

60
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,994
after what happened
to the pregnant girl,

61
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,037
not to mention
whatever that thing is.

62
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,867
Sayid...

63
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,705
I need you to take me back
to the French woman, Rousseau.

64
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,335
Claire's still out there.

65
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:36,108
Now, Rousseau mentioned
that there are...

66
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,514
...others on this island.
- Her mind is gone.

67
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,279
- You heard them.
- I don't know.

68
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,082
- You said that you...
- The wind.

69
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,182
It was the wind playing tricks.

70
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,420
Then what about the papers
that you took from her then?

71
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,225
Documents, maps. Isn't there...

72
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,200
I'm skilled at mathematics, but these
are beyond anything I've ever seen.

73
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,137
There are these notes in French
accompanying the maps and diagrams.

74
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,142
If I could translate them, I might be
able to make sense of it, but...

75
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,678
What?

76
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:09,806
Perhaps some things
are best left untranslated.

77
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,008
Yeah?

78
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,210
Maybe you should tell him that.

79
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,332
You're doing something productive.

80
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,771
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

81
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,674
You and Locke have been leaving before
sunrise and coming back after dark.

82
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,939
What are you doing out there?

83
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,280
Is he your new boyfriend?

84
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,981
- We're looking for Claire.
- I thought there was no trail,

85
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,790
- That no one knew where to look.
- Yeah, at least I'm doing something.

86
00:09:56,862 --> 00:10:00,093
Don't you see the way they look at us?
We're a joke.

87
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,061
I'm trying to contribute something.

88
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,229
And you're just...
you're useless.

89
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,746
Okay, Miss Ryan,
if you'll just give me some ID,

90
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,282
we'll get started
on your loan app.

91
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,875
Okay. Here you go.

92
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,218
So, what brings you
to New Mexico?

93
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,780
- My work.
- What line of work is that?

94
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,226
- I'm a photographer.
- What do you photograph?

95
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,786
I've been commissioned
for a coffee table book.

96
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,834
Pictures of old theaters
in small towns.

97
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,994
There's a fantastic one
down in Ruidoso.

98
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,265
You can't miss it.
It's off the main road.

99
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,799
I'll have to make sure I give you
an acknowledgement, Mr... Hutton.

100
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,401
Mark.

101
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,174
Everyone down on the ground now!

102
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,944
Don't even think about it!
Let's go!

103
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,010
Shut up and move over there!
Let's go!

104
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,150
- Who's back there? I see you!
- Big boy, get your ass down there!

105
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,326
Get out! Let's go!

106
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,089
All right! Hold it right there!

107
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,124
All right, girlie, get up
and get over there! Let's go! Move!

108
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,828
Stay there!
Get down on the ground, bitch!

109
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,569
Are you the manager?

110
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,937
- I said, are you the manager?
- Yes.

111
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,275
Good. Now let's open
the money cage now

112
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,244
before people start getting killed.

113
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,941
Don't look at me!
Look at the floor!

114
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,210
Down right now!

115
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,445
I said, down!

116
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,451
Gotcha.

117
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,953
Get off of me.

118
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,852
I hate to bicker about positions,

119
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,187
but I think
you're the one on top.

120
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,293
Maybe you're not here
for the case at all.

121
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,695
Ow!

122
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:49,957
Woman!

123
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,140
If you wanted to play rough,
all you had to do was say so.

124
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,242
You wanna try for it again?

125
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,544
Give it to me.

126
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,849
No.

127
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,519
We're quite close to the equator.

128
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,155
The sun might be stronger
than what you're used to.

129
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,131
I have a pretty good base.

130
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,635
There was a matter
I was going to ask you about.

131
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,042
- What?
- I need a favor.

132
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,711
I need your help translating papers
I took from Rousseau.

133
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,813
- Who's Rousseau?
- The Frenchwoman.

134
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,222
The distress call we intercepted.

135
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,732
- Did my brother put you up to this?
- Your brother?

136
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,603
No.

137
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,835
The papers contain equations
with notations in French.

138
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,539
- If I can understand the notations...
- Sorry, I can't do it.

139
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,680
You're the only person
who speaks French.

140
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,378
- I barely speak French.
- Please, Shannon.

141
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,013
Can you at least try?

142
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,688
Son of a bitch.

143
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,732
You're wasting your time, man.

144
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,160
If you pick the lock on a Halliburton,
I'll put you on my back and fly.

145
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,798
You better find yourself
a runway, daddy,

146
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,342
'cause there ain't
a lock I can't pick.

147
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,971
- What's he trying to do?
- Pick the lock on a Halliburton.

148
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,107
Good luck.

149
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,713
The only way you're gonna open that case
is with pure force, impact velocity.

150
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,726
- What's that mean?
- You gotta hit it with something hard

151
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,958
like a sledgehammer.
Or the axe.

152
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,570
- You got it.
- Yeah.

153
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,813
Right there.

154
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,943
Isn't there an easier way
to get there?

155
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,612
The easiest way
isn't always the best.

156
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,851
- Did anybody see you take it?
- No.

157
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,552
- I don't think so.
- Well, which is it?

158
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,094
Sorry?

159
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,323
"No," or "I don't think so"?

160
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,228
- No.
- Good. Let's get to work.

161
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,269
Hello, Charlie.

162
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,143
Oh, that's right.

163
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,775
You're not talking much
these days.

164
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,376
But it doesn't mean
you get to be rude.

165
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,449
Excuse me?

166
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,013
Everybody else

167
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,152
is helping us
move the camp up the beach,

168
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,095
- Except for you.
- Are you serious?

169
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,133
You think you're the only one
with something to be sad about?

170
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,295
I got sob stories for you,
so why don't you grab

171
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,532
the other end of this thing
and help me?

172
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,142
Well?

173
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,020
Come on.

174
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,095
Come on.

175
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,305
Impact velocity...

176
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,213
Physics, my ass.

177
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,516
All right.

178
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,057
Son of a...

179
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,789
Unbelievable.

180
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,560
Hey!

181
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,701
Hey!

182
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,295
Don't even think about it.

183
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,608
Hey! Damn it.

184
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,809
Hell, Freckles, I knew you wanted it.
I just didn't know how bad.

185
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,471
Whoa!

186
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,107
You're gonna have to come up
with a new move.

187
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,673
Ah! God.

188
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,878
Okay. Okay!

189
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,081
Okay, this is just silly.

190
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,425
Hold on.
I got a proposition for you.

191
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,462
You tell me what's inside,
and I'll give it to you.

192
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,996
Are you serious?

193
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,864
Hell, no way
to open the damn thing.

194
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,132
At this point, all I care about
is satisfying my own curiosity.

195
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:05,976
Oh! Easy, sweetheart.
I don't really care what it is.

196
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,606
What's burning me up
is why it means so much to you.

197
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,681
Last chance.

198
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,226
All right.

199
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,701
Give me the key now.

200
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,261
I'm tired of asking nice.

201
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,807
Give me the money cage key now.

202
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,934
You're going to kill me.
Why would I...

203
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,479
You think we're having
a conversation here? Huh?

204
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,811
Everybody be cool!
Do you wanna go home?

205
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:47,113
Don't look at me! Look at the floor!
Everybody calm. Stay down.

206
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,313
Listen to me, I am not
gonna ask you again.

207
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,821
I want that key!

208
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,153
- I can take him.
- What?

209
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,557
The tall guy,
he's not watching us.

210
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,425
It's now or never.
Keep your head down.

211
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,059
Hey! Watch out!

212
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:06,365
Pick it up!

213
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,870
Pick it up!
Shoot him!

214
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,635
What's wrong? Shoot!

215
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,406
- Cover him!
- Shoot him!

216
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:18,142
- Shoot him! Turn off the safety!
- Gimme that gun.

217
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,481
It's on the side! Turn it off!

218
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,043
I don't know how to use a gun!

219
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,448
You wanna get shot, fat boy? Huh?

220
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,028
- Okay little hero.
- No, please, don't.

221
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,360
Shut up! Let's you and me go talk.

222
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,731
Huh? Right in here. Let's go.

223
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,341
"I don't know how to use a gun"?

224
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,347
- That's classic.
- Yeah.

225
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,766
You never said anything
about math.

226
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,746
You worry about the French.
I'll take care of the math.

227
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,417
I can't do this.

228
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,354
If you really put your mind to it,
I know you can.

229
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,958
Where did you learn
to speak French?

230
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,156
I knew this guy.

231
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,735
- This guy?
- In France, in St. Tropez.

232
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,931
I kind of lived there for a while.

233
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,138
Well, they say that is the best way
to learn a foreign language.

234
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,075
All right.

235
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,152
Let me see.

236
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:10,519
So...

237
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,128
Uh...

238
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,224
What is this?
What is it for?

239
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:26,602
A headache.

240
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,476
Oh. Cool.

241
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:31,482
All right.

242
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,539
Jack.

243
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:39,112
- We got a problem.
- We have a problem, or...

244
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,253
...you have a problem?

245
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,463
Jack, you're the only one
who knows about me.

246
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,133
Before I left for Sydney,

247
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,338
the marshal who was escorting me,
he had this silver case.

248
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,040
The airline wouldn't let him
bring it on the plane.

249
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,415
It was hard enough trying
to convince them to let him wear a gun.

250
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,717
But the case,
they made him check it.

251
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,257
What was in the case?

252
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,590
Some traveling money.
Some of his personal stuff.

253
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,128
And four 9 millimeters
with a few boxes of ammo.

254
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,293
- Guns.
- Guns.

255
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:35,276
- So, where is the case now?
- Sawyer has it.

256
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,008
Uh-huh.

257
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,482
- He hasn't been able to open it.
- Lucky for us.

258
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,111
He will. Sooner or later.

259
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,220
So, what do you need me to do?

260
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,454
I know where the key is. He...

261
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,598
The marshal kept it
in his wallet,

262
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,635
in his back pocket.

263
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,307
- I buried him, Kate.
- I know.

264
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,470
Where?

265
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,715
- So, what else is in the case?
- What?

266
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,549
What else is in the case?

267
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,316
Nothing.

268
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,994
- That's the truth?
- Just the guns.

269
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:34,030
If you want my help,

270
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,107
we're gonna open
the case together.

271
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,840
Okay.

272
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,948
Okay.

273
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,312
- Why are you smiling?
- Am I?

274
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,949
You look happy.

275
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,686
Well, I guess I must be then.

276
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,828
There's no reason.
Things are awful.

277
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,695
- They're not awful.
- We're stranded on an island.

278
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,633
- No one's coming for us.
- You don't know that.

279
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,536
Well, what I do know

280
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,507
is there's something in that jungle
that eats people.

281
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,705
Just because we've not heard from it
doesn't mean it won't get hungry again.

282
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:18,875
And I know there's a person or people
that are trying to hurt us.

283
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,508
- Charlie.
- And...

284
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,616
Nobody blames you.

285
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,121
What?

286
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,817
For what happened to Claire.

287
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,326
It's not your fault.

288
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,124
You did everything
that you could do,

289
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,496
and you came very close
to dying yourself.

290
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,163
Yeah.

291
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,537
Maybe I should have died.

292
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:46,202
You know what I think, Charlie?

293
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,578
You need to ask for help.

294
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,843
Who's gonna help me?

295
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,752
So why didn't you
put him with the others?

296
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,521
When you burned the fuselage?

297
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,465
Because I needed to bury him.

298
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,442
- So you ready to do this?
- Hell, yeah.

299
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,678
By now their imaginations
are running wild.

300
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,721
Don't hold back. He won't talk
if the details are off.

301
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,553
You and your details, Maggie.

302
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,287
- Okay, hero.
- No, please, don't.

303
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,299
Shut up!
Everybody just relax!

304
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,865
- I said quiet.
- Okay, Mr. Manager,

305
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,428
you want to be a hard-ass?

306
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,100
Protect a vault that doesn't
even belong to you?

307
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,373
Okay.
There's gonna be consequences.

308
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,246
- He's gonna kill me anyway.
- I swear, if you don't shut up.

309
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,183
You got three seconds
to give me that damn key.

310
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,188
One...

311
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,884
Two...

312
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,290
- Three.
- All right.

313
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,760
I'll give it to you.

314
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,299
Good. Let's go.

315
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,232
Right around here.

316
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,769
Let's go.

317
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,122
- You all right?
- Compared to what?

318
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,190
- You want me to...
- No. I'll do it.

319
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,962
Oh, God.

320
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,580
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

321
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,879
Oh!

322
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,516
Oh!

323
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,356
Oh.

324
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,568
The key isn't in here.

325
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,769
It isn't?

326
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,980
That was real good sleight of hand
distracting me with the wallet.

327
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,687
Open it.

328
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,435
- Jack...
- Don't.

329
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,600
Don't.

330
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,143
Um...

331
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,392
"The sea of sparkles?"
No, wait. Um...

332
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,055
"The sea of silver sparkles
that change."

333
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,365
- It's the same as the last one.
- Are you sure?

334
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,437
The equation is different.
It doesn't relate.

335
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,998
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

336
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,405
Okay.

337
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,503
What about this one?

338
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,741
It should say something
about latitude.

339
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,580
- Something about the stars.
- Give me some room.

340
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,248
Um...

341
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,813
"Next to the pond... blue..."

342
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:57,453
Uh..."Blue eternity."

343
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,560
No, wait, no. Um, "Blue infinity."

344
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,862
- "Blue infinity"?
- "Blue infinity."

345
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,062
There's something about this
that is so familiar.

346
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,130
You've been telling me what sounds
very much like nonsense

347
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,802
for the past hour,
and now it seems familiar?

348
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:16,847
Okay, A: I told you
that my French sucks.

349
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:20,009
And B: This isn't
my nonsense, okay?

350
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:24,180
Do you ever think that after 16 years
on Mystery Frickin' Island,

351
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,019
your friend might not be
quite adjusted?

352
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,019
This was a mistake.

353
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,360
Yeah.

354
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,459
Haven't you heard?
I'm completely useless.

355
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,975
Sawyer?

356
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,114
Doctor.

357
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,156
So, what can I do you for?

358
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,228
Figured she'd get you
to do her dirty work for her.

359
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,787
So, what?
We gonna wrestle for it?

360
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,731
No, you're gonna give it to me.

361
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,701
- Am I?
- Yeah.

362
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,329
I'm just gonna give it to you?

363
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,895
Yeah.

364
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,841
- Why would I want to do that?
- Cephalexin.

365
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,642
Yeah? Go on.

366
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:26,150
That's the antibiotic I'm giving you
for the knife wound in your arm.

367
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:30,153
You're in the middle of a cycle.
If I keep giving you the pills,

368
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,712
you're gonna be
as right as rain.

369
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,554
But I'm gonna stop
giving you the pills.

370
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,687
For two days you're gonna
think you're all good.

371
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,788
Then it's gonna start to itch.

372
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,727
The day after, the fever will come
and you'll see red lines

373
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:48,329
running up and down your arm.
Day or two after that...

374
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,569
...you'll beg me to take the case
just to cut off your arm.

375
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,139
That's a nice story, Jack.

376
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,547
And even if it were true,

377
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,879
I don't think you could do it.

378
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,089
You're wrong.

379
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,762
She tell you what's inside?

380
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,760
Yeah, me neither.

381
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,804
Hope you got yourself some jaws of life
back in Cave Town.

382
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,241
That's what it's gonna take
to pop this bitch.

383
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,677
I'll figure something out.

384
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:34,613
I know you think
you're doing her a favor,

385
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,849
but however she talked you
into doing this,

386
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,583
she lied, brother.

387
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,668
Jack?

388
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,339
We're gonna do this together.

389
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,851
- Why?
- Because that's what I said we'd do.

390
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,021
What are you waiting for?
Open the damn thing!

391
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,928
Hell, now we're talking.
Don't move.

392
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,994
- Please don't. I...
- Shut up.

393
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,675
I let you in.
Now please let the girl go.

394
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,680
Let the girl go?

395
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,316
Man, you have no idea, do you?

396
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,190
The girl is the one
who set you up.

397
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:54,220
The girl picked this bank.
Picked this vault.

398
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,459
This whole thing
is the girl's idea.

399
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:03,730
- What are you doing?
- Easy, Maggie.

400
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:05,469
Just cleaning up after myself.

401
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,173
Hey!

402
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,646
You shoot, I shoot.

403
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,481
- Wait. What?
- I said no one gets hurt.

404
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,815
I know you're cold, baby.

405
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,520
But you're not that cold.

406
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,394
What the hell is going on here?

407
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,528
- You shot me, you stupid bitch!
- Shut up, Jason.

408
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,435
I told you not to trust her!

409
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,407
I need the key
to safety deposit box 850 now.

410
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,377
- Who are you?
- The key to the box now.

411
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,846
You need two keys,
the bank's and...

412
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,940
If you had the customer key, why...

413
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,609
I'm not on the signatory card.

414
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:50,279
You put me up to this
to get into a safe deposit box?

415
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,084
I swear to God,
you better kill me,

416
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,786
- 'cause if you don't...
- My name's not Maggie. Now go.

417
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,671
Anything you want to tell me?

418
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,978
All right then.

419
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,984
Is this it?

420
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,353
Is this what you wanted?

421
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,410
What is it?

422
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,550
- It's nothing.
- What is it, Kate?

423
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,890
You wouldn't understand.

424
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,793
I want the truth.

425
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,163
Just this once. What is it?

426
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,060
- It belonged to the man I loved.
- The truth.

427
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,969
It belonged
to the man I loved!

428
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,530
Stop lying to me!
The truth!

429
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,577
It belonged to the man I killed!

430
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,077
Your husband was in
the tail section of the plane.

431
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,176
Yes, he was.

432
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,255
But he'll be back.

433
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,289
You think he's still alive?

434
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,419
I know he is.

435
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,661
How?

436
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,291
I just do.

437
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,897
It's a fine line
between denial and faith.

438
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:07,000
It's much better on my side.

439
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,696
Help me.

440
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,561
Baby...

441
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,335
I'm not the one
that can help you.

442
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,544
Heavenly father,

443
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,218
we thank you.

444
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:57,256
We thank you for bringing us
together tonight.

445
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,130
And we ask,

446
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,998
that you show Charlie the path...

447
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,928
The guy from St. Tropez,

448
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,933
he had this kid.

449
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,097
A real snot, who hated me.

450
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,606
His name was Laurent.

451
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,974
He watched this movie
over and over and over again

452
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:51,173
every day, all day,
like kids do, 900 times.

453
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,773
It was the cartoon about fish.

454
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,984
You know,
one of the computer ones.

455
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,988
Why are you telling me this?

456
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,080
The movie was dubbed in French,

457
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,457
and at the end,
there was this song.

458
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,894
Those notations,
they're song lyrics.

459
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,957
And your French woman,

460
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,798
she's just like Laurent,

461
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,430
'cause she wrote them
over and over again.

462
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,507
What's the song?
