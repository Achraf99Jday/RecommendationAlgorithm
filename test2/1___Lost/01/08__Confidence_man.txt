<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,468
Did you say something to my boy?

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,603
- I need to talk to you.
- You speak English?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,808
My husband doesn't know.
He has a bad temper.

5
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,180
I need your help.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,549
Where are you?
Where are you?

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,178
Where are you?

8
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,353
Hell of a book.

9
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,436
It's about bunnies.

10
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:16,603
You must be cold without your trunks.

11
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,439
You bet.

12
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,378
How about you come a little closer
and warm me up?

13
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,015
You sure know how to make
a girl feel special, Sawyer.

14
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:33,520
You're incredible, Sawyer.

15
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,730
I love you.

16
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,871
Look at you.

17
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,608
What do you want?

18
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,544
Right now.

19
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,253
How could I want anything else?

20
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,296
- Uh-oh, baby.
- "Uh-oh," what?

21
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,735
- I thought you had a meeting.
- Yeah, but it's not until 3:30.

22
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,932
Baby, it's 3:28.

23
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,734
Damn it.

24
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,610
Damn it.
Baby, why don't you just...

25
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,512
Just go. You go, okay?

26
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,451
I'll stay here, order room service,
get fat...

27
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,887
Why don't you order
a chocolate sundae.

28
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,052
When I get back,
I'll use you as a dish.

29
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,532
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

30
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,203
What're you doing in my stuff, son?

31
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,236
This is gonna hurt.

32
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,638
Ow.

33
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,749
Ready to tell me what happened?

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,381
We were trying to find the source
of the distress call.

35
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,051
I saw the flare from the beach

36
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,152
and then the flare from
Sawyer's position in the jungle.

37
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,926
I switched on my antenna,

38
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,490
activated the transceiver...

39
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,929
...and then darkness.

40
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,464
Whoever hit me came from behind.

41
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,477
- They destroyed the equipment?
- Yes.

42
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,211
We're gonna figure this out.
But don't...

43
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,583
I will do what I need to do
to find the man responsible.

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,985
We need some help over here!

45
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,601
What happened?

46
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,832
Sawyer.

47
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,758
Morning delivery.

48
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,565
Aw, you're sweet. Thanks.

49
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,404
Well, I figured in your condition,
with the extra baggage, you know.

50
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,275
- Well, I can still walk.
- Barely.

51
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,372
Anyway, I worry about you out here.

52
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,747
You know, it's very sunny.

53
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,342
Thus my hat.

54
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,548
You know, there's plenty
of hats in the caves.

55
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,955
And we got a doctor.
That'll come in handy.

56
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,552
- I like the beach, Charlie.
- Yeah.

57
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,962
Who wouldn't want to spend the day
with sand fleas?

58
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:36,627
I want to be here.
For when we get rescued.

59
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,872
When we get rescued.

60
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,965
Right.

61
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,915
Ow! Jack, it's fine.
It's just a scrape.

62
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,751
Yeah, lots of scrapes today.

63
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,821
I'm running out of peroxide.

64
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,055
- He just jumped me, man.
- Why?

65
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,090
- Shannon has asthma.
- Asthma?

66
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,205
- Never seen her have an attack.
- She had an inhaler.

67
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,263
She sneaks hits
when no one's looking.

68
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,969
She's been embarrassed about it
since she was a kid.

69
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,638
Guess breathing's not cool.

70
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,773
- Had an inhaler?
- It ran out a couple days ago.

71
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,444
But I had four refills,
enough for a couple months.

72
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,352
She forgets her medication,
so I put it in my suitcase.

73
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,118
<i>Today I see that jackass reading
Watership Down. </i>

74
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,217
- You're losing me.
- It was in my bags, stuff I checked.

75
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,159
If he has my book,
he has my luggage.

76
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,131
If he has the luggage,
he has the inhalers.

77
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,731
Her breathing got really
rough today, man.

78
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,868
If she has an attack,
it's not gonna be good.

79
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,821
Where is it?

80
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,257
Hey, doc.
Long time, no see.

81
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,850
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

82
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,419
The girl's asthma medicine.

83
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,364
- Shannon. Her inhalers.
- Oh, that.

84
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,766
You attacked a kid
for helping his sister.

85
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,203
No, I whooped a thief because
he was going through my stuff...

86
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,036
- Yours?
...which I had to move.

87
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,441
You take something out of a suitcase
and that makes it yours?

88
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:30,073
I don't know what kind of commie
share-fest you're running in Cave Town,

89
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,549
but down here,
possession's nine-tenths.

90
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,451
- Man's got a right to protect property.
- Get up.

91
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,417
- Why? You wanna see who's taller?
- Get up!

92
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,394
- Sure you wanna make this your problem?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

93
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,889
Hey.

94
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,094
What's going on here?

95
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,806
You told me you were going
to Baton Rouge to close a deal.

96
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,318
Just trust me.
There isn't any time to explain.

97
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,081
I'm already late.

98
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,216
If I miss this meeting,
the whole deal's a bust, all right?

99
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,021
That's everything I have, $140,000.

100
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,697
There's an oil mining operation in
the Gulf of Mexico, drilling platforms.

101
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,672
$300,000 buys you one share.

102
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:32,643
But as soon as you invest,
a government-sponsored fund kicks in

103
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,943
and triples your money in two weeks.
Triples it.

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,449
- Three hundred thousand?
- Yeah.

105
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,113
- You got 140.
- I found an investor in Toronto.

106
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,780
He wants in, 50-50.

107
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,984
In two weeks, we'll be splitting
almost a million bucks.

108
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:51,120
Jess, this is my chance.

109
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,393
There's another option.

110
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,131
Yeah? And what's that?

111
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,902
That I give you the 160,000
and we split the profit.

112
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:08,345
Yeah? And how in the hell are you
gonna scare up 160,000 bucks?

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,773
My husband.

114
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,816
I'm gonna kill him.

115
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,344
- That won't help us get the medicine.
- But it'll feel good.

116
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,653
So, what's stopping you?

117
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:24,694
We're not savages, Kate.
Not yet.

118
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,730
Let me talk to Sawyer.

119
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,262
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to you?

120
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,464
- He says we have a connection.

121
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,802
- Do you?
- Please.

122
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,721
What do you want?

123
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,762
- Excuse me?
- What do you want, Sawyer?

124
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:06,065
Freckles, I got so many answers
to that question,

125
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,368
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

126
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,376
What do you want for the inhalers?

127
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,275
Oh.

128
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,838
Good question.
Hang on a tick.

129
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,744
What do I want?

130
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,021
A kiss ought to do it.

131
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,583
- What?
- A kiss.

132
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,629
From you. Right now.

133
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,564
I don't buy it.

134
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,463
- Buy what?
- The act.

135
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,765
You try too hard, Sawyer.

136
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:48,240
I ask you to help a woman who can't
breathe and you want me to kiss you?

137
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,709
Nobody's that disgusting.

138
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,753
I've seen you, you know.

139
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,257
- Seen me what?
- With that piece of paper.

140
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,317
The one you keep in your pocket.

141
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,694
I've seen the expression
on your face when you read it.

142
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:10,498
How carefully you fold it up.
It means something to you.

143
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,663
So you can play games
all you want,

144
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,799
but I know there's a human being
in there somewhere.

145
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,537
Give me the medication.

146
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,103
- You think you understand me?
- Yeah.

147
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,842
- I think I have...
- Shut up!

148
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,547
Wanna know what kind
of human being I am?

149
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,314
Read it.

150
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,327
Read it. Out loud.

151
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,363
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,

152
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,342
you don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

153
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,004
and I know what you've done.

154
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,747
You had sex with my mother,

155
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,311
and then you stole
my dad's money all away.

156
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:09,225
So he got angry,
and he killed my mother.

157
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,156
And then he killed himself too."

158
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,392
Don't stop now.

159
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,628
You're getting to the good part.

160
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,297
"All I know is your name.

161
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,776
But one of these days I'll find you
and give you this letter,

162
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,644
so you'll remember
what you done to me.

163
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,512
You killed my parents, Mr. Sawyer."

164
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,590
Now, about that kiss.

165
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,739
I didn't think so.

166
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:15,892
Locke.

167
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,727
Where were you last night,
around sunset?

168
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,199
Well, I'm afraid the only
witness to my whereabouts is the boar

169
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,137
that I was skinning for our dinner.

170
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,834
I heard you were trying
to send out a distress call?

171
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,208
So it would seem whoever
attacked you has a reason

172
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,338
for not wanting to get off the island.

173
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,149
Maybe someone who is profiting
from our current circumstances?

174
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,488
And from what I've seen,
you and Mr. Sawyer

175
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,584
share a certain animosity.

176
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,720
No, he has an alibi.

177
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,288
Just before I was struck,
he set off a bottle rocket,

178
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,096
a signal we'd worked out,
two kilometers away.

179
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,194
He couldn't have had the time...

180
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,139
Unless he found a way to time-delay
the fuse on his rocket.

181
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,504
- How could he...?
- Anyone who watches television

182
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,276
knows how to improvise a slow fuse.

183
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,243
Use a cigarette.

184
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,692
Just in case there's a next time.

185
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,211
Just try to breathe.
Breathe.

186
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,682
Come on, Shannon, work with me.

187
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,165
Give me the inhalers.

188
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,564
Now.

189
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,936
Hell, I was wondering when you
were gonna stop asking nice.

190
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,352
Well, it's about time, cowboy.

191
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,048
I've been telling you since day one
we're in the wild.

192
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,251
Didn't think you had it in you.

193
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,996
Is that all you got?

194
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,128
I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

195
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,325
Why not?

196
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,632
Because business between friends
is always a little sticky.

197
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,904
I don't know you well,
but I know your wife,

198
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,171
working with her
at the auto dealership.

199
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,178
I'm just not sure I'm comfortable.

200
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,238
Louisiana will invest two-thirds
of the drilling cost.

201
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,477
What is this, a loophole?

202
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,146
Look, David, you're reluctant.
I get it.

203
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:31,621
You got your lumberyard,
you don't need this.

204
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,126
- We should do this.
- Jess, I don't even know this guy.

205
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,786
Show him the cash.

206
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,871
- How do I know this is real?
- The money?

207
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,336
Hell, how about you
hold on to it for a night.

208
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,812
Check it out.

209
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,475
I want you to feel secure.

210
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,691
You know what?
Let's not do this.

211
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,196
I've got another investor
who's committed.

212
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,164
That should cover lunch.

213
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,497
And I'll see you Monday.

214
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,866
- David.
- David.

215
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,666
Wait.

216
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,036
Warm, fluffy towels.

217
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,103
Your turn.

218
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,172
Uh...

219
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,551
- Banoffi pie.
- You already said that.

220
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,146
Toffee and cream. Mmm.

221
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,885
Is food the only thing that you miss?

222
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,895
You're pregnant.
I mean, do you not crave anything?

223
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,421
Pickles? Fried ice cream?
Chocolate...

224
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,365
Peanut butter.

225
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,997
I'm the only Australian
who loves peanut butter.

226
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,439
I can get you peanut butter.

227
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,341
- Yeah. Sure you can.
- Yes, I can.

228
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,744
When I get you peanut butter,
you vacate this shore of depression

229
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,045
and move to the caves.

230
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,648
Deal?

231
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,552
Deal.

232
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,892
- Help! She's not breathing!

233
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,896
The attacks are getting worse.

234
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,829
Shannon? Listen to me.

235
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,594
Look at me.
Look at me.

236
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,569
You need to listen now.
This isn't just the asthma.

237
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,537
It's anxiety. It's in your head.
Yes.

238
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:31,042
You know that your medicine's
run out, and you're panicking.

239
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,772
Shannon. Look at me.
But we can fight this.

240
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,440
Together. Okay?

241
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,143
Nod your head, Shannon.
Good.

242
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,414
- Breathe in...
- She needs her inhaler.

243
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,116
- Breathe in through the nose. Slowly.

244
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,920
No, no, no. In through the nose.
Like this.

245
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,925
You can do this, Shannon.
You can do it.

246
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,430
- In through the nose.

247
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,472
You got your breath.
Yeah, your color's coming back.

248
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,136
See? I knew you could do this.

249
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,442
- Do you feel it? It's passing.
- Yeah.

250
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,814
Okay. Again.
In through the nose.

251
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,553
All right.
Just keep doing that.

252
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,354
Keep breathing like that.
That's perfect. Good job.

253
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,133
Keep her relaxed.
Do not let her panic.

254
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:35,133
Wow, man.
That was awesome.

255
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,734
I mean, that was like a...

256
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,936
...Jedi moment.

257
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,383
Jack!

258
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,619
What will happen if she doesn't
get her medicine?

259
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,725
Then we have to make Sawyer
give it to us.

260
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:59,423
Yeah. That's what I'm gonna do.

261
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,228
No, not you. Me.

262
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,735
I served five years
in the Republican Guard.

263
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,668
You were a communications officer.

264
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:10,538
Part of my training entailed
getting the enemy to communicate.

265
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,105
Just give me ten minutes with him.

266
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,876
He'll give us the medicine.

267
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,019
Is that a yes?

268
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,292
Yes.

269
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,325
Food from the plane's
been gone over a week, dude.

270
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,098
What,
no secret stash for emergencies?

271
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,572
You and Jack have
a bunch of stuff in that cave.

272
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:43,801
Sorry, man.

273
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:47,470
No peanut butter,
no peanuts, no nothing.

274
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,036
Yeah, but...

275
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:52,515
There's got to be something.
I mean, look at you.

276
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,588
- Look at what?
- No, no, listen...

277
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,922
- Fat guy hoarding the food, you think?
- No.

278
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,521
We've been here for two weeks,
you know, and you've not really...

279
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,531
- Slimmed down?
- All I need's a bag...

280
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,033
I have no food, all right?

281
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,031
And for the record,
I'm down a notch on my belt.

282
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,267
Oh!

283
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm a big guy. It's gonna be a while
before you give me a piggyback ride.

284
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,342
Sorry.

285
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,244
Sorry.

286
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,374
- That was bad form.
- Yeah.

287
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,419
- I'm used to it.
- So there's not even a bag of...

288
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,318
- Dude.
- Okay.

289
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,981
All right. I'm sorry.

290
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,488
Ahh! Ah!

291
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,556
Damn, stupid...

292
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,869
Michael?

293
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,906
- Oh.
- The sick girl.

294
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:58,244
- Yeah, asthma.
- Yes, asthma.

295
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,309
I think I can help her.

296
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,728
Good morning.

297
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,162
What are you doing?

298
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:27,003
- Jack!
- This was Sawyer's choice, not mine.

299
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,513
If you do this...

300
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,617
Well, ain't you the brave one?
Jumping a guy while he's napping.

301
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,891
Uh-oh.

302
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,367
I'm in trouble now, ain't I?

303
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,365
Sawyer...

304
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,008
We gave you the chance
to do the right thing.

305
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,382
Now, all I want is the asthma medicine.
Just tell me where the inhalers are...

306
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,443
...and we'll stop.

307
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,389
- Stop what, Chico?

308
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,193
It doesn't have to be this way.

309
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,799
Yeah, it does.

310
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,211
We do not have bamboo in Iraq,

311
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:46,985
although we do have
something similar. Reeds.

312
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,424
But their effect is the same

313
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,895
when the chutes are inserted
underneath the fingernails.

314
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,232
You know what I think, Ali?

315
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,738
I think you've never actually
tortured anybody in your life.

316
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,199
Unfortunately for us both...

317
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,869
...you're wrong.

318
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:28,599
That's it?
That's all you got?

319
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,295
Splinters?

320
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,599
No wonder we kicked your ass
in the Gulf...

321
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,107
Sayid.

322
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,640
Sayid!

323
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,384
No. Don't stop now.

324
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,587
I think my sinuses are clearing.

325
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,154
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Perhaps losing an eye...

326
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,534
...will loosen your tongue.

327
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,304
Okay!

328
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,464
Okay.

329
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,708
Where is it?

330
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,246
The only person I'll tell...

331
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,145
...is her.

332
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,053
- Kate?
- That's the deal.

333
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,896
Tell me, Sawyer,
do you want to die?

334
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,135
'Cause when a man
walks into my place

335
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:44,733
and tells me he left 160,000
of my hard-won dollars

336
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,040
in the care of a civilian,

337
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,446
I gotta ask myself if what I'm hearing
isn't a desperate cry

338
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,451
for the sweet release of death.

339
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,178
The deal closed today.

340
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,555
See, women are easy.

341
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,494
A few Cosmos, a couple of stunts
they haven't seen between the sheets

342
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,930
and they think the scam
is their idea.

343
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,227
Now, the husbands...
They need to touch the money.

344
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,736
Smell it.

345
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,771
Believe if they had the brass
to put that case

346
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,536
in the trunk of their family sedan
and speed away,

347
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,977
they just might have a chance
at being an honest-to-gosh outlaw.

348
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,081
Okay, Tex.

349
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,584
You got your grift so pat...

350
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,421
...what did you need my money for?

351
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,482
Where's your seed
from the last couple you roped?

352
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,584
Well, what can I say?

353
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:40,427
I like earning it
as much as I like spending it.

354
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,794
Be that as it may,

355
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,034
I know a thing or two
about making people suffer.

356
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:54,636
Now, you have my money,
plus 50 percent by noon tomorrow,

357
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,713
or I'll tell you all about it.

358
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,804
So I'm here.
Where is it?

359
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,815
Happy to tell you,
soon as I get that kiss.

360
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,413
What? Are you serious?

361
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,355
Baby, I am tied to a tree
in a jungle of mystery,

362
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,018
and I just got tortured
by a damn spinal surgeon

363
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,687
and a genuine Iraqi.

364
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,631
Of course I'm serious.

365
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,194
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Freckles.

366
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,737
You're really gonna let
that girl suffocate

367
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:57,036
because you can't bring yourself
to give me one little kiss?

368
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,777
Hell, it's only first base.

369
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,507
Lucky for you I ain't greedy.

370
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,188
Okay.

371
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,957
Okay.

372
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,796
Mmm.

373
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,411
I don't have it.

374
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,480
What?

375
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,695
The medicine.

376
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,928
I don't have it. Never did.

377
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:32,368
The book. They said
you found it in their luggage.

378
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,270
Book washed up on shore.

379
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,601
Went in the drink
with the rest of the...

380
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,891
- He doesn't have it.
- What?

381
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,861
He's lying. Can't you see that?
He's been lying from the beginning.

382
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,956
He doesn't want us to get off.
That's why he attacked me.

383
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,763
- Hold on a minute.
- He destroyed the transceiver!

384
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,270
You don't know that.
Sayid.

385
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,491
You hit an artery.

386
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,726
Keep still, damn it.

387
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,962
Sayid, I need my stuff from the caves.
My leather backpack.

388
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,301
Go!

389
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,234
Can you make it stop?

390
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,524
Whose blood is that?

391
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,500
Whose blood is that?

392
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,729
Sawyer.

393
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,632
You went after Sawyer
and didn't tell me? She's my sister.

394
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,369
Boone!

395
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,501
Don't leave me alone, okay?

396
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,855
I'm not going anywhere.

397
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,986
Okay?

398
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,522
Okay.

399
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,929
These the right ones?

400
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,531
- I think I found the right tree...
- Let me see.

401
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:53,004
Oh, yes. Good.

402
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,858
Hmm?

403
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,495
Don't, man.

404
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,900
I'm telling you.

405
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,102
Don't.

406
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,353
Let go. I know you want to.

407
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,157
Shut up,
and stop moving.

408
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,528
You've been waiting for this.
You get to be a hero again,

409
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:52,091
because that's what you do.
You fix everything up all nice.

410
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:59,234
Tell him to let go, Freckles.
We already made out.

411
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,278
What else have I got to live for?

412
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:07,214
Hey, Jack, there's something
you should know.

413
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,379
If the tables were turned...

414
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,151
...l'd watch you die.

415
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,018
Alrighty.

416
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,159
Looks like we're in the oil business.

417
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,668
- We're cool?
- Oh, we're cool.

418
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,662
- We get the money back...
- A week from tomorrow. Tripled.

419
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,472
- You're not gonna skip town, are you?
- David, for God's sake.

420
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,513
He left all his money with us.
We could've skipped town.

421
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,947
A smart woman you got there, David.

422
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,144
Don't let her go.

423
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,548
Hi, baby.
What are you doing up?

424
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,524
Are you feeling better?

425
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,857
Will you read to me?

426
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,692
In a minute, sweetheart.
We have company.

427
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,104
Are you okay?

428
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,507
Deal's off.

429
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,378
- Excuse me?
- Deal's off. Forget it.

430
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,506
- What are you doing?
- Is this a joke?

431
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,709
- Walking away.
- You're not walking out.

432
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,310
Know what I had to do for this,
all this in one day?

433
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,252
Take your hand off me, boy.

434
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,051
- Sawyer?
- What's going on here?

435
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,491
This isn't how it was supposed
to work. You said we were...

436
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,358
He said?
What did he say?

437
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,521
You're lucky to be alive.

438
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,562
Jack?

439
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,163
He went to the caves
to check on Shannon.

440
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,266
I read it again.
And then again.

441
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,005
I've been trying to figure out
why you beat up Boone

442
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:18,776
instead of just telling him
you didn't have his sister's medication.

443
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,280
Why you pretended to have it anyway.

444
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:26,153
The thing that I keep coming back
around to is that you want to be hated.

445
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:30,254
And then I looked at the envelope.

446
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,795
"America's Bicentennial.
Knoxville, Tennessee."

447
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,458
You were just a kid.

448
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,469
- Eight, maybe nine years old.
- Kate.

449
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,301
This letter wasn't written to you.

450
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,637
You wrote this letter.

451
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,871
Your name's not Sawyer, is it?

452
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,643
It was his name.

453
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,616
He was a confidence man.

454
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,889
Romanced my momma
to get to the money.

455
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,488
Wiped them out clean,
left a mess behind.

456
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,766
So I wrote that letter.

457
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,267
I wrote it knowing
one day I'd find him.

458
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,472
But that ain't the sad part.

459
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,638
When I was 19,

460
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:30,543
I needed six grand to pay
these guys off I was in trouble with.

461
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,858
So I found a pretty lady with a dumb
husband who had some money.

462
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,659
And I got them to give it to me.

463
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,361
How's that for a tragedy?

464
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,300
I became the man I was hunting.

465
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,972
I became Sawyer.

466
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:07,920
Don't you feel sorry for me.

467
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,795
Get the hell out.

468
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,931
Get out!

469
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,996
It was like some miracle.
She showed up with that mixture.

470
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:55,800
She rubbed it on Shannon's chest
and ten minutes later she was breathing.

471
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,511
Eucalyptus.

472
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,111
Smart, Jack.

473
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,451
Thank you.

474
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,959
Very much.

475
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,280
- What are you doing?
- Packing your stuff.

476
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,820
You're moving to the caves.

477
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,913
You didn't?

478
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,958
Peanut butter?

479
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,024
No way.

480
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,459
Just like you ordered.

481
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,291
Oh. There is one thing.

482
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,535
It's extra smooth.

483
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,993
That's okay.

484
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,377
It... It's empty.

485
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:15,209
What?

486
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,881
No, it's not. It's full.

487
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,023
Full to the brim...

488
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:26,086
...with stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth,

489
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:31,032
oh, God, it makes you want
a glass of milk, extra smooth...

490
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:43,076
It's the best bloody peanut butter
I've ever tasted.

491
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,444
You want some?

492
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,229
Sayid?

493
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,970
I can't stay here.

494
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:15,804
What?

495
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,677
I'm leaving.
I don't know how long.

496
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,739
Sayid, you can't...

497
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,580
We don't know what's out there.

498
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,816
I have worse things to fear
than what's in the jungle.

499
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,323
What I did today,

500
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,691
what I almost did,

501
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:35,061
I swore to do never again.

502
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:39,933
If I can't keep that promise,
I have no right to be here.

503
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,738
There's nowhere to go.

504
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,708
Someone has to walk the shore
and map the island.

505
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,643
See what else there is.

506
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:53,081
I can't think of a better person
to do it than the only one I trust.

507
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,615
I hope we meet again.
