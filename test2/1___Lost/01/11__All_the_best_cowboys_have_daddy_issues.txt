1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,197
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,640
I think...
I think I'm all right.

3
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,176
- I told you I'd take care of you.
- Thanks.

4
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,871
You're quite welcome.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,005
- Listen to me.
- Sayid.

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,208
We're not alone.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,649
I was sleeping, and I woke up,

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,279
and he was trying
to hurt my baby.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,789
- We gotta find out who everyone is.
- A census.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:25,984
- Lance!
- Sorry?

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,526
- Your name's Lance?
- Ethan.

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,061
Dude, that's right.

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,324
I want you to take these.
They're very mild.

14
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,457
You think
I'm making this up?

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,024
It was safe at the beach.
It's not safe here.

16
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,002
- What did you say?
- We got a problem.

17
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,971
The census.
I interviewed everyone.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,736
One isn't in the manifest.
He wasn't on the plane.

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,572
Ethan.

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,408
- Who wasn't on the plane?
- Ethan.

21
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,316
He's not on the passenger manifest.

22
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,878
- Where is he?
- I saw him yesterday...

23
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,187
- Has anyone seen Ethan?
- Yeah, he went to get some wood.

24
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,854
Took off on the path to the beach.
Is he okay? What happened?

25
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,421
- Where's Charlie?
- What?

26
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,023
Where's Charlie?

27
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,035
He went after Claire.

28
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,111
Jack!

29
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,092
She was moving back to the beach.

30
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,431
Claire. That's hers.

31
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,471
What happened?
Where are they?

32
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,301
I don't know.

33
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,467
Footprints.

34
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:53,068
At least three distinct sets
all over the place.

35
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,637
It looks like there
might have been a struggle.

36
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,575
What? What is it?

37
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,212
Drag marks here, and here.

38
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,122
Claire and Charlie.
They were together.

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,521
I think they've been taken.

40
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:17,059
Claire! Charlie!

41
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,469
Jack! Jack!

42
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,968
Shh.

43
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,274
The tracks are still fresh.

44
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,605
This doesn't make any sense.

45
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,275
How could one man drag two people,
one pregnant?

46
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,808
You're asking the wrong question.
Not how, why?

47
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,580
- You think it was Ethan?
- Feels like it was Ethan.

48
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,592
By himself? How?

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,719
We can't account
for all of our people.

50
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,958
And more importantly, who's to say
they're even our people?

51
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,399
- What?
- Sayid said there were others.

52
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,028
- Sayid said we're not alone.
- Semantics.

53
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,005
Sayid's injured.
We don't even know where he went.

54
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:31,066
- This is what the ground is telling me.
- So, which way?

55
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,237
Jack, we don't know
what's going on here.

56
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,406
- We know enough.
- We need to prepare.

57
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,678
We could be back at the caves,
organize a search party...

58
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,117
Which way did they go, Locke?

59
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,570
- Stats are dropping.
- Come on.

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,212
- She's bleeding.
- Got the artery almost there.

61
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,837
- Arrest.

62
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,542
One milligram epi.
Let's get the crash cart!

63
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,108
All right, artery's sealed.
Close her up.

64
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,313
- Charged?
- Charged.

65
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,582
Clear.

66
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,189
- Charged?
- We're charged.

67
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,386
Clear.

68
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,060
Come on.

69
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:30,193
Come on back now.

70
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,937
Come on now.
Come on back.

71
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,268
Come on.

72
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,135
Call it.

73
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,739
Come on, baby.
Come back. Come on, baby.

74
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,614
Come on now.
You can do this.

75
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,648
Come on.

76
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,792
Call it, Jack.

77
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,028
It's over. Call it.

78
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,608
You call it.

79
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,325
You let him go alone?

80
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,885
Don't worry, I'll catch up.

81
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,658
What's the word from the beach?

82
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,666
Nothing.
Nobody has seen him.

83
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,168
- I'm coming with you.
- I figured you might.

84
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,332
What are you doing?

85
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,340
We need to get back to the beach.

86
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,706
You're forming a search party.
Can I help?

87
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,610
It's an island.
There's no choppers.

88
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,807
How exactly are
you gonna find them?

89
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,112
By following Ethan's trail.

90
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,245
No one can walk without leaving signs,
bending grass,

91
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,188
breaking twigs,
especially with captives in tow.

92
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,653
And yes, I could use another hand
if you're up for it.

93
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,890
- I'm up for it.
- Then let's get moving.

94
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,832
I could take Vincent. He can sniff
something that belonged to Charlie,

95
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,965
- And I can help.
- I said no, man.

96
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,033
Hey, Locke.

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,545
A lot of us don't wanna sit here
waiting for news.

98
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,978
Thanks, but we're set.

99
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,609
- Anyone else is gonna slow us down.
- Okay.

100
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,846
Maybe I'll just put together
another party.

101
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,249
Good idea.

102
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,187
We're going north. You go south.

103
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,206
Come on.

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,211
Never thought
I'd see the day, Jack.

105
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,192
You barge into my OR,
you work on my patient.

106
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,326
- You didn't have to do this.
- I don't have to do anything.

107
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah, of course you don't.

108
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,393
I chose to do this procedure.

109
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,771
This emergency procedure because
when this girl crashed in the ER,

110
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,833
- They called me.
- I was right upstairs.

111
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,140
You should've stayed.
How did you find out?

112
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,477
One of the nurses came to get me.

113
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,008
Who?

114
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,480
Oh, thank God I have you

115
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,648
and some anonymous nurse
to rescue me.

116
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,749
She told me
your hands were shaking.

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,351
- My hands were not...
- You cut her artery.

118
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:19,296
She was in a car crash, Jack.
Her insides were a mess.

119
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,265
- They called me.
- You made a mistake.

120
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,235
I don't care whether they called you,
you made a mistake.

121
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,103
Are you lecturing me?
You tell me, if you were upstairs,

122
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,372
and I was in a restaurant having lunch,
then why did they call me?

123
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,317
How many drinks did you have
at lunch, Dad?

124
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,658
Jack!

125
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,700
Jack?

126
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,167
Good thing you were
going in a circle.

127
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:04,403
Not much of a search grid, but we
never would have found you otherwise.

128
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,104
Did you find anything?

129
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,140
No.

130
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,083
You should go back
to the caves... Sayid's leg.

131
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,620
I dressed Sayid's leg.
You found me.

132
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,418
We can find Charlie and Claire.
Do we have a trail?

133
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,051
- Jack, this was my fault.
- What?

134
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,893
I hunted with Ethan, I spent time
with him. I never sensed anything...

135
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,263
...off. For everything I know
about hunting and tracking,

136
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,199
whoever he is, he knows more.

137
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,760
If we catch him,
I don't want anything to happen

138
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,296
to the only physician on the island.
So go back, be the doctor.

139
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,468
Let me be the hunter.

140
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,572
Can we go now?

141
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,280
Follow me.

142
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,524
I'm trying to help,
and the guy tells me "Go south"?

143
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,192
Like what? I'm gonna get
in his way or something?

144
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,395
We're all tweaked.
Locke's feeling it like the rest of us.

145
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,734
I got five guys
who are going with me.

146
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,773
Putting our necks on the line
to find Charlie and Claire.

147
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,868
I'm saying,
I'm sick of being treated

148
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,277
like a second-class citizen
around here

149
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,816
because Mount Baldy
can bag a boar.

150
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,249
He knows a lot more
than how to catch a boar.

151
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,253
Mr. Locke's a warrior.
He can hunt,

152
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,381
he can track stuff, and he's
the only one who brought knives.

153
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,757
So if it were me,
I'd listen to him.

154
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,497
Well, I don't want you to.

155
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,591
You understand?

156
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,401
You stay with Hurley.

157
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,000
I might not be a warrior,

158
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,306
but I am going south.

159
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,145
Back home,

160
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,883
I'm known as something
of a warrior myself.

161
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:14,471
We mark our progress
by line of sight.

162
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,065
Tie these off
so we don't get lost.

163
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,441
You can lead us
back to camp, right?

164
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,139
If nothing happens to me.

165
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,582
Maybe I'd better take
marker detail.

166
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,826
- Anything?
- Not yet.

167
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,663
- If you can't find the trail...
- I'll pick it up again.

168
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,724
We need to rest,
get our clarity back.

169
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,238
You're gonna take a break?
It's gotta be almost 4:00.

170
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,170
- When the sun sets...
- It's 4:25.

171
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,538
And, yes, I'm taking a break.

172
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,342
Can I talk to you for a sec?

173
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:06,553
Would it kill you to give
the guy a little space?

174
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,183
It might.

175
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,727
- Stop that.
- What?

176
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,863
That.

177
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,206
What's going on?

178
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,173
I didn't believe her.

179
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,340
- Claire. I gave her a sedative.
- Jack...

180
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,874
She told me someone was after her,
she was being attacked, and I...

181
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,316
She just seemed so out of it.

182
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,721
I thought that her pregnancy
was amping up her stress, and I...

183
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,495
I didn't believe her.

184
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,425
Jack!

185
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,738
What is it?

186
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,821
- Look familiar?
- It's Charlie's.

187
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,449
You think it just came off?

188
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,322
No.

189
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,452
He's leaving us a trail.

190
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,843
They went this way.

191
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,109
I'm not so sure.

192
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,117
There's another trail here.

193
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,522
- What do you mean?
- These are footprints.

194
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,319
People moved off this way.

195
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,923
Charlie's leaving these for us.
They went that way.

196
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,492
Unless Charlie
isn't the one leaving them.

197
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,029
If Ethan knows we're behind him,
he could be setting up a dummy trail.

198
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,736
Take off in one direction,
double back in his own footprints.

199
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,971
- Wait, now you're a tracker?
- You're just full of surprises.

200
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,521
So we've got two trails.
Let's split up. I'll take that one.

201
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,887
We should stay together.

202
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,587
Why? We've got two trails,
and apparently two trackers.

203
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,926
Be careful.

204
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,542
- Who got taken by what?
- Charlie and Claire.

205
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,676
- They think Ethan took 'em.
- Ethan took 'em?

206
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,379
Yeah.

207
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,685
Took 'em why?
And who the hell's Ethan?

208
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:55,056
I don't know. He wasn't on
the list thing, the manifest.

209
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,652
Ever think he might have
lied about his name?

210
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,925
It's stupid to lie about your name.

211
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,434
All righty, Tattoo.
Where do you think Ethan came from?

212
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:10,236
Maybe he was already
on the island before we were.

213
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,878
Got yourself one hell
of an imagination, kid.

214
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,040
There could be
lots of other people.

215
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,051
So a tribe of evil natives
planted a ringer in the camp

216
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,852
to kidnap a pregnant girl
and a reject from VH-1 has-beens.

217
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,949
Yeah, fiendishly clever.

218
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,755
And why am I getting the news
from a 6-year-old?

219
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,288
- I'm 10.
- Okay, then it must be true.

220
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:39,394
If you don't believe me, ask Sayid.
He said we're not alone.

221
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,473
Sayid's back?

222
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,382
Red shirt.

223
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,423
Huh?

224
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,787
Red shirt.

225
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,056
<i>You ever watch Star Trek? </i>

226
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,187
Oh, not really.

227
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:09,598
The crew guys that would go down
to the planet with the main guys,

228
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,535
the captain and the guy
with the pointy ears.

229
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,339
They always wore red shirts,
and they always got killed.

230
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,102
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

231
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,148
Sounds like a piss-poor captain.

232
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,549
What do you do
in the real world, Mr. Locke?

233
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:34,091
- It's John.
- John.

234
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,725
Why don't you guess?

235
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,662
You're either
a taxidermist or a hit man.

236
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,894
I was a...

237
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,169
...regional collections supervisor
for a box company.

238
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,474
A box company?

239
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,747
They made boxes.

240
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,289
Yeah, right.

241
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,349
- Please slow down!
- You said they went this way.

242
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:12,090
I think they went this way.
I'm not as good at this as Locke is.

243
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,202
So where'd you pick up
the tracking skills, Kate?

244
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,034
Was that before
or after you were on the run?

245
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,037
- I'm trying to help.
- You know what might help?

246
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:30,707
A little honesty. Just give me
something real. Anything.

247
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,486
My dad was in the army.
Ranger Battalion.

248
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,457
He was stationed
at Fort Lewis, Washington State.

249
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,590
We'd go hiking together.

250
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,296
One day we spent
eight hours tracking deer.

251
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,503
Being in the woods,
it was like...

252
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,873
It was like his religion.

253
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,954
That was real.

254
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,859
Anything you wanna share?

255
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,496
Well, thanks for coming in, Jack.
Have a seat.

256
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,782
- What's it say?
- The truth.

257
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,651
A patient was brought to the ER
following a car accident,

258
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,190
rushed into surgery
with internal bleeding.

259
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:49,557
You joined me, and in spite
of our most heroic efforts,

260
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,324
the patient succumbed
to her injuries.

261
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,226
Looks like you fixed everything
but the patient.

262
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,166
You had no business being in OR.

263
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,334
You think I would have
walked in there

264
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,969
- If I couldn't handle it?
- You've done it before.

265
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,946
That's right, because I am
capable of making those...

266
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,347
How can you say that
after what happened?

267
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,908
- The problem is not...
- You were impaired.

268
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,080
I know my limits.

269
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:20,683
- I won't sign this.
- You were part of a team, Jack.

270
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,488
I'm not the only one on the hook.

271
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,722
You called me off.

272
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,230
You were the surgeon of record
when she died.

273
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:35,203
Look, accidents happen
in surgeries all the time.

274
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,469
That's the truth,
and you know it.

275
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,408
But if you contradict this report,

276
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,708
if you mention alcohol,

277
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,806
well, that's the only fact
that's gonna matter.

278
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,874
They'll strip me of my license.

279
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,449
Yes.

280
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,387
They will.

281
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:05,933
I know...
I have been hard on you.

282
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:12,107
But that is how you make
a soft metal into steel.

283
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,771
That is why you are

284
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,440
the most gifted
young surgeon in this city.

285
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,716
I mean, this... this is a career

286
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,558
that is all about
the greater good.

287
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,656
I've had to sacrifice

288
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,465
certain aspects
of my relationship with you

289
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:45,405
so that hundreds and thousands
of patients will live

290
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,710
because of your
extraordinary skills.

291
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,959
I know it's a long...

292
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,297
...long time coming.

293
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:19,103
What happened yesterday,

294
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,271
I promise you,

295
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,975
will never happen again.

296
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,849
After all that I've given...

297
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,395
This isn't... This is not
just about my career, Jack.

298
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,463
It's my life.

299
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:16,267
Thank you, son. Thank you.

300
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,050
Well, well, well.

301
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,452
I don't know if you Islams
got a concept of karma,

302
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,624
but I get the sense this island
just served you up a platter

303
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,600
of cosmic payback.

304
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,295
- What do you want?
- Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me

305
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:58,173
with his antibiotics, so I gotta hump it
up here every day to get my meds.

306
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,007
You know,
a less magnanimous man than I

307
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,017
might be thinking he could beat
the living snot out of you

308
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,885
- Without fear of reprisal.
- You want a shot, take it.

309
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,052
Know that I left this camp out
of shame for what I did to you.

310
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,993
It was never my intention to return.

311
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,691
Sorry, fresh out
of sweet forgiveness.

312
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,529
If it wasn't your intention to return,
then why did you?

313
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,368
I was taken prisoner
by the French woman.

314
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,504
One who's sending out
a distress signal for 16 years?

315
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,573
- She's alive?
- She was on a science expedition.

316
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:42,677
- She said they shipwrecked.
- She alone?

317
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,780
She said that there are others
on this island.

318
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,449
- Her people?
- No.

319
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,926
She believed
they had all gotten sick.

320
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,294
She murdered her entire team.

321
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,903
Right.

322
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,569
- These others, who are they?
- I don't know.

323
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,167
- She's never seen them.
- She's never seen them,

324
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,213
- But she knows they're there?
- If you believe her.

325
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,908
Do you?

326
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,081
Maybe.

327
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,484
Maybe not.

328
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,814
But on my way back,

329
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,761
I heard something in the jungle,

330
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,959
- Surrounding me.
- Something like what?

331
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,567
Have you got something
to say to me, Sawyer?

332
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,608
Or are you going
to ask me questions

333
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,008
you know I don't have
the answers to?

334
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,347
Tide's coming up the beach.

335
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,218
The plane hull's
almost in the water.

336
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,059
I kept your signal fire burning.

337
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,431
- Crap.
- Your blots can't get in.

338
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,971
I know my blots can't get in.

339
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,699
- My roll.
- Yahoo.

340
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,003
I need a four-three.

341
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,674
Dude, would you please roll?

342
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,386
- Yes!
- No!

343
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,185
Your turn.

344
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,387
It's okay. I wasn't good
when I started playing, either.

345
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,262
I didn't just start playing.

346
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,994
I took 17th in a tournament once.

347
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,467
17th is not very good.

348
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,028
No, 17th is very good.

349
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,004
Come on, double sixes,
double sixes.

350
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,309
- Yes!
- You gotta be kidding me.

351
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,042
- I'm lucky.
- No one is that lucky.

352
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,346
My dad said I was
the luckiest person he knew.

353
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:54,976
Really?

354
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,920
Not Michael.
Brian, my other dad.

355
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,653
Yeah. Um...

356
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,729
Yes! Yes!

357
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,824
One more game.
Double or nothing.

358
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,664
I can't. I got a meeting.

359
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,398
- A meeting?
- Yeah, a meeting.

360
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,736
You owe me $20,000.

361
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,639
You'll get it.

362
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:27,509
It's been about 15 minutes
since we've seen any sign.

363
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,978
- What are we following?
- My gut.

364
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,285
Great.

365
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,621
So, Boone, what do you do
in the real world?

366
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,689
I run a business.

367
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,427
What kind of business?

368
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,628
It's a wedding thing.

369
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,199
Huh?

370
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,208
My mother has this empire.

371
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,039
The Martha Stewart of matrimony.

372
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,806
I run one of the subsidiaries.

373
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:57,143
So, who's running it now?

374
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,174
I guess it doesn't matter, does it?

375
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,781
I'm sure there are people
who can handle it temporarily.

376
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,757
It's gonna start raining
in one minute.

377
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,317
- One minute?
- Give or take a few seconds.

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,462
- You should head back.
- What?

379
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,092
Trail's been cold,
dangerous terrain ahead.

380
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,931
You'll make it back before dark.

381
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,938
- And you?
- I take care of myself.

382
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,667
- No.
- I admire your courage...

383
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,868
I'm not heading back.

384
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,447
All right.

385
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,660
They teach you how to predict
the weather at a box company?

386
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,343
I guess we were right.

387
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,650
Where to now?

388
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,495
Jack!

389
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,763
Jack, where are you going?

390
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,407
- Didn't you hear her?
- Hear who?

391
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,057
Jack!

392
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,354
If you do not stop following me,

393
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,892
I will kill one of them.

394
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,485
- Do you understand?

395
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,548
No more warnings.

396
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,855
<i>Blue team
to ICU, please. </i>

397
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,725
- Dr. Shephard.
- Andrea.

398
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,293
Andrea.

399
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,967
That man that
my father's talking to.

400
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,272
- Who is that?
- That's her husband.

401
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,112
He's threatening to sue.

402
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,680
Sir, I'm very sorry.

403
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,634
Jack!

404
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,306
- Are you okay?
- How long was I out?

405
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,710
I don't know, few minutes.
You slipped with all the rocks.

406
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,578
- Ethan.
- What?

407
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,947
- Ethan was here.
- You banged your head.

408
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,146
- No, no. He was here.
- You have to stop.

409
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:02,023
The rain has washed away the trail.
Even if he was here, you've got...

410
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:05,153
- I'm not letting him do this.
- Not letting him?

411
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,427
Not again.

412
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,964
She had massive
internal hemorrhaging.

413
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:16,337
We realized that her blood pressure
was continuing to drop precipitously.

414
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,433
At which point, the patient
went into cardiac arrest.

415
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,745
Of course, every effort
was made to resuscitate her,

416
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,783
but the severity of her injuries,

417
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,341
the amount of internal bleeding

418
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,046
made that impossible.

419
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,920
In my professional opinion,
ladies and gentlemen,

420
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,483
and that's all I have...

421
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,756
...by the time I was called in,

422
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,924
the damage was irreversible.

423
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,498
Okay. Thanks, Christian.

424
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,403
- Sorry about this formality.
- Of course.

425
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,909
Just one final detail. You were aware
of the patient's pregnancy

426
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,968
- When you went into the procedure?
- Absolutely.

427
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:59,176
The patient's husband had informed
the attending in the ER.

428
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,946
It was, however, extremely early
in the pregnancy

429
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,751
so our primary focus
had to be on the mother.

430
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,687
Okay, I think we're done here.
Our final report will be filed.

431
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,163
Okay.

432
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,426
I need to... 

433
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:23,034
...revise my statement.

434
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:31,644
I didn't come in
until well into the procedure.

435
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,978
Jack.

436
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,212
I was warned
by one of the nurses

437
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,618
that my father was operating...

438
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:42,326
...under the influence.
- Jack, this is not...

439
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,055
By the time I got there,
it was clear my father

440
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,656
was not only incapacitated,
but that he had also...

441
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,100
...severed the patient's
hepatic artery,

442
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,968
which,
in my professional opinion,

443
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,270
caused the crisis
which led to her death.

444
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:31,636
No!

445
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,875
We gotta cut him down.

446
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,322
Hold on, Charlie.
Hold on there.

447
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,539
I can't reach!

448
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,134
Pull him over!

449
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,141
Harder!

450
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,597
He's not breathing.

451
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,851
Come on, breathe.

452
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,412
Breathe, Charlie, come on.

453
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,253
Breathe!

454
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,093
Come on.

455
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,635
Come on.

456
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,761
Come on!

457
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,449
Come on.

458
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,943
Jack.

459
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,112
No, Jack.

460
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,192
Come on, Charlie!

461
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,458
Come on.

462
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,930
Come on, Charlie.

463
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,059
Come on!

464
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,627
Come on, Charlie. Come on!

465
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,811
Come on!

466
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,283
Jack. Jack, he's... Jack, stop.

467
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,845
He's not coming...

468
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,850
It's okay.

469
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,347
- No.
- Jack.

470
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:37,223
- Jack!
- Come on.

471
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,025
- Stop!
- Come on.

472
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,274
Yeah. Just breathe.

473
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:04,014
Breathe. That's it.

474
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,581
Just breathe. Just breathe deep.
Breathe deep.

475
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,404
There you are.
You're okay.

476
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:38,886
Dad!

477
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,129
They brought Charlie back, but he
hasn't said anything since he came back.

478
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,933
They find Claire?

479
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,749
Does that hurt?

480
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,622
How's your breathing?

481
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,728
Charlie.

482
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,026
You gotta talk to me.

483
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,770
We're gonna go look for Claire
the moment the sun comes up.

484
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,467
And I could really
use your help.

485
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:35,239
I mean, anything that
you can tell me about...

486
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,544
...what you remember,
where you were going.

487
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:42,052
Did you see or hear...

488
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,280
I didn't see anything.

489
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,687
Hear anything.

490
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,596
I don't remember...

491
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,396
...anything.

492
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:05,605
Claire.

493
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,071
What?

494
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,081
That's all they wanted.

495
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,881
"They."

496
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,012
All they wanted was Claire.

497
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,161
They aren't back yet.

498
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,872
I'm sure they just made camp
for the night.

499
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,608
If there's anyone on this island
your brother's safe with, it's Locke.

500
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,784
Are we lost?

501
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,348
No, Boone, we're not lost.

502
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,189
Sorry, it's just...

503
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:01,322
I don't see how you can still
be following his trail.

504
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,493
I think we should go back, man.

505
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,732
- Don't you feel it?
- Feel what?

506
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,536
It.

507
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,942
All right, John...

508
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,416
- I'm gonna follow the strips back.
- Suit yourself.

509
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,413
Boone.

510
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,925
You need this more than I do.

511
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,066
What is that?

512
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,141
Steel.

513
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,049
Could that be part of the plane?

514
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,348
Part of the wreckage?

515
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,100
What is that?

516
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,667
That's what
we're gonna find out.
