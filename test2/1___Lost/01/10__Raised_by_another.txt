00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,594
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,332
- Mayday! Mayday!

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,842
French! The French are coming! I've
never been so happy to hear the French!

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,377
- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,612
I'm alone now.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,447
On the island alone.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,511
Please, someone come.

8
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,956
The others, they're...
They're dead.

9
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,425
It killed them.

10
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,321
It killed them all."

11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,335
- I can't stay here.
- There's nowhere to go.

12
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,668
Someone has to walk the shore
and map the island.

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,969
See what else there is.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,600
I hope we meet again.

15
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,517
- What's happening?
- You know what's happening.

16
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,954
- But I don't understand. Why...?
- It was your responsibility,

17
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,520
but you gave him away, Claire.

18
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:51,294
- Everyone pays the price now.

19
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,715
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
It's Charlie! It's Charlie!

20
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,690
Wait, wait, wait a minute!

21
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,528
It's okay! It's okay.

22
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,531
- It's all right. You were dreaming.

23
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,204
You were sleepwalking.
All right?

24
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,275
Okay.

25
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,478
Claire, what happened?

26
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,902
Must have been
a hell of a nightmare.

27
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,140
Who said it was a nightmare?

28
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,709
When someone makes a fist so tight

29
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,579
they dig their nails a quarter
of an inch into their palms,

30
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,313
they probably weren't
dreaming about riding ponies.

31
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:52,624
- Did you ever sleepwalk before?
- No. I don't think so.

32
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,025
- How would I know?
- It'd get back to you.

33
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:59,428
I had a girlfriend once that, uh,
told me I talked in my sleep.

34
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,491
- What did you say?
- Don't know.

35
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,537
Whatever it was, she didn't like it.

36
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,811
<i>- How was your OBIG YN in Sydney?
- Good. She was good.</i>

37
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,848
She was okay with letting you fly
in your third trimester?

38
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,616
Yeah, I went for a checkup a week
before, and she said it would be fine.

39
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,514
- Ultrasound was cool?
- Mm-hmm. Very healthy.

40
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,424
- How you been feeling?
- Okay. Back's pretty sore,

41
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,365
but probably just from
sleeping on the ground.

42
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,871
I get dizzy if I stand up too fast.

43
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,930
- And I have to pee all the time.

44
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:46,271
- You eating enough?
- Boar and bananas.

45
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,779
How many weeks in are you?

46
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,510
What was the date that you found out
that you were pregnant?

47
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,680
- Is it pink?
- I don't know.

48
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,382
I mean, did you actually pee on it?

49
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,017
- Just give me a second.
- Maybe you didn't do it right.

50
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,357
- Thomas, I can pee on a stick.
- What color is it?

51
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,690
How long's it been?

52
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:07,699
- Six... 66 seconds. Oh, gosh.
- Shh.

53
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,531
- Okay, there's definitely two lines.
- Two pink lines?

54
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,072
Pink? No, no, no.
These are, like, red.

55
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,903
What?

56
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,067
They're pink.

57
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,874
These two lines... First of all,
these tests are not always accurate.

58
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,212
No, no, no. My uncle, you know,
we thought he had testicular cancer.

59
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,911
- You remember that?
- He did. He's dead.

60
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,716
Well, yeah... I mean, no, no.
It was like a wrong...

61
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,520
It was a bad diagnosis. This thing
doesn't mean for sure you're pregnant.

62
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,890
- Thomas!
- Get another.

63
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,591
I am six weeks late, okay?
Six weeks. That never happens.

64
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,759
I'm pregnant.

65
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:49,504
Okay. Okay, look,
it's all gonna be okay.

66
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,770
I know. I know.

67
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,144
Hey, Claire...

68
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,179
You know, if we wanted to,
we could do this.

69
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,556
- Stop it.
- No, I'm not kidding.

70
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,083
- My mom would disown me.
- She basically has already.

71
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,457
Yeah, and but with what? I mean,
my $5-an-hour job at Fish 'n Fry?

72
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:20,700
You're not the only one with a job, you
know? I mean, I've got my painting.

73
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,101
That's sweet, but...

74
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,944
- This isn't what we want.
- Maybe it is.

75
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,646
You know?

76
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,914
This could be like, uh...

77
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,590
I don't know.
It could be, like, the best thing ever.

78
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,399
You'd really want to try?

79
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,198
Yeah.

80
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:02,208
Claire, I love you.

81
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,933
Well, this is a first.

82
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:28,135
You standing still,
middle of the day, doing nothing.

83
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,574
- Amazing.
- I'm doing something.

84
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,374
Yeah? What's that?

85
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,778
I'm sinking.

86
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,583
Water goes out,
takes the sand with it and you sink.

87
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,990
I used to do it with my mom
when I was a kid.

88
00:08:55,234 --> 00:09:00,035
Ah. New plan. You're gonna just sink
your way right off the island.

89
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,835
Sayid would be proud.

90
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,342
He's been gone for almost a week.

91
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,574
Something tells me he'll be okay.

92
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,351
So, what are you doing
this far from the caves?

93
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,187
Bringing water down.
Bringing fish back.

94
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,559
Claire's gonna have the baby soon.

95
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,440
Dear diary,

96
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,347
still on the bloody island.

97
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,045
Today, I swallowed a bug.

98
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,218
Love, Claire.

99
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:55,694
Here.

100
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,656
What separates us from these
savage Yanks if we can't drink tea?

101
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,266
- Feeling better?
- It was just a dream.

102
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,704
Mmm.

103
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,634
I have this dream.

104
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,736
I'm driving a bus,

105
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,146
and my teeth start falling out.

106
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,277
My mum is in the back,
eating biscuits.

107
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,482
Everything smells of bacon.

108
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,821
It's weird.

109
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,452
Of course, I don't
wake up screaming.

110
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,587
I'm all right, Charlie.

111
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,030
Mmm. No, of course you are.

112
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,469
It's just...

113
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,962
...I think about you...

114
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,101
...in this place.

115
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,838
How hard it must be for you,

116
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,847
without your family
and your friends.

117
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,407
And I think, we could be friends.

118
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,977
I could be your friend.

119
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,557
We don't have to do
each other's hair or anything.

120
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,629
I just mean that, you know,

121
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:08,930
if you needed someone
to talk to about anything,

122
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,237
I'm here.

123
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,533
Charlie...

124
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,851
Okay.

125
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:33,515
- I didn't mean that I...
- It's cool, Claire. It's cool.

126
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,728
Thomas cleaned out his whole loft.

127
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,999
- I'm officially moving in on Tuesday.
- That is great!

128
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,632
I know. He's awesome.

129
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,807
- You know, maybe we shouldn't...
- No.

130
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,244
- You're not backing out now.
- It seems silly.

131
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,906
He's just a psychic, Claire.

132
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,678
I thought you were into this,
all your astrology stuff.

133
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,085
Yeah, I know, but I don't
need somebody telling me

134
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,453
what's gonna happen
or how to live my life.

135
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,015
It's not about what you need.
It's about what's fun.

136
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,257
So unless you have another excuse...

137
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,696
I'll need your hands for this.

138
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,621
So when did you find out?

139
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,401
- What?
- About the baby.

140
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,278
Um... Two days ago.

141
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,616
- She hasn't told her mum yet...
- Shh.

142
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,961
What, should I not tell her?

143
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,098
What? What is it?

144
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,605
I'm sorry. Um...

145
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,905
I can't... I can't...

146
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,970
What were you gonna...?
What did you see?

147
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,415
- I'm not doing this reading.
- No, you were gonna say something.

148
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,386
You'll have to leave. Now.

149
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,981
Thanks, thanks very much.

150
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,064
What a freak.

151
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,783
Help me!

152
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,815
Somebody's trying to hurt me!
Please! Help me!

153
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,857
- Someone attacked her!
- What?

154
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,262
- He held me down!
- Which way did he go?

155
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,198
- I couldn't see...
- What's going on?

156
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,395
Just now! He just ran away!

157
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,335
Fan out, check the surrounding caves.

158
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,805
- Wait, wait, hold on.
- Hurley, come on, let's go.

159
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,072
Come on. Come on.
Let's sit down here, okay?

160
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,274
- Can you get her some water?
- Sure.

161
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,839
Claire, look at me.
It's okay. You're safe now.

162
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,886
- Did you get a look at him at all?
- It was dark. I couldn't see.

163
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,547
- Where did this happen?
- He was here!

164
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,524
I mean, I was sleeping,
and I woke up,

165
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,356
and he was trying to hurt my baby!

166
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,023
He had this thing, like a needle,

167
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,829
and he stabbed me with it!

168
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,631
He was trying to hurt my baby.

169
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,201
It's okay. It's okay.

170
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,210
We hoofed around
the entire perimeter, man.

171
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:23,722
- Nobody saw or heard anything?
- Uh-uh. Nada. Everyone was asleep.

172
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,280
So, I had an idea.

173
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,885
I'm out here looking for some psycho
with Scott and Steve, right?

174
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:33,056
And I'm realizing,
who the hell are Scott and Steve?

175
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,600
- I'm not following you.
- Look, if I was a cop,

176
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,364
and some woman got attacked,
we'd canvas, right?

177
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,565
Knock on doors, find witnesses.
But we don't even have doors.

178
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,631
You're not helping me understand...

179
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,768
We don't know who's living here,

180
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,505
and who's still at the beach.

181
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,479
I mean, we don't
even know each other.

182
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,073
My name isn't Hurley.
It's Hugo Reyes.

183
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,380
Hurley's just a nickname
I have, all right?

184
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,251
Why? I'm not telling.

185
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,883
The point is, we got
to find out who everyone is.

186
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,927
- You want to start a census?
- A registry.

187
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,485
Names, what people look like,
who's related to who.

188
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,657
We lay down the law,
people will stop attacking each other.

189
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,793
Seems like someone's punched
or stabbed every other day.

190
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,702
We got to find out
who did this to her.

191
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,548
You all right?

192
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,993
Don't worry.

193
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,963
If you want to close your eyes,
I'll be here all night.

194
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,831
I won't let anyone get to you.

195
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,098
I won't leave you, Claire.

196
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,368
Promise.

197
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,218
- Wow, we have drapes now.
- I know.

198
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,483
I feel all grown up.

199
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,890
- You like 'em?
- Yeah. They're good.

200
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,258
I don't know why drapes
represent age for me.

201
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,062
I guess it just feels like
something my mum would do.

202
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,326
Oh, um, Sasha called.

203
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,862
They're going out tonight.
They wanted to know if we'd go.

204
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:27,803
What?

205
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,213
I didn't eat all the chips.
There's another bag.

206
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:38,716
Claire? I can't do this.

207
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:44,121
Do what?
Did you have a bad day?

208
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,898
This isn't working.

209
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,305
- Come on, you knew that.
- I what?

210
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,410
Just so I'm not overreacting here,

211
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,512
are you breaking up with me?

212
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,423
For the past three months, it's just,
there's some plan, some responsibility,

213
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,155
somewhere we have to be,
someone you have to talk to.

214
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,459
I'm trying to make sure
when the baby comes...

215
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:23,228
"When the baby..." Yeah.
I mean, that is just not...

216
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,793
If it's like this now, you know,

217
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,601
what's it gonna be like
when the baby comes?

218
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,871
- But you said we should do this.
- Yeah.

219
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,072
Yeah, well, now it's real.

220
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,944
You can't just change your mind.

221
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,041
How in the hell am I
supposed to be a dad, Claire?

222
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,916
How about my painting? My life?

223
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,319
I knew... I knew
this was gonna happen.

224
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,916
I told you so. Perfect. Now I get
all your daddy abandonment crap.

225
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,588
Hey, you bastard, don't you dare try
and justify what you're doing!

226
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,131
I have done nothing!
I've done absolutely nothing.

227
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,427
What, I have?

228
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,594
You don't think
I've seen what you've done?

229
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,002
- Excuse me?
- You were supposed to be on the Pill.

230
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,008
- You think I got pregnant on purpose?
- I don't even care.

231
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,875
Or that this was some kind of plan?
You are out of your mind!

232
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,278
- It's over, Claire!
- No, it's not over!

233
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,249
- I'm out of here.
- Thomas!

234
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,256
John, right? John Locke?

235
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,066
Is this about your census?

236
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,300
Yeah, you know, I thought
it would be a good idea, you know,

237
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,775
get everyone's name
and place of residence.

238
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,971
And who's checking on you?

239
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:44,614
Uh, me.

240
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,742
It was a joke.

241
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,985
- Uh, good one.
- Yep.

242
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,685
You already know my name.

243
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,389
I lived most of my life
in Tustin, California.

244
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,830
Cool. And reason for travel?

245
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:05,462
The reason you were in Australia?

246
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,995
- I was looking for something.
- Looking. Uh-huh.

247
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,974
Right on.

248
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,443
Something.

249
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,776
So, did you find it?

250
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,951
No, it found me.

251
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,324
- Anything else?
- No, no, that's good.

252
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,983
Uh, thanks.

253
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,358
Hey, uh, I know
I already talked to you,

254
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,795
but I just wanted to get
away from him for a second.

255
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,594
Did you see anyone
leave the beach last night?

256
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,794
People come and go, but...

257
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,269
No, I don't know.

258
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,631
What?

259
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,199
- I'm not sure anything happened.
- Wait, what?

260
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,639
Claire told Michael
and I that this attacker

261
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,172
tried to inject her with something.
But there was no mark on her stomach.

262
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,448
She wakes up two nights screaming.
First time, sleepwalking.

263
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,852
Think she's making this up?
She was terrified.

264
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,756
She said he was hurting her baby.
Why would someone do that

265
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,986
- With us 20 feet away?
- You think she's lying?

266
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,394
No. Pregnant woman
have extremely lucid...

267
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,432
- Lucid.
- Textbook anxiety nightmares.

268
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,059
You know everything that's
going on with everyone?

269
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,931
So, what do we do?

270
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,374
Claire's due in a little more
than a week. Maybe two.

271
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,502
But if she stays
stressed out like this

272
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,639
or has another panic attack,
it could trigger an early labor.

273
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:28,311
Out here with no instruments,
no monitors, no anesthetic...

274
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,556
That would not be good.

275
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,092
It's not all in her head.

276
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,500
- Hey, Lance.
- Sorry?

277
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,060
Lance. Your name's Lance, right?

278
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,573
- Ethan.
- Dude, that's right.

279
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,905
Lance is a skinny guy
with glasses and red hair.

280
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,537
I can see how you'd confuse us.

281
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,605
Sorry, dude.
Lots of names and faces.

282
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,345
Pathetic. You'd think
after a couple weeks on the island

283
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,511
with the same people,
we'd know each other.

284
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,955
- You're right. You would think so.
- So we're doing this list,

285
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,925
all the survivors' names,
home addresses, stuff like that.

286
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,825
Okay, well,
you already have my name.

287
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,490
- All right, not Lance.
- Definitely not.

288
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,965
- Last name?
- Rom.

289
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,434
- Rom, R-O-M?
- That's right.

290
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,835
- Great. Where you from, Ethan Rom?
- Ontario.

291
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,307
Right on. Love Canada. Great, uh...

292
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,370
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time, dude.

293
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,712
- Hey, what's this for?
- Oh, it's nothing.

294
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,547
Just, you know,
thought it'd be a good idea.

295
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,949
Claire?

296
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,393
Did you find him?

297
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,364
- Um, no.
- What if he comes back?

298
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,535
Claire...

299
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,034
This situation that we're in,

300
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,373
the crash, that no one's coming,
this place,

301
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,776
it can kind of mess
with your head a little

302
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,338
and make you see things
that aren't actually there.

303
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,078
Now, I know it feels very real...

304
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:11,521
- I don't under...
- Look, your baby's coming.

305
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,888
Soon.

306
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,757
And I can't even imagine
how scary that must be for you.

307
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:22,528
But the more upset you are, the more
dangerous it is for you, and your baby.

308
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,929
So I want you to take these.

309
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,838
- What are they?
- It's a sedative.

310
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,867
Very mild, commonly used
in situations like yours.

311
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:38,075
It won't harm the baby. I promise.

312
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,947
You don't believe me.

313
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,577
- Claire...
- You think I'm making this up?

314
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,285
I get attacked, and you want
to give me sleeping pills?

315
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,420
They're not sleeping...
Look, it's a very mild sedative.

316
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,760
- I'm leaving.
- What? No! Claire. Claire...

317
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:56,733
It was safe at the beach.
It's not safe here.

318
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:01,705
- Don't do this. Think about the baby.
- Don't talk to me about the baby.

319
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,970
I'm sick of everyone telling me
what to do. Let go of me.

320
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,738
You okay?

321
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,011
What did you say to her?

322
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:33,604
- Yes?
- Mr. Malkin, we met before?

323
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:37,904
- Yes, I remember.
- You wouldn't give me a reading.

324
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,137
I was hoping you would now.

325
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:52,152
If you're a psychic,
why do you have to count it?

326
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,524
- That's not how it works.
- I was just joking.

327
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:11,667
So... how does it work?

328
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,368
I don't know.

329
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,316
When did he leave you?

330
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,849
Last week.

331
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,786
Is that why you
didn't want to do my reading?

332
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,823
No, no, no. I saw something,
sort of a blurry thing.

333
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,996
And blurry's bad?

334
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,232
Blurry's bad.

335
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,741
That's why I stopped the reading.

336
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,505
Are you sure you want
to go on now?

337
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,207
Yes, please.

338
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,738
I can tell you,

339
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,367
this is important.

340
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:25,141
- Okay.
- It is crucial that you, yourself,

341
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,547
raise this child.

342
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,413
You mean with Thomas? Is he...?

343
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:33,218
The father of this child will play
no part in its life, nor yours.

344
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,792
- So, what exactly are you saying?
- This child parented by anyone else,

345
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,888
anyone other than you...

346
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:46,463
- Danger surrounds this baby.
- Danger?

347
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,972
Your nature, your spirit,

348
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,669
your goodness must be an influence
in the development of this child.

349
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:02,243
Look, if Thomas and I don't,
you know, get back together,

350
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,414
I'm putting this baby
up for adoption.

351
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:09,393
I just wanted to find out what would
give the baby the happiest life.

352
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:14,398
There is no happy life.
Not for this child, not without you.

353
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,629
- I don't...
- There can't be another.

354
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,966
You mustn't allow another
to raise your baby.

355
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,565
Okay. Great.
Thanks for taking my 200.

356
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,908
Look, take it. Miss Littleton,
I am begging you just to consider...

357
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,437
- I can't raise this child by myself.
- You have to listen to me!

358
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,484
Thanks for your time
and my money back!

359
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,577
The baby needs your protection!

360
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,190
Miss Littleton! Please!

361
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,540
<i>- Hello?
- Miss Littleton, it's Richard Malkin. </i>

362
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:59,736
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Listen to me. I have a plan, </i>

363
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,938
<i>something that will
make this all better. </i>

364
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,107
You've got to stop calling me.
It's too late, all right?

365
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,413
I'm going to see
Adoptive Services tomorrow.

366
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,386
<i>I've been telling you for months, 
you cannot do that. </i>

367
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,980
What I do with my baby
is none of your business.

368
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:14,821
<i>If you don't do
what I'm suggesting, </i>

369
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,554
<i>great danger will befall... </i>

370
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,620
Great danger will befall you
if you don't stop calling me

371
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,792
<i>- In the middle of the night.
- I know what you're feeling inside. </i>

372
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,301
<i>You're doubting your decision
to give up the baby. </i>

373
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,862
<i>Look, I'm begging you, don't do it. 
At least hear my plan first. </i>

374
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,965
Good night.

375
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,679
Hi.

376
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,748
- Where are you going?
- Back to the beach.

377
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:47,019
- Well, what happened? Did Jack...?
- Jack tried to dope me.

378
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,493
He thinks I'm making all this up,
that none of it really happened.

379
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,258
Right. So, to prove your sanity,

380
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:57,233
you go tromping through
the jungle alone. Well done.

381
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,065
I'm not crazy, Charlie.

382
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,982
You want my information?

383
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,113
Name: Shannon Rutherford.

384
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,955
Age: 20.
Address: Craphole Island.

385
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,962
So, uh, where were
you guys last night?

386
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,123
Um, the beach.

387
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,102
Why the interrogation?

388
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,729
You're like the twentieth person
to ask me that.

389
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,365
Why is everyone uptight
about answering questions?

390
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,636
Well, maybe we're just
not cool with you

391
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,440
setting up your own
little Patriot Act, man.

392
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,572
He's a liberal.

393
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,775
- Seriously, why the list?
- It's nothing.

394
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,944
We had an incident
in the valley last night.

395
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,420
- An incident?
- Yeah, Claire, the pregnant girl.

396
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:56,119
You know her?
She, uh, kind of got attacked.

397
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,560
- What?
- She okay?

398
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,657
- Yeah, she's a little shook up, but...
- I am not moving to the Rape Caves.

399
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,936
Your life would be much easier
if you just had the manifest.

400
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,974
We crossed out names of the dead
after we burned the fuselage,

401
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,134
so should be a full roster
of the rest of us.

402
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,337
What? Really? Who has it?

403
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,341
Who do you think?

404
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,989
I'm just gonna lay it out straight.

405
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,653
Okay, you do that.

406
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,993
I hear you have
the flight manifest,

407
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,932
and I need it
and want you to give it to me.

408
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,996
- That so?
- Now, you could do what you normally do

409
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,666
when someone asks for something,
tell me to screw off.

410
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:49,043
- Screw off?
- Or you could just give it to me.

411
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:54,115
'Cause, dude,
you could use the points.

412
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,551
Well, gosh, you sure know how
to butter a man up, Stay-Puff.

413
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,649
It's a gift.

414
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,031
Manifest is in
the brown suitcase. Take it.

415
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,501
- Please let me carry your bag.
- I'm fine.

416
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,665
I know you're fine,
but I can carry your bag.

417
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,470
Why did you come after me?

418
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,001
Well, it's probably
because I like you.

419
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,815
- What?
- You don't like me, Charlie, okay?

420
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,683
You just want
to rescue me because I'm...

421
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,881
Because of this.

422
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:35,687
But I'm fine, okay? I don't
need rescuing. I don't need...

423
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,427
- Claire? What is it?

424
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,266
What? Claire, what?
What is it?

425
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,938
- Was that another one?
- Yeah.

426
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,569
We need to time the contractions.
That's what you do.

427
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,741
Time the contractions, okay? One sugar
plum fairy, two sugar plum fairy...

428
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,545
You just need to calm down,
all right? Big deep breaths.

429
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,914
- Bloody hell.
- I need you to go get Jack.

430
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,356
- I'll be all right.
- I'm not leaving you alone.

431
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,860
- I can deliver a baby. I can do this.
- Please, go!

432
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,760
- You don't know how to...
- Listen.

433
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,321
I might not know what I'm doing,
but I'll figure it out.

434
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,460
If I can kick drugs,
I can deliver a baby.

435
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:23,064
Let me explain. I'm a drug addict.
I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.

436
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,837
- Get Jack!
- Right.

437
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,754
Arlene and Joseph
will bring you to Melbourne.

438
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,919
They'll pay your
living and medical expenses.

439
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,829
We found you an apartment.
It's a really nice two-bedroom place,

440
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,766
and we think you're
gonna be really comfortable in it.

441
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,464
As discussed, once the baby's born
and handed over to the Stewarts,

442
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,769
you'll have no right
to see the child again.

443
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,435
You'll have no right
to correspond with the child,

444
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,603
it will be entirely up
to Arlene and Joseph

445
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,980
to decide whether to tell the child
anything about you. Understood?

446
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,115
- Yes.
- Upon your discharge from the hospital,

447
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,954
you will be given an
additional payment of $20,000.

448
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,590
I just want to make sure that you're
gonna take really good care of the baby.

449
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,828
Of course we will.

450
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,304
Now, I'll need you to sign
and date here where indicated.

451
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:40,813
<i>Do you know Catch a Falling Star? </i>

452
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,785
It's a song, like a lullaby.

453
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,652
"Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket."

454
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:51,017
My dad used to sing
that to me when I was little.

455
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:57,233
Do you think you could sing it
to the baby once in a while?

456
00:33:57,301 --> 00:34:00,327
Of course.

457
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,550
It's not working.

458
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,487
Here.

459
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:51,684
I'm...

460
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,883
I'm... I'm sorry.

461
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:59,555
- I can't do this.
- What? No! No!

462
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,201
Okay, what is it?
What's your offer?

463
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,476
- Thank God! What's your name?
- Ethan. Are you all right?

464
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,611
Go the caves.
Run to the caves. Get Jack.

465
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,588
- Tell him Claire...
- Claire. She okay?

466
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:29,422
She's having the baby. Go fast, okay?
I'll be with her, on the path there. Go!

467
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,942
- Claire!
- I'm here!

468
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,742
Claire! Okay, Jack's coming.

469
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,840
- How you doing?
- It hurts.

470
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,977
Okay, just take my hand.
Squeeze. Okay, breathe.

471
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,490
Inhale. Exhale.
Good. Just breathe.

472
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,923
Inhale. Okay, good.

473
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,762
- Oh, I'm not supposed to be here.
- We all feel like that a little bit.

474
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,700
I know. It's just...

475
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,169
Someone promised me
it would be different.

476
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,639
Well, he was wrong.

477
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,710
Yeah. He was wrong.

478
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,407
You spent the last
four months telling me

479
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,780
I have to raise the baby myself.

480
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,513
Now you're giving me money
and saying I don't have to?

481
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,148
I found a couple in Los Angeles
who are very eager to adopt.

482
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,057
The baby will be safe in their care.

483
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,891
- Now, I've foreseen...
- You've foreseen.

484
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,158
I don't even know
why I'm here. I'm sorry.

485
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:45,100
I know this sounds ridiculous,
Claire, all this psychic business,

486
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:49,196
and I appreciate that you must
think I'm a raving madman.

487
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,538
But this is what must happen.

488
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,409
So you're giving me $6,000

489
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:03,385
to give my baby to a couple
of strangers in Los Angeles?

490
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:07,891
$12,000. The other six
when you arrive in Los Angeles.

491
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,725
And they're not strangers, Claire.
They're good people.

492
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:19,733
- A psychic?
- I know. It's embarrassing.

493
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:24,104
And after everything,
he was just full of it.

494
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,780
Or not.

495
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:36,583
I mean, all he wanted

496
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,815
was that no one else
raise your baby, right?

497
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,560
Maybe he knew.

498
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,629
I mean,
if you wanted it bad enough...

499
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:52,260
You know, if he had the gift,

500
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,770
and I believe some people do...

501
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,603
Maybe he knew, Claire.

502
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,151
I can't go tomorrow.
I have to get my...

503
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,819
It has to be this flight.
It can't be any other.

504
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:20,990
They're already scheduled to meet you
when you arrive. Flight 815.

505
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,397
Flight 815.

506
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,612
There was no couple in Los Angeles.

507
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,476
<i>He knew. </i>

508
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,283
<i>He knew about the plane, </i>

509
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,515
<i>what was gonna happen... </i>

510
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,126
<i>Oh, my God, he knew. </i>

511
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,868
- You feel another one coming?
- I don't think so.

512
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,976
Where the hell is Jack?

513
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,516
You know, I think...

514
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,715
- I think I'm all right.
- The contractions?

515
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,887
Maybe that was the last one.

516
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,829
Please, let that
have been the last one.

517
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:34,636
Jack said that stress
can cause a false labor.

518
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,403
You sure you're all right?

519
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,539
No pain.

520
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:45,512
Birthing emergency averted.

521
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,744
I told you I'd take care of you.

522
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,612
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You're quite welcome.

523
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,756
You think you can
make it back to the caves?

524
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,890
I won't let anything happen to you.

525
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,362
- Okay.
- Okay.

526
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,270
Let's go.

527
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,407
Sayid.

528
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,969
Listen to me.

529
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,321
I found her, the Frenchwoman.

530
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,915
I need some water.

531
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,586
- What happened?
- The woman on the island...

532
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,101
I had to come back.
I had to come back.

533
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,579
We're not alone.

534
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,929
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, he just kicked.

535
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,133
Here.

536
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,272
We got a problem.

537
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,442
The manifest.

538
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:29,680
Jack, the census,
the names of everyone who survived.

539
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:31,084
All 46 of us.

540
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,988
I interviewed everyone,
here, at the beach.

541
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,824
I got their names. One of them...
One of them isn't...

542
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,420
Jack.

543
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,331
One of them isn't in the manifest.

544
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,965
He wasn't on the plane.

545
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,997
Hello, there.

546
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:56,213
Ethan, where's Jack?
