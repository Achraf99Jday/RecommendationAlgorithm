1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,392
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,528
Three points of a triangle.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:08,040
One here on the beach. Another,
Kate will position in the jungle

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,338
roughly two kilometers in.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,174
And the third,
I'll take to high ground.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,776
Where are you?
Where are you?

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,484
Mayday! Mayday!
Anybody out there? Hello!

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,686
We're survivors of the crash
of Oceanic flight 815.

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,751
Please copy.

10
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,901
John, tell me exactly
what happened.

11
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,334
John? Locke!

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:45,344
- It fell... the plane.
- Locke said you fell from a cliff.

13
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:48,381
- It's because of the hatch.
- What hatch?

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,110
John said not to tell.

15
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,846
What'd Locke do?

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,547
- Where's Shannon?
- I don't know.

17
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,250
- Well, she's his sister...
- I don't know where she is!

18
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:25,416
Jack. Where are you going?

19
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:27,510
To find John Locke.

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,442
Is there anything
I can do for you?

21
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,789
Sun said he wouldn't let
Jack take his leg.

22
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,127
Didn't want him using up
the antibiotics.

23
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:22,071
She said he knew
what was happening to him.

24
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,133
That he was brave.

25
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,514
<i>This is a special
security announcement. </i>

26
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,255
<i>Heathrow Airport Authority
reminds traveling passengers... </i>

27
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,947
Okay, Sayid.

28
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,184
Eighteen hours
in a holding cell should be enough.

29
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,724
Let's get to it, shall we?

30
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,022
I'm Melissa Cole
from Central Intelligence.

31
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,790
This is Robbie Hewitt from ASIS.

32
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,800
- You're gonna do us a favor.
- A favor?

33
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,632
Three hundred pounds
of C-4 explosives were stolen

34
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,831
from an army base
outside of Melbourne.

35
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,602
The men responsible
are members of a terrorist cell

36
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,736
intent on disrupting
the coalition presence in Iraq.

37
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,474
Three hundred pounds of C-4.

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,947
I want it back.

39
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,047
You're the CIA.

40
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,086
- Plant a few bugs.
- Oh, we have.

41
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,487
- You're gonna get inside first...
- I am Iraqi.

42
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,184
I am not a terrorist.

43
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,524
We didn't snatch you up
because you were a terrorist, Sayid.

44
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,531
We snatched you up
because you know one.

45
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,561
Essam Tazir.
Your roommate at Cairo University.

46
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,733
- He's a member of the cell.
- And why should I care?

47
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,505
- You'd be saving lives.
- I repeat. Why should I care?

48
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,943
We know where she is.

49
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,243
Seven years since you left Iraq.

50
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,685
Six months here,
three months there.

51
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,188
Always moving.

52
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,420
There's only two reasons
why a man would do that, Sayid.

53
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,757
Either he's running away
from something,

54
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,820
or looking for something.

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,258
Noor Abed Jaseem.

56
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,403
Nobody calls her Noor.

57
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,309
You want to know
where she is?

58
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,907
Then we're going to Sydney.

59
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,175
Kate, what are you doing out here?

60
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:24,053
- Looking for you.
- Well, you found me.

61
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,553
You're walking in circles.
You need to come back.

62
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,095
Not without Locke.

63
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,724
- You haven't slept, gave Boone blood...
- Locke lied.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,030
- Well, now you're...
- He lied, Kate.

65
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,935
Boone did not fall off any cliff.

66
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,406
His leg was crushed.

67
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,808
And I based my
medical treatment on his lie.

68
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,939
People are scared and upset.

69
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,180
They don't know what's going on.

70
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,045
We need you to come back, Jack.

71
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,116
Please?

72
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,895
Shannon.

73
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,700
Do you wanna...?

74
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,438
Do you wanna say something?

75
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,977
No.

76
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,819
I didn't know Boone very well,

77
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,419
and for that I'm sorry.

78
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,930
On our sixth day here,

79
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,732
a woman named Joanna died.

80
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,999
She drowned.

81
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,607
And Boone was the first one
into the water.

82
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,840
I didn't know him.

83
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,418
But I'll remember his courage...

84
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,011
...and I know he will be missed.

85
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,055
It was my fault.

86
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:25,635
We found a plane.
A Beechcraft, in the jungle.

87
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:28,173
It was lodged in the canopy.

88
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,010
I would have gone up,
but...

89
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,116
My leg was hurt, so he...

90
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,461
There was a radio inside,
and he thought he could...

91
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,836
His weight must have made
the plane shift and it fell and...

92
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,075
Happened because
he was trying to help us.

93
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,882
He was a hero.

94
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,884
Where were you?

95
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,998
Where were you?

96
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,301
Where the hell were you,
you son of a bitch?

97
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,236
- What did you do to him?
- Wait! Jack, stop!

98
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,501
- What did you do?
- Wait!

99
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,065
Where were you?

100
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,442
You just left him to die.
You lied to me!

101
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,310
Where were you?

102
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,265
- Jack, it's okay.
- Where were you?

103
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:05,031
- Where were you?
- Jack.

104
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,095
- Jack.
- Hey, hey.

105
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,401
Jack, what's the matter?
Are you okay?

106
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:11,636
Oh, God.

107
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,770
Get some water!

108
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,642
Breathe. He's okay.

109
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,175
Just breathe.

110
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,491
- He's lying.
- You're suffering from fatigue.

111
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,892
- Locke told Boone not to tell.
- Not to tell about what?

112
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,989
Something about a hatch.
Locke's hiding something.

113
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,626
- Jack, listen...
- The man is hiding something.

114
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:37,896
Listen to me.

115
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,837
We need the doctor
on this island to get some sleep.

116
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,568
- I'm fine. I don't need it.
- Jack.

117
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,508
You need some rest.

118
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,638
Come on.

119
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,151
Sayid?

120
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,747
Sayid.

121
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,227
- It is you.
- Essam.

122
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,354
So you haven't forgotten me.

123
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,191
Hardly.

124
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,028
- What are you doing in Sydney?
- I've been traveling. And you?

125
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,700
I live here.
Almost a year now.

126
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,973
- I'm a tree cutter. I cut trees.
- Sounds like good, honest work.

127
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,980
So much for my philosophy degree.

128
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,879
Whatever puts food on your table.

129
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,611
How is Zahraa?

130
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,418
She died.

131
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,892
A stray bomb, while she
was shopping for a dress.

132
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,197
I'm so sorry.

133
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,428
Listen, we've got
a lot of catching up to do.

134
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,334
Why don't you come over?

135
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,833
I'd love to.

136
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,941
Damn it. I'm out of ammo.

137
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,881
- Use the crowbar.
- That only works on the zombies.

138
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,181
- Not the big bugs.
- Indeed.

139
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,686
The three of you live here?

140
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,690
Sydney's very expensive.
It's the best we can afford.

141
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,090
And what is it you do?

142
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:46,261
- At the moment, I'm at liberty.
- He's on holiday.

143
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,993
You'll love the beaches here.

144
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:51,002
There is something to be said
for Australian women.

145
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,967
I've had the misfortune of being
landlocked for several years.

146
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,980
The last beach I was at
was Sharm El Sheikh

147
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,913
with you, Essam, remember?

148
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,884
Before our English exams?

149
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,785
I hear the beaches here are very nice.

150
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,823
Especially the women.

151
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,124
Perhaps we can go.

152
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,963
So tell me, exactly
what kind of trees do you cut?

153
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,916
- Who are you?
- I was a communications officer.

154
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,451
Sayid was Republican Guard.
He knows things.

155
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,158
Perhaps it's not happenstance

156
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,355
that you and Essam
met at the mosque.

157
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,696
Perhaps it is fate.

158
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,105
It's okay.

159
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,704
Look, I'm fine. Really. Okay?

160
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,216
You need rest, Claire.
Sun, tell her.

161
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,752
In a hospital,
they would have you sleep.

162
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,685
The nurses would take your baby.

163
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,120
But I'm not in a hospital.

164
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,990
All the more reason
to take extra care, Claire.

165
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,325
I can take care of
Turnip-Head for a while.

166
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,863
Turnip-Head?

167
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,491
It's what I'm calling him
till you give him a name.

168
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,502
'Cause his head
looks like a turnip.

169
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,130
What if he needs something, okay?

170
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,106
You'll be there after you sleep.

171
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,938
No, okay. No.

172
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,807
Claire, no one is going to take
this baby away from you.

173
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,580
You don't know that.
You can't say that.

174
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,416
I won't let it happen.

175
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,053
Just be really careful, okay?

176
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,529
If he gets hot,
take his blanket off.

177
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:03,034
- His neck. Around his neck.
- I got him.

178
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:17,539
This was his.

179
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,844
I didn't go through it.

180
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,417
Thank you.

181
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,825
You're welcome.

182
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,332
Storm coming.

183
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,911
I should have said no.

184
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,945
First time he offered to hunt with me,
I should have said no.

185
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,346
He would've gone anyway.

186
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,153
Yeah, I suppose he would've.

187
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,497
I know how confused and angry
you must be right now.

188
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,266
I can't say I understand
what you're going through, but...

189
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,007
I know what it feels like
when you lose family.

190
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,013
I hope you can forgive me.

191
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,725
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,678
You asked if you could
do anything for me.

193
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,526
Anything.

194
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,159
John Locke killed my brother.

195
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,367
Will you do something about that?

196
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,808
- A little more.
- No.

197
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,547
- You need your blood sugar level up.
- Enough already. I've rested.

198
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,916
- Jack...
- I'm fine.

199
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,651
Where are you going?

200
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,484
- I'm gonna talk to Locke.
- You need to lie down.

201
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,725
- No, I don't.
- I strongly advise it.

202
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,461
You advise? Advice?

203
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,060
What...?
All right, what's going on now?

204
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,867
Lie down. Okay?

205
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,442
I crushed up some sleeping pills,
put 'em in your juice.

206
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,779
Why would you...?
You drugged me?

207
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,947
Yeah.

208
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,624
Okay.

209
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,569
'Night.

210
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,796
How did you get that?

211
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,605
War wound.

212
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,873
- Looks more like a surgical scar.
- Like I said, war wound.

213
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:14,279
The plane's radio.
Was Boone able to pick up a signal?

214
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,186
I was on the ground.
All I could hear was static.

215
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,690
- So it was working.
- Yeah.

216
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,056
But I can't imagine
it survived the fall.

217
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,023
Some of its parts might work in the
transmitter I'm building for the raft...

218
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,967
...if you'd be willing to take me.

219
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,238
Of course.

220
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,744
- How did you find this plane?
- Luck.

221
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,302
You and Boone were hunting?

222
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,112
- That a question?
- Yes.

223
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,476
Boar got scarce
a couple weeks back.

224
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,682
We weren't hunting,
we were exploring.

225
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,988
So you just happened upon
a Beechcraft perched in the trees?

226
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,391
Yep.

227
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,660
At the funeral, you said
your leg was injured.

228
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,098
It was just a charley horse.

229
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,330
- A cramp.
- I know what a charley horse is, John.

230
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,371
Back in Iraq,
you were an interrogator?

231
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,238
- Is that a question?
- Yeah.

232
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,477
A long time ago, I was.

233
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,712
Well, you haven't lost your touch.

234
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,119
Why would I interrogate you, John?

235
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,892
Jack called me a liar in front of
every man, woman and child

236
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,453
I've come to know
over the past month.

237
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,262
There's a part of you that thinks
maybe there isn't a plane here at all.

238
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,668
I know when I'm being lied to.

239
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,733
There's a plane.

240
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,322
Like I said,
you haven't lost your touch.

241
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,296
You've lost your edge,
old man.

242
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,094
I never had one
when I played you.

243
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,599
Were you always this slow?

244
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:10,862
Come on, let's play.

245
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,565
You have to get out of that apartment.
Practice more.

246
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,972
Haddad would like that.

247
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,101
More blending in
with the community.

248
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,940
He's got his eye on a target.

249
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,246
What makes you say that?

250
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,284
For two weeks, he's been
asking me about explosives.

251
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,115
Blast radius. Transport.

252
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,950
Haddad's very thorough.

253
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,082
Has he gotten hold of any yet?

254
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,820
Explosives? I don't know.

255
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:40,154
All I know is there's going
to be an operation.

256
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,096
And there is going to be a martyr.

257
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,233
You?

258
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,968
Haddad told me this morning.

259
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,114
Come on, let's keep playing.

260
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,650
- Essam.
- I'm going to wipe the floor with you.

261
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,345
What is it?

262
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,251
What is it?

263
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,882
I don't think I can do it.

264
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,196
- You're kidding me, right?
- Listen to me.

265
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,892
I can get Essam to turn himself in.

266
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:18,493
- Does he know where the C-4 is?
- The other two are the ones you want.

267
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,130
- Essam's confused...
- Does he know where it is?

268
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,675
- No.
- Then he's useless.

269
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,473
These cells run top down.
It's all need-to-know.

270
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,448
The recruit's handed a bomb and a target
at the last possible moment.

271
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,748
The way to find the C-4 is wait for
Essam to walk out with a target to hit.

272
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,948
He's in over his head,
doesn't know why...

273
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,992
That's why you convince him
to go through with it.

274
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,293
No.

275
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,156
No. I will not.

276
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,291
- Excuse me?
- I'm done. It's over.

277
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,802
You're not even close
to being done, my friend.

278
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,566
- What are you going to do, arrest me?
- No.

279
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,539
We'll arrest her.

280
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,203
Your girlfriend's an Iraqi living abroad
with a record of insurgency.

281
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:07,580
Wouldn't it be terrible if she
got picked up as an enemy combatant?

282
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,889
So, if you want any chance
of ever seeing her again,

283
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,255
go and talk
your good friend Essam

284
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,317
into blowing himself up.

285
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,361
<i>* The itsy-bitsy spider</i>

286
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,063
<i>* Climbed up the spout</i>

287
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,802
<i>* Down came the rain
and drowned the spider out</i>

288
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,276
<i>- * When the... 
- Dude, it's "washed."</i>

289
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,813
"Washed the spider out."

290
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,349
Unless there's some
kind of British version.

291
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,475
Okay.

292
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,352
<i>* Down came the rain
and washed the spider... </i>

293
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,756
- Oh, bollocks. Shh. Shush.
- What's the matter, man?

294
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,226
I can't get the bloody thing
to stop crying.

295
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:51,421
Maybe he's hungry.

296
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,862
No. Claire nursed him five times.

297
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,765
He make any deposits,
you know, diaper-wise?

298
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:03,963
All right.

299
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,239
Time to break out the big guns.

300
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,447
<i>* Whoa! I feel good</i>

301
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,247
<i>* I knew that I would, now</i>

302
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,447
<i>* I feel good</i>

303
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,815
<i>* I knew that I would, now</i>

304
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,791
<i>* So good
So good</i>

305
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,161
<i>* I got you
Bom-bom-bom-bom</i>

306
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,097
Ow!

307
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,668
Dude, that's all I got.

308
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,245
Heroin.

309
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,147
Cargo hold is full of it.

310
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,778
Best I can figure,
they were smugglers.

311
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,286
The plane was perched
in the canopy?

312
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,993
Right up there.

313
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,791
And Boone climbed up by himself,
because of your charley horse.

314
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,165
Yes. That's right.

315
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,062
Why did you lie?

316
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,637
I made a mistake.

317
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,440
I'm going to salvage
what I can of the radio.

318
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,646
If we leave now, we should
beat the storm back.

319
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,063
Why don't you trust me, Sayid?

320
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,192
For one thing.

321
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,529
You've been carrying a gun
you've told no one about.

322
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,707
We found one of the smugglers
about half a click west of here

323
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,077
dressed as a priest,
Nigerian currency in his pockets.

324
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,672
And this.

325
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,082
Now you're armed and I'm not.

326
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,854
Does that earn me any trust?

327
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,523
You gave this to me
because I caught you concealing it.

328
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:09,123
That earns you adaptability.

329
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,464
I'll tell you something
you don't know.

330
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,301
Please do.

331
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:19,375
A week after the crash,
there was a cave-in.

332
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,208
- Jack was trapped. Remember?
- Of course.

333
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,310
You, Kate and Sawyer

334
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,476
went out into the jungle
to triangulate a signal.

335
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,513
Yes.

336
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,954
You were hit,
knocked unconscious.

337
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,550
When you woke up, the transceiver,
your equipment was destroyed.

338
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,467
That was me.

339
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:55,202
This is one time you better
not be telling the truth.

340
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,148
- It was in everyone's interest.
- Ruined my chance to find the source...

341
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:03,051
Of a distress call saying,
"They're dead. It killed 'em all."

342
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,488
Is that a place you really want
to lead people to?

343
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,630
Why wait all this time?
Why not tell me then?

344
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:16,428
Because back then you wouldn't have
engaged in a reasonable debate.

345
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,698
Nobody else would. You were
so focused to get off the island

346
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,504
you weren't seeing things clearly,
like what's happening with the raft.

347
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,478
- Did you burn the raft?
- No, Sayid, I didn't.

348
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,378
What is the hatch?

349
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,678
The hatch?

350
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,315
Boone mentioned it
before he died.

351
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,286
The hatch?

352
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:52,461
Two hatches on a plane.
Could be forward... or aft.

353
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,480
I'm not sure if I can do this.

354
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,582
You wouldn't be a martyr if you
didn't have to overcome fear.

355
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,949
I'm not afraid to die.

356
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,979
It's all the innocent lives,
all those people.

357
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:15,549
The imam preaches peace, Sayid,

358
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,221
that every human life is sacred.

359
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,198
It's true. Innocent lives will be lost,
in service of a greater good.

360
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,963
What if I'm doing this
because I'm angry?

361
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,803
What if I'm doing this
because they killed her?

362
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,568
What if you are?

363
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,914
Should we just accept
what happened to Zahraa?

364
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,080
What about others like her?
We just accept their deaths?

365
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:49,525
Because if we do, it means
ultimately we care nothing about them.

366
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,725
I lost someone too, Essam.

367
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,540
I will never be whole again.

368
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,210
There need to be consequences
for those responsible.

369
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,148
That's my duty.
That is how I will honor her.

370
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,752
Haddad was right.

371
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,317
It was fate that
brought us back together.

372
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,294
Sayid...

373
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,564
...will you do this with me?

374
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,831
I will.

375
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,857
How are you?

376
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,872
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Sure.

377
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,203
- I spoke to Locke.
- What did he say?

378
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,748
He took me to the plane.

379
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,751
I believe what happened
was an accident.

380
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,650
Then why did he lie?

381
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,684
I have no idea.

382
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,386
But I don't believe
he meant to harm Boone.

383
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,019
So that's it?

384
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,960
I know how strong the need
can be to find someone to blame...

385
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,899
You don't get it, do you?

386
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:42,632
- Shannon.
- Just forget about it, okay?

387
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,307
How much weight can this hold?

388
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,017
I don't know.

389
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,647
A lot. Enough.

390
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,387
Yeah. Tighter. Got it.

391
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,689
- What if it tips over?
- It won't.

392
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,460
That's why we made it this wide.

393
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,964
There, that should do it.

394
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,163
Right? Good?

395
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,196
Good.

396
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,537
- All right.
- What if a shark attacks?

397
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,014
Sharks ain't getting
anywhere near us, man.

398
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,677
What if we die?

399
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,056
We are not gonna die.

400
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,686
Boone died.

401
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:44,560
Michael, do you know
anything about babies?

402
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,399
I can't get this guy to be quiet.

403
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:50,168
- Walk with him. He'll calm down.
- I tried that.

404
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,540
- Jin, have you seen Sun?
- Huh?

405
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,239
Sun. I need some help
with this baby.

406
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,442
- No.
- Okay.

407
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,580
Chucky, you wanna
keep that kid quiet?

408
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,716
Baby Huey's
like nails on a chalkboard.

409
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:11,952
Aww, there you go.
You happy now?

410
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,058
I was.

411
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,162
If you're gonna play nursemaid
at least do the damn job.

412
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,069
Hey.
Hey, say something else.

413
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,544
- Just say something, say anything.
- Okay, fine.

414
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,014
I liked that thing a lot better
inside than I like it outside.

415
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:38,949
What?

416
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,027
Hey.

417
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,641
Brought you something to eat.

418
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,050
- What's in it? Chloroform?
- Soup.

419
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:11,778
Thanks, but I think I'll...

420
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,020
- Who was in here?
- I don't know. What's the matter?

421
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,657
- Was anybody in here?
- No, why are you...?

422
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,930
The key to the gun case.
It's gone.

423
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:28,463
- Maybe it fell off this morning.
- It didn't.

424
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,865
What's going on?

425
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,434
Locke took the key.
He's after the guns.

426
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,673
I haven't seen him.
You don't know...

427
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,978
- No? Then who was it?
- Jack.

428
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,548
It wasn't Locke.

429
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,138
Sayid.

430
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,710
Get in.

431
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,246
It's time.

432
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:46,474
Stay relaxed and focused.
Drive with the windows down.

433
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,042
The fresh air will keep you alert.

434
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,214
You will need to wear these.

435
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,824
If you run into any problems...

436
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,324
...use this.

437
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,460
You are heroes.

438
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,671
Good luck.

439
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,595
Essam, stop.

440
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,000
Don't be nervous, brother.
We'll be okay.

441
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm working with the CIA.

442
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,240
What?

443
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,335
I'm going to give you ten minutes
to get away before I call them.

444
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:52,279
- You set me up?
- Essam, just go.

445
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,818
- Why would you do this to me?
- You're wasting time.

446
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:58,287
We were going to do this together.
You said you lost someone.

447
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,125
Her name is Nadia.

448
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,628
We were separated years ago.

449
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,632
They know where I can find her.

450
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,669
You used me to find a woman?

451
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,886
- You talked me into this.
- Essam, don't.

452
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,685
- It was for the greater good.
- I'm begging you to go.

453
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,886
You said you were my brother.
You're supposed to be my friend!

454
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:38,826
I am your friend.

455
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:41,126
A friend who told me
to do this for Zahraa,

456
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,657
just so you could find
some woman that you love?

457
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:57,771
Well, Sayid, I hope
she makes you whole again.

458
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,248
Essam!

459
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,263
Go!

460
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,557
Go.

461
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,906
She doesn't believe me, Sayid.

462
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,481
Shannon.

463
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,515
Shannon.

464
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:41,456
- Please listen to me.
- He did it. I know it.

465
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,288
You're not thinking rationally.

466
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,726
You've never fired a gun before.

467
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:55,696
- Shannon. You don't want to do this.
- Yes, I do.

468
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:59,334
If you do it,
you can never take it back.

469
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,914
Stay back!

470
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,481
What did you do to him?

471
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,084
I told you it was an accident.

472
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:15,781
Shannon.

473
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,452
Jack, you told me he was a liar.

474
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,967
No!

475
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,877
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

476
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,689
- Get away.
- Shannon.

477
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,189
"The low rumble
breaks the crisp fall air

478
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:23,352
as a flash of red streaks down
the maple-dappled Vermont highway."

479
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,494
"The 32-valve V8 engine purrs
as the transmission clicks down a gear

480
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,626
and the vehicle
unleashes 400 horses

481
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,695
<i>and 350 poundlfeet
of rear-wheel torque."</i>

482
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,971
Keep going. Keep going!

483
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,842
- Charlie...
- Shh.

484
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,747
"Beneath the hood,
the 4.4- liter power plant

485
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,844
features an integrated supercharger
mated to a six-speed transmission

486
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,515
with a manual
sequential shift feature."

487
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,550
Keep going.

488
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,193
"This smooth-riding sports car

489
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,257
offers a bewitching blend of pace,
comfort and economy."

490
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:22,744
She just needs time.

491
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,811
She's been through a lot.

492
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,151
Time won't make a difference.

493
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,061
Perhaps I made a mistake.

494
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,257
You couldn't let her kill Locke.
You had no choice.

495
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,432
There's always a choice.

496
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,608
She lives in Irvine, California,
just south of Los Angeles.

497
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,205
Works as a lab tech
in a medical testing company.

498
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,911
Plane ticket.
Walking around money.

499
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:58,944
You're on an Oceanic flight to LA.
It leaves in two hours.

500
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,150
What happens to his body?

501
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,820
He was a terrorist, so he's
not exactly getting a state funeral.

502
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,125
What happens to his body?

503
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:15,061
After it's released,
he'll be cremated.

504
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,164
A Muslim man
is supposed to be buried.

505
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,801
Yeah? Well, there's
no one to claim the body.

506
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,174
I'll claim him.

507
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,509
You can't claim him
on a plane in two hours.

508
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:26,482
Then change my flight to tomorrow.

509
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,390
How's your head?

510
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,862
- It'll heal.
- Another war wound.

511
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,171
I know what it cost you...

512
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,513
...to do what you did.

513
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,241
Thank you.

514
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,053
I did it because I sense

515
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,556
you might be our best hope
of surviving here.

516
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,888
But I don't forgive what you did,

517
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,692
and I certainly don't trust you.

518
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,000
And now, you're going
to take me to the hatch.

519
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,574
- Hatch? I already showed you...
- John.

520
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,409
No more lies.
