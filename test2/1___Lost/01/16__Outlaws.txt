00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,299
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,601
- How many drinks did you have, Dad?
- Are you lecturing me?

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,107
The nurses told me
that your hands were shaking.

4
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,302
In my professional opinion,

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,608
by the time I was called in,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,841
the damage was irreversible.

7
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,282
I need to...  
revise my statement.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,150
I didn't come into the OR
until well into the procedure.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,713
- This is not...
- It was clear that my father

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,385
severed the patient's
hepatic artery,

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:30,524
which,
in my professional opinion,

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,224
led to her death.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,796
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,
you don't know who I am,

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,599
but I know what you've done.

15
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,571
You had sex with my mother,

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,200
and then you stole
my dad's money all away.

17
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:46,143
I'm going to find you
and give you this letter

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,203
so you'll remember
what you done to me."

19
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,612
I looked at the envelope.

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,545
You wrote this letter.

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,087
Your name's not Sawyer, is it?

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,919
It was his name.
He was a confidence man.

23
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,357
Romanced my mama
to get to the money.

24
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,759
Wiped them out clean,
left a mess behind.

25
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,228
You were just a kid.

26
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,529
- Wake up.
- Open this door!

27
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,540
- He's here.
- Open this door!

28
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,600
Come on. Got to get you up.

29
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,841
He'll think you're still
with your grandparents, okay?

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,610
Get under the bed.

31
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,776
Let's go. Okay.
Listen to Mommy.

32
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,013
This is important.
Get under the bed.

33
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,750
- Don't make a sound. Don't come out.
- Open this door!

34
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,260
No matter what happens,
don't come out, okay?

35
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,693
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

36
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,399
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mommy.

37
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,095
Let's go. Down you go.

38
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,400
- All right.
- Brooke, open this door!

39
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,271
Stop it!

40
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,674
Stop it!

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,843
Go away!

42
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:57,181
Stop it!

43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,650
What the hell
is wrong with you?

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,949
I'm calling the police!
Get out of here!

45
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,579
What are you doing?

46
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,146
What are you doing with a gun?

47
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,926
Ah!

48
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,779
<i>It'll come back around. </i>

49
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,576
Boar took your tarp?

50
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,579
It was dark, but, yeah,
pretty sure it was a boar.

51
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,410
I thought the boar had vacated.

52
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,144
Well, genius, I think
we got some bad info.

53
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,283
What was it doing
inside your tent?

54
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,844
It was staring at me.

55
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,717
Then it came at me, so I hit it,
and it ran off into the jungle.

56
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,057
With your tarp.

57
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,427
Perhaps he wanted to go camping.

58
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,429
You enjoying yourself?

59
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,362
Yes.

60
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,863
Well...

61
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,370
Laugh it up, Mohammed.

62
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:14,713
But I come back and find my
stuff's gone, I'm coming after you.

63
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,952
Sayid.

64
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,660
What did you hear?

65
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,561
After you ran into the Frenchwoman,
you heard something in the jungle.

66
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,002
I was injured
and I was exhausted.

67
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,542
- My mind was playing tricks.
- What did you hear?

68
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,312
I thought I heard whispering.

69
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,807
What was it saying?

70
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,346
Why? Did you hear something?

71
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,460
Forget it.

72
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,052
I didn't hear anything.

73
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you so afraid of?

74
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,445
You're the one trembling,
sweetness.

75
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,092
Okay, this is really awkward.

76
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,258
But if I don't say something now,

77
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,892
things are liable to get
downright embarrassing.

78
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:45,233
- Hibbs.
- Hello, Sawyer.

79
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,669
Ma'am, I must apologize.

80
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,367
I figured my good friend
Sawyer here would be alone.

81
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,569
I just need a few minutes.

82
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,043
- Listen, baby...
- Baby, who is this?

83
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,106
Listen. You go down to the bar.
You get a drink.

84
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,674
I don't want to leave you.

85
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,619
As soon as I get rid of him,
then I'll come get you

86
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,280
and I'll explain everything.

87
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:08,157
- But...
- Listen. Just trust me on this.

88
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,527
I will find you. I promise.
I promise.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,695
I got to hand it to you, Sawbucks,

90
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,669
how you find women that beautiful
to work your grift.

91
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,432
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
I'm fairly certain

92
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,841
I said I'd kill you
if I ever saw you again.

93
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,779
That's why I'm here.
To make things right.

94
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:32,215
Besides, we both know
you ain't the killing type.

95
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,319
Here.

96
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,659
Figure that makes us even
for the Tampa job.

97
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:50,361
What could possibly make us
even for the Tampa job?

98
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,669
How about the known whereabouts
of the man who ruined your life?

99
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,334
I'm gonna make myself a drink.
You want one?

100
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,642
You remember
old man Parks, right?

101
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,274
Ran capper for us
on that gig in Atlanta?

102
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,079
Yeah, what about him?

103
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,882
He's been working at
an off-track parlor in Sydney.

104
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,256
So last week,
one of his regulars

105
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,056
gets too sauced, runs his mouth off
about his glory days as a grifter.

106
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,630
That guy. Frank Duckett.

107
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,133
Hard-luck case,
gambling addict, alcoholic.

108
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,034
Runs a shrimp truck.

109
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:28,596
Back in the day, this guy Duckett
was quite the hustler.

110
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,539
He ran the romance angle.

111
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,443
Hook the wife,
take the husband for the money.

112
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,107
Was pretty good at it too,
from what I hear.

113
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,276
Until sadly one of his marks,
in despair,

114
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,049
took a gun, shot up his wife
and blew his own head off.

115
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,687
All in front of their little boy.

116
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,652
I paid Tony to pull his jacket.

117
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,526
Turns out Frank Duckett
used to be named Frank Sawyer,

118
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,031
a name I believe
you appropriated for yourself.

119
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,602
This is him?

120
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,937
That's him.

121
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,051
Thanks for the loaner.

122
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,350
Always a pleasure.

123
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,057
Is anyone curious
where they came from?

124
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:30,330
They knew there was a marshal.
They assumed he was traveling alone,

125
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,633
protecting them from terrorists.

126
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,733
Sounds like a good theory to me.

127
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,548
- Did you get all the guns back?
- All except one.

128
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,717
Who?

129
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,651
How about I give you
three guesses?

130
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,020
Sawyer. I can get it back.

131
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,149
Really.

132
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,988
How are you gonna do that?

133
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,892
I speak his language.

134
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,964
You've done this before,
and if I remember it right,

135
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,398
you made out with him,

136
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,096
and he never even had
what you said you could get.

137
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:09,130
Well, I only made out with him
because torturing him didn't work.

138
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,137
Let him keep the gun.
It's not worth it.

139
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,113
Worried he's gonna
shoot me if I ask?

140
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,309
I just don't want you
to owe him anything.

141
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,393
- Hey.
- Hi.

142
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,105
How you feeling?

143
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,948
Very pregnant.

144
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,554
l, um, had some dreams last night.

145
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,489
Actually, more like memories.

146
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,984
You were in them.

147
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,890
Sorry.

148
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,627
Thought I'd see if you wanted
to go for a walk.

149
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,466
Sorry.

150
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,368
I have to...

151
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,463
...do something.

152
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,805
Sure.

153
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,367
See you later, okay?

154
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,281
<i>It'll come back around. </i>

155
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,941
Son of a bitch!

156
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,538
A boar did all this?

157
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,880
Last night, it wrecked my tent.

158
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,284
This morning, when I went
to get my tent back,

159
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,787
it attacks me from behind,

160
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,620
runs off into the jungle
like a coward.

161
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,389
A boar wouldn't just
attack you for no reason.

162
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,953
Thank you, boar expert.

163
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,329
This one did.

164
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,958
It's harassing me.

165
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,269
What are you doing?

166
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,499
- Getting even.
- Would you listen to yourself?

167
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,009
It's a boar.

168
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,046
Just go tell Locke,
and he'll kill it.

169
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,879
- Nope. This is my fight.
- Do you know about hunting boar?

170
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,750
You are gonna
get yourself lost or worse.

171
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,619
- Since when do you care?
- I don't.

172
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,854
Good. Then if you'll excuse me,
I've got some revenge to tend to.

173
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,951
You must be Hibbs's mate.

174
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,158
I did a few jobs with Hibbs
back in the States.

175
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,964
- Nice enough fella.
- He's a son of a bitch.

176
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,366
Right. Indeed he is.

177
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,063
A few disclaimers.

178
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:02,073
Australia doesn't allow
its citizens to carry handguns.

179
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,665
You get nicked with this...

180
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,039
I'm not gonna rat you out.

181
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,044
Secondly, you know,
I've been doing this for a while,

182
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:15,576
and a man who buys a compact.357
with hollow-point loads,

183
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,679
he's not looking
to scare or steal.

184
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,122
He's looking to kill.
When it comes down to it,

185
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,990
if he finds he doesn't have
what it takes to do the job...

186
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,496
Your sales pitch
needs some work.

187
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,691
What I'm saying is,

188
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,030
you look a man in the eye
and point a gun at him,

189
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,569
you find who you really are.

190
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,798
And should you find
you're not a killer,

191
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,933
there's no refund.

192
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,268
Won't be a problem.

193
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,678
Hurley, I appreciate the help,

194
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,449
but you don't have to.

195
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,854
I killed Ethan.
I can bury him.

196
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,826
Yeah, until he rises
from the dead.

197
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,695
Dude, I know how this works.
This is gonna end

198
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:03,132
with you and me running through
the jungle, screaming and crying.

199
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:07,138
He catches me first
because I'm heavy and I get cramps.

200
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,378
Are you all right?

201
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,533
Yo, Sayid.

202
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,468
Can I ask you a question?

203
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,732
Of course.

204
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,331
Did you ever get
that Gulf War Syndrome?

205
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,169
- That was the other side.
- Oh, right.

206
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,916
Then what's the one
when you're all shell-shocked?

207
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,284
- Post-traumatic stress disorder.
- Yeah. Did you ever have that?

208
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,447
Why do you ask?

209
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,422
- I'm worried about Charlie.
- What's wrong with Charlie?

210
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,020
I mean, he killed a guy.
He shot him in the chest four times.

211
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,460
Maybe you should talk to him?

212
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,511
It's a footprint.

213
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,583
Based on the weight and the distance
between strides,

214
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,591
I'd say you've been
following Boone for an hour.

215
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,957
- Look.
- Could be Charlie, I suppose.

216
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,428
I'm tickled you have
an interest in my affairs.

217
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,328
I really am.

218
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,594
Don't take it personal
when I tell you to...

219
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,999
I want carte blanche.

220
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,967
- What?
- It's simple.

221
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,131
You can't track
this boar without help.

222
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,098
Over the last few hours you
have managed to follow the tracks

223
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,510
of humans, birds,
a rock slide, yourself...

224
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,812
Basically everything except boar.

225
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,409
You have no idea
what you're doing.

226
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,155
- Carte blanche...
- "Blank check."

227
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,215
- I know what it means.
- Anytime I want something from you,

228
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,318
medicine, soap, whatever,
I get it, no questions asked.

229
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,858
Take it or leave it.

230
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,769
All right.

231
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,603
You got a deal.

232
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,718
- Where'd you get that?
- The plane.

233
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,885
Jack was looking
for the liquor cart.

234
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,622
It's a good thing
I found it instead, then.

235
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,363
- Got any more of those?
- I got a lot more of everything,

236
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,267
but you ain't got
carte blanche yet.

237
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,836
Is that a no?

238
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,468
All right, sassafras.

239
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,943
But if you want a drink,
you gotta play.

240
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,383
- Play what?
- I never.

241
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,442
What?

242
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,282
I never.

243
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:14,189
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

244
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,260
Call it a way to get to know
each other better.

245
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,029
For example,

246
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,366
- I know you've never been to college.
- And how do you know that?

247
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,496
If you had,
you'd have heard of "I never."

248
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,365
It's simple.

249
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:34,105
You say "I never," and then
you finish the sentence.

250
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,079
If it's something you did,
you drink.

251
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,582
If it's something you
never did, you don't drink.

252
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,880
That makes absolutely no sense.

253
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,444
Learn by example.

254
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,257
I never kissed a man.

255
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,256
Now you drink,

256
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,762
'cause you've kissed a man.

257
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,767
Your turn.

258
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,739
I never implied
that I've been to college

259
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,901
when I never have.

260
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,874
I never been to Disneyland.

261
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,051
Oh, that's just sad.

262
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,449
I never wore pink.

263
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,798
I knew it.

264
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,300
- The '80s.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,035
I never voted Democrat.

266
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,469
I never voted.

267
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,180
I've never been in love.

268
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:47,907
- You've never been in love.
- I ain't drinking, am I?

269
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,151
I've never had
a one-night stand.

270
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,666
Bottoms up, sailor.

271
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,029
- I gotta drink for each one.
- Your turn.

272
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,240
I never been married.

273
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,014
It didn't last very long.

274
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,544
I've never blamed a boar
for all my problems.

275
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,564
I never cared
about having carte blanche

276
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,760
'cause I just wanted
to spend some time

277
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,568
with the only other person
on this island that just don't belong.

278
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,142
I never carried
a letter around for 20 years

279
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,847
because I couldn't
get over my baggage.

280
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,734
I never killed a man.

281
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,231
Well...

282
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,938
...it looks like we got something
in common after all.

283
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:18,194
<i>It'll come back around. </i>

284
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,730
Are you okay?

285
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,641
You're shaking.

286
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,647
I'm fine.

287
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,482
I was just having a...

288
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,462
I can't believe this.

289
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,327
There are hoof marks everywhere.

290
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,631
It ate all our stuff?

291
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,263
Nope. It ate your stuff. Mine's fine.

292
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,205
Oh, that hog is gonna suffer.

293
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,768
I swear to God...

294
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,411
Morning.

295
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,289
What happened to your campsite?

296
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,165
What are you doing
all the way out here?

297
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,330
- Looking for salvage from the crash.
- Find anything useful?

298
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,399
The occasional scrap of metal,
a few bags of coffee.

299
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,502
I picked up your path a mile back.
I thought I'd say howdy.

300
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,548
Oh, son of a... Oh!

301
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,141
Peed on my shirt.
Took my shirt out of the bag

302
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,618
and peed on it.
And you say this ain't personal.

303
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,747
He thinks the boar we're after
has a vendetta against him.

304
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,850
- Uh-huh.
- That's three times it's attacked me.

305
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,226
Maybe it's got your scent.
Doesn't like your cologne.

306
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,824
- I don't wear cologne.
- Yes, you do.

307
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,203
Yeah, well...

308
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,366
- The thing's got it in for me!
- It's a boar, Sawyer.

309
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,144
My sister Jeannie died
when I was a boy.

310
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,751
She fell off the monkey bars
and broke her neck.

311
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,880
And my mother,
well, my foster mother,

312
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,083
she blamed herself, of course.

313
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,592
Thought she wasn't
watching close enough.

314
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:27,257
So she stopped eating,
stopped sleeping.

315
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,300
The neighbors started talking,

316
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,961
afraid she might do something
to herself, I guess.

317
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,202
Ooh, that's good.

318
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,837
Anyway, about six months
after Jeannie's funeral,

319
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,312
this golden retriever
comes up our driveway,

320
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,873
walks right into our house,
sits down on the floor

321
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,386
and looks right at my mother
there on the couch.

322
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,354
And my mother
looks back at the dog.

323
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,756
After about a minute of this,
them staring at each other like that,

324
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:59,126
my mother... burst into tears.

325
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,293
Beautiful dog, no tags, no collar.

326
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,529
Healthy and sweet.

327
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,835
The dog slept in Jeannie's old room
on Jeannie's old bed

328
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,743
and stayed with us until
my mother passed five years later,

329
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,906
then disappeared back to...

330
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,209
...wherever it was she came from
in the first place.

331
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,324
So you're saying the dog
was your sister?

332
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,158
Well, that would be silly.

333
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,130
But my mother thought it was.

334
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,527
Thought that Jeannie
had come back to tell her

335
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,126
the accident wasn't her fault,

336
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,900
let her off the hook.

337
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,482
Good to go.

338
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,463
Only two choices:

339
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:43,023
Shrimp in mild sauce,
shrimp in hot sauce.

340
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,232
Pal?

341
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,781
I'll go with the hot.

342
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,952
Hot it is.

343
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,926
Ah, a fellow American, huh?

344
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,866
Good for you.
You missed the lunch rush.

345
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,706
Whereabouts you from?

346
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,102
Tennessee.

347
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,908
Yeah, I love the South.

348
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,782
Miss those Southern women.

349
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,519
Been in Australia long?

350
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:40,748
Not really.

351
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,522
For what it's worth,
we have a special at the truck here,

352
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,463
half-price for all Americans.

353
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,141
Name's Frank, by the way.

354
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,874
James.

355
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,511
Good to meet you, James.

356
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,724
One shrimp in hot sauce...

357
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,310
- Again.
- Are you sure about that, mate?

358
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:42,412
- Again.
- You tell him, cowboy.

359
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,389
These bastards think Americans can't
hold their liquor.

360
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,890
Look, I...

361
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,485
I hate to hold my hand out,

362
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,361
but I seem to have
misplaced my wallet.

363
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,692
Set him up.

364
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,868
I drink to you.

365
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,540
- What's your name, cowboy?
- Sawyer.

366
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,702
To Sawyer.

367
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:10,737
May he find whatever he's looking for
at the bottom of a glass.

368
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,547
So, Sawyer,

369
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,216
what brings you to Sydney?

370
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,917
Business.

371
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:31,228
You know why they call Australia
"down under," don't you?

372
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,930
Because it's as close
as you can get to hell

373
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,734
without being burned.

374
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,279
How about you leave
the bottle, Slim?

375
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,457
So, what's your handle
back in the States?

376
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,195
I was a...

377
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,665
...chief of surgery.

378
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,826
Was?

379
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,196
Yeah, was.

380
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,607
So we're in hell, huh?

381
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,042
Don't let the air conditioning
fool you, son.

382
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,943
You are here too.

383
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,482
And you are suffering.

384
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,348
But don't beat
yourself up about it.

385
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,981
It's fate.

386
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,492
Some people are just
supposed to suffer.

387
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,192
That's why the Red Sox
will never win the damn Series.

388
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,406
I have a son.
He's about your age.

389
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,476
He's not like me.

390
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,216
He does what's in his heart.

391
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:56,213
He's a good man.

392
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:59,119
Maybe a great one.

393
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,489
And right now,
he thinks that I hate him.

394
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,994
He thinks I feel
betrayed by him.

395
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,336
But what I really feel

396
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,637
is gratitude

397
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,974
and pride

398
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,343
because of what he did to me.

399
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,913
What he did for me.

400
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:30,611
It took more courage than I have.

401
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,023
Hmm. There's a pay phone over here.

402
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,962
I could pick it up,
and I could call my son.

403
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,601
I could tell him about all of this.

404
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,104
I could tell him that I love him.

405
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,732
One simple phone call,
and I could fix everything.

406
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,710
Then why don't you?

407
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,476
Because I am weak.

408
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,919
This, uh...

409
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,019
This business that you have,

410
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,893
will it ease your suffering?

411
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:21,071
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing here?

412
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,839
- It ain't that simple.
- Of course it is.

413
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,743
Unless you want to end up
like me, of course it is.

414
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,790
You're developing quite a talent.

415
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,120
Yeah.

416
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,300
I get it.

417
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,636
You're here
to check up on me.

418
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,669
You killed a man.

419
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,968
A man who killed one of us.

420
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,038
Who kidnapped Claire.
Who strung me up and left me for dead.

421
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,552
He deserved to die.
I'd do it again in a minute.

422
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,587
Pardon me if I'm out
of bad feeling.

423
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,127
When I was in the army
in Tikrit in Iraq,

424
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,097
the man who lived
next door was a policeman.

425
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,191
One day his car
was rigged with a bomb.

426
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,567
It killed his wife
and three young children instead.

427
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,231
They caught
the man who did it.

428
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,966
I volunteered to be
on the firing squad,

429
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,604
and I did my duty without
a single ounce of remorse.

430
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:14,045
Then for no reason,
I found myself waking up at night,

431
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,552
replaying what I did
in my head.

432
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,353
You're the one
who needs checking up on.

433
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,122
What happened with Ethan

434
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,720
will be with you
for the rest of your life.

435
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,540
Any suggestions?

436
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,576
You're not alone.

437
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,941
Don't pretend to be.

438
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,451
I take comfort knowing someday

439
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,725
this is all gonna be
a real nice shopping complex.

440
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,857
Maybe even an auto mall.

441
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,629
Where you going?

442
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,466
Know what that is?

443
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,005
A hole in the mud.

444
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,598
- It's a wallow.
- What the hell's a wallow?

445
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,873
Boar's wallow.
It's his den where he sleeps.

446
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,506
Look at these tree rubbings
from his tusks.

447
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,616
- You mean he's around here?
- Maybe.

448
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,789
Wait... Sawyer!

449
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,560
Gotcha.

450
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,162
- I thought it'd be bigger.
- Funny.

451
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,134
We know daddy's
got to be around here.

452
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,067
- Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!
- Hey.

453
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,833
Put it down!
That's not funny!

454
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,305
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy!

455
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,399
Hey, what is the matter with you?

456
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,943
- You'll hurt it!
- Over here!

457
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,878
- Not funny!
- Here, piggy... Ow!

458
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,006
You're sick.

459
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:54,574
I didn't hurt it.

460
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,882
Find your own way home.

461
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,652
No problem!

462
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,069
Sawyer.

463
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,111
I got a letter for you.

464
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,322
- "Dear Mr. Sawyer..."
- Who?

465
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,233
You used to go
by the name of Sawyer.

466
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,865
What the hell are you
talking about?

467
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,340
You didn't have to.

468
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:57,245
Tell Hibbs I would have paid.

469
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,916
How do you know Hibbs?

470
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,919
You don't...

471
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,047
You don't know
what you're doing, do you?

472
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:10,527
You borrowed money from Hibbs?

473
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,589
I was gonna pay.

474
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,706
It'll come back around.

475
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,034
Kate!

476
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,235
It's just a boar.

477
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,944
Let's get back to camp.

478
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,800
Go get it!
Go, Vincent! Go get it!

479
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,668
Go, boy.

480
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,119
Here we go.

481
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,348
Hey.

482
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,555
Hey.

483
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,288
Want to take that walk now?

484
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:05,901
Sure.

485
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,024
Stick 'em up.

486
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,771
Trying to be funny?

487
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,407
Yeah.

488
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,445
I was fresh out of pies
to throw at you.

489
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,918
Here you go, sheriff.

490
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,848
- I asked you for this two days ago.
- And I told you to stick it.

491
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,925
But I made a deal
with your girlfriend.

492
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,291
What did she give you?

493
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,156
Kate. What did she give you?

494
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,003
Nothing she wasn't willing
to part with.

495
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,437
That's why the Sox
will never win the Series.

496
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,708
- What's that?
- Huh?

497
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,008
What'd you just say?

498
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,546
I said that's why the Red Sox
will never win the Series.

499
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,643
What's that supposed to mean?

500
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,689
It's just something
my father used to say...

501
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,083
...so he could go through life
knowing that people hated him.

502
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,995
Instead of taking responsibility for it,
he just put it on fate.

503
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,792
Said he was made that way.

504
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,299
Your daddy,

505
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,531
he a doctor too?

506
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,566
Was.

507
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,138
He's dead.

508
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,419
Why do you want to know
about my father?

509
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,224
No reason.
