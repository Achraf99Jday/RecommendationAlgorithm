1
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:20,310
Anything?

2
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,446
You keep asking if there's anything.

3
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,615
Pardon me for appearing desperate,

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,421
but before the pilot was ripped
from the cockpit,

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:32,329
he did say that no one's gonna find us
unless we get that transceiver working.

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,632
So... is there anything?

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,398
- No.
- Okay.

8
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,607
What were you doing
in the bathroom?

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,506
Thought you could tell.
I was getting sick.

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,516
Puking. My one tangible
contribution to the trek.

11
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,850
No, I'm glad you came, Charlie.

12
00:00:55,922 --> 00:01:00,018
- Every trek needs a coward.
- You're not a coward.

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,736
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm good, thanks.

14
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,545
- Can I get you a water or...?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

15
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,378
Please?

16
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,387
All right.

17
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:02,178
- Excuse me.
- Guess he really had to go.

18
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,246
Sir? Excuse me!

19
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,349
Sir, excuse me.

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,367
Excuse me.

21
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:35,043
Ladies and gentleman, the captain has
turned on the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

22
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,352
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

23
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,429
Sir?
Are you all right?

24
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,303
Just a minute.

25
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,775
Just a minute.

26
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,184
I'm gonna have to ask
that you open the door.

27
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,623
Open the door now, sir.

28
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,160
Sir?

29
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,587
Hey. We're going through
some clothes. Sorting them.

30
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,129
I see you found your bag.

31
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,397
- Come on, you wanna give us a hand?
- Not really.

32
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,494
You're wasting your time.
They're coming.

33
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,335
Is that your boyfriend?

34
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,378
My brother. Boone.

35
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,716
God's friggin' gift to humanity.

36
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,497
I used to have a stomach.

37
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:09,196
- Do you know what it is?
- Not yet.

38
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,774
I haven't felt the baby move
since yesterday.

39
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,602
Excuse me.

40
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,750
Hey, uh, have you, uh...?
Have you seen my boy?

41
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,173
Sorry.

42
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:29,119
Walt! Walt!

43
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,054
Vincent!

44
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,462
Vincent!

45
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,708
Come here, boy.

46
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,444
Hey!

47
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,146
What did I tell you
after what's happened?

48
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,244
- I thought Vincent would be around.
- Stay on the beach.

49
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,289
I thought this would be okay.

50
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:41,224
Don't do that. You listen to me,
I mean what I say. You understand?

51
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,487
- What is this?
- I just found 'em.

52
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,301
Come here.

53
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,413
- Hey, guys, come on.

54
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,817
Hey.

55
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,654
Hey! Break it up!

56
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,254
- Break it up! Get off!
- Hey, come on, break it...

57
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,823
- You son of a bitch.
- That's it. It's over.

58
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,892
- Come on.
- That's it!

59
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,837
- I'm sick of this redneck!
- Want some more?

60
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,603
Tell everyone what you told me!
Tell them I made the plane crash.

61
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,769
- The shoe fits!
- What is going on?

62
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,010
- What's going on?
- My kid found these in the jungle.

63
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,751
This guy was in the back row
of business class the whole flight.

64
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,551
Never got up.
Hands folded underneath the blanket.

65
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,060
And for some reason,
just pointing this out,

66
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,324
- The guy next to him didn't make it.
- Thank you for observing.

67
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,525
Don't think I saw them pull you
out of line before we boarded?

68
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,091
- Come on! Bring it!
- Stop!

69
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,772
We found the transceiver,
but it's not working.

70
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,572
Can anybody help?

71
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,884
Yes, I might be able to.

72
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,751
Oh, great! Perfect.
Let's trust this guy.

73
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,653
Hey, we're all in this together.

74
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,522
- Treat each other with respect...
- Shut up, lardo.

75
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,357
Hey!

76
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,857
Give it a break.

77
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,360
Whatever you say, doc,
you're the hero.

78
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,367
You guys found the cockpit?

79
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,545
Any survivors?

80
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,286
No.

81
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,186
Dual-band. Military spec.

82
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,159
Chances are the battery is good,
but the radio is dead.

83
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,594
- Can you fix it?
- I need some time.

84
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:04,930
Doctor, that man with the shrapnel,
I think you should take a look at him.

85
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,182
Chain-smoking jackass.

86
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:24,486
- Some people have problems.
- Some people have problems. Us. Him.

87
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,957
You're okay. I like you.

88
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,994
You're okay too.

89
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,261
Hurley. Oh, just...

90
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,866
Sayid.

91
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,617
- How do you know how to do that?
- I was a communications officer.

92
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:57,520
- Oh, yeah? You ever see battle?
- I fought in the Gulf War.

93
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,559
No way. I got a buddy
who fought over there.

94
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:05,620
He was in the 104th Airborne.
What were you, Air Force? Army?

95
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,689
The Republican Guard.

96
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,539
Is it working?

97
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,448
It seems to be, except
we're not picking up a signal.

98
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,247
Why? Aren't we
trying to send one?

99
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,914
Yes, but what you want
to see here is little bars.

100
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,082
The bars show
it's getting reception.

101
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:42,127
- We need the bars?
- We could broadcast blind,

102
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,925
hope that someone, maybe a ship
somewhere picks up our distress call.

103
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,991
But that would be a waste of the
battery, which might not last for long.

104
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,035
- There is one thing we could try.
- What?

105
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,904
- Get the signal from high ground.
- How high?

106
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,603
How is he?

107
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,376
Can you do anything?

108
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:42,986
- I can pull out the shrapnel.
- But you said if you took it out...

109
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:47,389
That was yesterday. I was hoping
he'd be at a hospital by now.

110
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,553
If I leave him like this
he'll be dead within a day.

111
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,529
If I open him up...

112
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,159
If I can control the bleeding,
and if he doesn't go into sepsis,

113
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:00,569
and if I can find some antibiotics,
he might be all right.

114
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,510
I'm going on a hike.

115
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,414
- Sorry?
- Sayid fixed the transceiver,

116
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,749
- But we can't use it, not from here.
- Wait.

117
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,550
You said we had to send a signal.

118
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,115
- You saw what that thing did.
- Yeah, I did.

119
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,822
What makes you think we're any safer
here than we are in the jungle?

120
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,699
- Wait for me. I don't know how long...
- Sayid said the battery won't last.

121
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,333
All right.

122
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,506
If you see or hear anything...
Anything...

123
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,283
Run.

124
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:45,134
- What's up?

125
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,317
- What, that?

126
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,384
What, eat that?

127
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,123
Dude, dude, I'm starving.

128
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,923
But I am nowhere near that hungry.

129
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,397
No. No. No, thank you.

130
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,032
No way. No.

131
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,986
The comic's in Spanish. You...

132
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,695
...read Spanish?
- No. I found it.

133
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,036
Tell you what, we get home...

134
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,282
...l'll get you another dog.

135
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,438
Hey!

136
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,737
- I need your help.
- Okay.

137
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,973
Help me go through the luggage. I need
any prescription medications you find,

138
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,416
especially drugs that end in "mycin"
and "cillin." Those are antibiotics.

139
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,152
What's this for?

140
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,074
What are you doing?

141
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,452
I think I was mean to him.

142
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,216
What?

143
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,316
He's that guy from the gate.

144
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:20,263
He wouldn't let us have our seats
in first class. He saved our lives.

145
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,765
Shannon, we're trying to clear
the wreckage. You should help out.

146
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,209
You're just being worthless over here.

147
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,405
- Being what?
- What do you want me to say?

148
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:39,611
- You're sitting staring at bodies.
- I've just been through a trauma.

149
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,416
We all have. The difference
is you've given yourself a pedicure.

150
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:44,478
You know what?

151
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,787
- It is easy to make fun of me...
- I wish I didn't waste my time.

152
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,987
I wish I didn't have a reason!
It is easy.

153
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:54,590
Screw you. You do not have
the slightest idea what I am thinking.

154
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,693
- No, you don't!
- Okay, Shannon, what are you thinking?

155
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,506
I'm going with them.
On the hike.

156
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,642
- Oh, yeah?
- Yup. I'm going.

157
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:18,520
- No you're not, Shannon. Shannon!
- I'd like to come with you.

158
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,991
- She's not going.
- The hell I'm not!

159
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,118
- This is what she does.
- You don't know!

160
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,595
Makes bad decisions
to upset her family, me.

161
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,124
Shut up and stop trying to be charming.
I'm coming with you.

162
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:35,139
- I don't know if that's a good idea.
- What are you, two years older than me?

163
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,233
- You're going, aren't you?
- Yeah. Are you?

164
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,006
- Yup.
- Yeah, I'm definitely going.

165
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,412
Look, everybody can come.
But we're leaving now.

166
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,718
You couldn't tell from that,
but she's really nice.

167
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,761
You decided to join us.

168
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,995
I'm a complex guy, sweetheart.

169
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,402
What are you looking for?

170
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,669
Some sort of blade.

171
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,599
How's your son?

172
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,610
Walt?

173
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,044
Yeah, I think he'll be all right.

174
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,418
- How old is he?
- Nine. Ten.

175
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,612
Ten.

176
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,191
Walt's more worried
about his dog than anything.

177
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,524
The dog was on the plane, so...

178
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,831
- Kids, you know.
- Is it a lab?

179
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,430
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

180
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,438
- I saw him yesterday. In the jungle.
- What? Where?

181
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,667
Over there...

182
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,973
...a couple hundred yards in or so.
He looked good.

183
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,297
What is it, like checkers?

184
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,839
Not really.
It's a better game than checkers.

185
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,444
Do you play checkers with your pop?

186
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,080
No.

187
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,524
I live in Australia with my mom.

188
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,755
You have no accent.

189
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,127
Yeah, I know, we move a lot.

190
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,458
She got sick.
She died a couple of weeks ago.

191
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,800
- You're having a bad month.
- I guess.

192
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,922
Backgammon is the
oldest game in the world.

193
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,523
Archaeologists found sets
when they excavated the ruins

194
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:53,360
of ancient Mesopotamia.
Five thousand years old.

195
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,299
That's older than Jesus Christ.

196
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,461
Did they have dice and stuff?

197
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,435
But theirs weren't made of plastic.
Their dice were made of bones.

198
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,306
Cool.

199
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,912
Two players. Two sides.

200
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,846
One is light. One is dark.

201
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,954
Walt...

202
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,430
...do you wanna know a secret?

203
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,140
No, thank you.
No, that's fine.

204
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,978
No.

205
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,219
Okay. Thanks.

206
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,438
- Mmm.

207
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,975
Oh, God.

208
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,241
I just felt it!

209
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,718
I just... Come here, feel this!

210
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,980
Feel this. Please.

211
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,691
Do you feel that?
That, right there.

212
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,320
That's a kick!

213
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,291
There, right there's a foot!

214
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,836
Oh, my God, wait,
he's moving around.

215
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,162
He. He.

216
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,541
I guess I think you're a he.

217
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,918
Okay. Wide open space.
Check the radio, see if we're good.

218
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,721
- We're not gonna have reception.
- Just try it.

219
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,321
- I don't want to waste batteries.
- I'm not asking to keep it on.

220
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,424
- We're blocked by the mountain.
- Check the damn radio!

221
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,061
We might not have any juice left
when we get to...

222
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,611
Oh, my God.

223
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,612
- What the hell's that?
- Something's coming.

224
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,615
Coming towards us.

225
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:37,126
- Come on, let's move.
- I shouldn't have come on this hike!

226
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,564
- Go, go!
- Sawyer!

227
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,296
- Let him go!

228
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,121
That's...

229
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,260
That's a big bear.

230
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,503
You think that's what killed the pilot?

231
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:24,838
No. No, that's a tiny,
teeny version compared to that.

232
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,744
- Guys, this isn't just a bear.

233
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,077
It's a polar bear.

234
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,450
You sure he's out?

235
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,155
He's out.

236
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,228
How do you know he won't wake up
when you yank that thing out?

237
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,063
I don't.

238
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,641
Hey, guy, you awake?

239
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,112
Yo! There's a rescue plane!
We're saved! Yay!

240
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,072
Yeah, he's out.

241
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,815
So, what do you want me...?

242
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,186
It's unlikely
he'll regain consciousness,

243
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,385
but the pain might bring him around.
If it does, hold him down.

244
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:24,564
Uh... I'm not so good
around blood, man.

245
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,827
Then don't look.

246
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:29,430
Yeah. But...

247
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,873
I'm not so good around blood.

248
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,241
Just do the best you can, okay?

249
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,014
- Don't look.
- Okay.

250
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,430
Dude.

251
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,540
- Hand me those strips.
- Dude.

252
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:08,067
- I need to get this bleeding stopped.
- I don't think I can.

253
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,842
- What? What's going on?
- Just hand me the strips.

254
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,110
Give it to me.
Don't even think about it.

255
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,744
Don't even think it. Hurley, hey!

256
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,117
Damn it.

257
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,715
- That can't be a polar bear.
- It's a polar bear.

258
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,090
Wait a minute.

259
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,597
- Polar bears don't live in the jungle.
- Spot-on.

260
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,724
- Polar bears don't live this far south.
- This one does.

261
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:32,167
Did. It did.

262
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,728
Where did that come from?

263
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,530
Probably Bear Village.
How the hell do I know?

264
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,203
Not the bear, the gun.

265
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,477
- I got it off one of the bodies.
- One of the bodies?

266
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,609
- One of the bodies.
- People don't carry guns on planes.

267
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,916
They do if they're a U.S. marshal.
There was one on the plane.

268
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,547
How do you know that?

269
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,923
I saw a guy lying there with
an ankle holster, so I took the gun,

270
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:56,795
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, I just shot a bear.

271
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,424
thought it might come in handy.
Guess what, I just shot a bear.

272
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,594
- So why do you think he's a marshal?
- Because he had a clip-on badge!

273
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,105
- I took that too. Thought it was cool.
- I know who you are.

274
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,965
- You're the prisoner.
- I'm the what?

275
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,976
You found a gun on a U.S. marshal?

276
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:17,242
You knew where it was because he
was bringing you back to the States.

277
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,749
The handcuffs were on you.
That's how you knew.

278
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,513
- Piss off!
- That's who you are.

279
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,816
Be as suspicious of me
as I am of you.

280
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,322
- You are the prisoner.
- Fine, I'm the criminal.

281
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,655
You're the terrorist.
We'll all play a part!

282
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,853
Who do you wanna be?

283
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,459
- Does anybody know how to use a gun?
- I think you just pull the trigger.

284
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,733
- Don't use the gun.
- I want to take it apart.

285
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:47,504
There's a button on the grip.
Push that, it will eject the magazine.

286
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,812
There's still a round in the chamber.

287
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,476
Hold the grip,
pull the top part of the gun.

288
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:11,792
- I know your type.
- I'm not so sure.

289
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,362
Yeah, I've been with girls like you.

290
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,208
Not girls exactly like me.

291
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,489
Can I get you a refill?

292
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,865
- I'm fine with this, thank you.

293
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:49,066
You, sir, can I get you anything?
Cocktail, soda?

294
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,335
Just coffee, sweetheart. Black.

295
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,775
Coffee, sure.

296
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,304
You look worried.

297
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,650
I'd be worried too, I was you.

298
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,017
But you gotta stay positive, kiddo.

299
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,888
There's always that off-chance
that they'll believe your story.

300
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,586
I know I sure do.

301
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,589
- I don't care what you believe.
- Oh, I know that's true.

302
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,362
That has always been true.

303
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,469
You sure you don't
want some more juice?

304
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,871
Yeah, I'm sure.

305
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,892
<i>Ladies and gentleman, </i>

306
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,802
<i>the captain has switched on
the "fasten seatbelts" sign. </i>

307
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,669
<i>Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts. </i>

308
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,113
I have one favor to ask.

309
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,242
Really? This oughta be good.

310
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,366
We should keep moving.

311
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,703
No.

312
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,382
Where is she?

313
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,922
Who?

314
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:19,310
Oh, now's a good time to check
the radio. Not before, but now.

315
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,318
- We're up higher.
- Yes, we are.

316
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,053
Bar.

317
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,997
Hey, we've got a bar!

318
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,968
- Mayday, Mayday!

319
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,004
- What is that?
- Feedback.

320
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,542
- From what? What would do that?
- I don't know.

321
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,876
I'll tell you what. This guy not fixing
the radio. The thing doesn't even work.

322
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,808
No. No, no, no, no, it's not broken.

323
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,083
We can't transmit because
something else is already transmitting.

324
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,853
- From where?
- What?

325
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,087
Close, the signal's strong.

326
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,858
Somewhere close?
On the island? That's great!

327
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,764
- Maybe it's other survivors.
- From our plane? How...?

328
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,803
- What kind of transmission?
- Satphone, radio signal.

329
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,566
- Can we listen?
- Let me get the frequency. Hold on.

330
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,631
- There's no transmission.
- Shut up!

331
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:22,270
- The rescue party, it has to be.

332
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:26,840
French. The French are coming! I've
never been so happy to hear the French.

333
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,045
I never took French.
What is she saying?

334
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,611
- Does anyone speak French?
- She does.

335
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,213
No, I don't. What?

336
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,350
What? You spent a year in Paris!

337
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:36,893
Drinking! Not studying!

338
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,796
<i>Iteration 7-2-9-4-5-3-1.</i>

339
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,391
- Okay, what's that?
- Oh, no, no, no.

340
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,561
- What?
- Batteries are dying.

341
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,798
- How much time do we have?
- Not much.

342
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,899
- I've heard you speak French. Listen.
- I can't!

343
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,536
Do you speak French,
because that would be nice.

344
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:59,572
<i>- Iteration 1-7-2... 
- That voice is weird. What is that?</i>

345
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,675
Come on, come on.

346
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:05,745
- It's... It's repeating.

347
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,017
- She's right.
- What?

348
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:12,927
It's a loop. "lteration."
It's repeating the same message.

349
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,898
<i>- It's a counter.
- Iteration... </i>

350
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:21,337
<i>- The next number will end 5-3-3.
- ... 9-4-5-3-3.</i>

351
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,669
Does anyone know
what he's talking about?

352
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,905
It's a running count of the number
of times the message has repeated.

353
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:32,746
It's roughly 30 seconds long, so...
How long...?

354
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:37,254
<i>- Don't forget to carry the one.
- ... 5-3-4.</i>

355
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,485
- She's saying..."Please."

356
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:46,292
She's saying, "Please, help me.
Please, come get me."

357
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,525
Or she's not!
You don't even speak French!

358
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,567
- Let her!
- Shut up!

359
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,899
Guys, the battery.
The battery.

360
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,532
<i>... 7-2-9-4-5-3-5.</i>

361
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,704
- I'm alone now.

362
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,476
I'm... on the island alone.

363
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:11,317
- Please, someone come.

364
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,590
The others, they're...
They're dead.

365
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,729
It killed them.

366
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,097
It killed them all."

367
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,106
- That was good.
- Sixteen years.

368
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,708
What?

369
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:45,586
Sixteen years... and five months.
That's the count.

370
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,682
- What the hell are you talking about?
- The iterations.

371
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,625
It's a distress call.

372
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,623
A plea for help. A Mayday.

373
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,765
If the counter's right...

374
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,767
...it's been playing over and over...

375
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,307
...for 16 years.

376
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,838
Someone else was stranded here?

377
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,807
Maybe they came for them.

378
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,409
If someone came,
why is it still playing?

379
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,662
Guys...

380
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,361
...where are we?
