1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,094
<i> Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,663
Right now, this is our priority.

3
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,539
Oh!

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,946
How did you come to be
on this island, Danielle?

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,350
The ship slammed into rocks,
ran aground.

6
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,203
Hold on a second, dude.
You want what now?

7
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,341
- You wanna make snowballs?
- Hold the bamboo tighter.

8
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,674
I think.

9
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,551
- Hey.
- Hey.

10
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,883
- How's it coming?
- It's coming.

11
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,582
Long as nobody sabotages
this one as well, huh?

12
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,818
<i>I got people standing guard 24l7.</i>

13
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,021
Nobody gets near this,
with or without intent to burn.

14
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,758
I was thinking, uh,
the chances of a passing ship

15
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,130
spotting this raft out there
is pretty slim.

16
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,533
We could use something
to send a distress call

17
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:13,231
to any ship that might be close.
Like an SOS.

18
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,935
OK. I'll ask Sayid, but even if he
could make something like that,

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,342
he's not gonna have anything
to power it with.

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,279
Didn't Sayid say that crazy
French chick had batteries?

21
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:27,415
- Absolutely not.
- I'm not asking you to go.

22
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,011
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

23
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,216
- We're trying...
- Do you think she would

24
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,521
give up something she needs
to a stranger?

25
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,188
All I'm asking is for you
to tell me how to find her. That's it.

26
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,629
I was brought unconscious
to her camp.

27
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,634
I was disoriented.
I don't know how to find her.

28
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,727
Don't know, dude?
Or don't want to?

29
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,435
Sayid, look. You've got
her maps and her papers.

30
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,976
You thought they were
pointing to something.

31
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,604
- I was wrong.
- Maybe they're pointing to her.

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,739
Look! I don't know what
these papers mean!

33
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,443
They could be the ravings
of her disturbed mind.

34
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,850
Song lyrics, mixed with equations!

35
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,959
If this map is pointing to her,

36
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,996
then you should know
she resides here in this area.

37
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,363
<i>She gave it a name.
"Territoire Fonce. "</i>

38
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,765
Shannon translated it.

39
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:20,636
It means "Dark Territory." That sound
like a place you'd like to visit?

40
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,801
- So you won't help?
- I didn't say that.

41
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,904
I'll build the distress beacon.
I suggest you find another power source.

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,644
- Something in the cockpit.
- We're not going to the cockpit.

43
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,447
<i>* Swing your partner, dosey do</i>

44
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,289
<i>- Step high! 
- What are you doing in there?</i>

45
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,990
<i>- ... when you cut the... 
- I'm just checking something out.</i>

46
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,556
<i>I hope you're not watching those
G-string mujeres again.</i>

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,262
Look, Ma, we talked about this.

48
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,567
If you want me living here,
you gotta respect my privacy.

49
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,706
And no, I'm not.

50
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,671
Look at you.
It's Saturday night.

51
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,707
A grown-up man
sitting at home watching TV.

52
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,152
You should go out.
Try to find yourself a nice woman.

53
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,587
I'll get right on that.

54
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,455
Try eating better.
You're gaining weight again.

55
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,222
<i>... with the Mega Number 42.</i>

60

61
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,514
<i>That's right, Mary Jo, </i>

62
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,519
<i>because this is the
sixteenth week without a winner. </i>

63
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,109
Hi.

64
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,580
You awake?

65
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,955
I was just wondering that myself.

66
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,721
That French lady wrote this stuff?

67
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,094
It's the middle of the night.
What do you want?

68
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,136
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

69
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,968
And I got curious.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,769
You and Shannon,

71
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,005
you guys have been trying
to figure out some of this stuff,

72
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,047
and I was wondering what...

73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,516
...you guys figured out
about this stuff?

74
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,413
- What stuff?
- I don't know.

75
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,356
Well, take these numbers
she wrote down a bunch of times.

76
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,858
Got any idea what it means?

77
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,029
I thought at one time they might be
coordinates of some kind.

78
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,160
Coordinates, yeah.

79
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,802
But when you first found her,
the French chick,

80
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,867
you said you saw a wire
or something on the beach.

81
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,844
You followed it,
and it led you to her.

82
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,110
No. It led me into a trap she set.

83
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,208
But her place is
probably close, right?

84
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,118
- Why are you interested in Rousseau?
- I'm not.

85
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,522
Just making conversation, dude.

86
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,787
Sorry if it's a bad time.

87
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,461
Good night.

88
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,234
Yeah, you.

89
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,279
How did you come up
with the winning numbers?

90
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:52,444
Oh, uh, they just,
uh, sorta came to me.

91
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,579
- Why don't you introduce your family?
- Oh, yeah, okay. Um...

92
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,422
This bashful beauty is my mom, Carmen.
Come here, Ma.

93
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,461
And this is my brother, Diego,
and his wife, Lisa.

94
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,589
- Whoo! We're rich!
- Nice, dude.

95
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,758
Ignore him. He's an idiot. And, uh...

96
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,133
Oh! You gotta meet this guy.
This is the greatest guy I know.

97
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,905
My grandpa, Tito.
He's worked three jobs for...

98
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,275
<i>- How long's it been, Abuelito? 
- 52 years.</i>

99
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,540
Fifty-two years!

100
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:25,175
He's 70 years old, and the closest thing
that he's had to a vacation

101
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,243
is when they put a pacemaker
in him four years ago.

102
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,690
The first thing I'll do with the money
is to give him the rest he's earned.

103
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,659
That's what it's all about for me,

104
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,527
to be able to do things
for the people I care about.

105
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,533
'Cause I really put my family
through a lot recently,

106
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,695
and, um, well, this way
I can make it up to them.

107
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,638
You know, maybe even
buy my mom a new house.

108
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,436
And, uh...

109
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,774
Maybe after, uh, my grandpa
comes back from his cruise,

110
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:57,544
we can get to do some of the things
that we always wanted to do.

111
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,809
Grandpa?

112
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,121
- Hey.
- I'm not doing anything.

113
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,594
What?

114
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,099
- What?
- Just saying good morning.

115
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,694
Oh. Right.

116
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,895
Morning.

117
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,771
- Sorry.
- You going somewhere?

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,137
Me? No.

119
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,344
Well, yeah...

120
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,678
...just thought
I might take a walk.

121
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,776
Uh, maybe scope out
some, uh, new fishing area.

122
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,548
- I'll come with.
- That's okay.

123
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,282
I could use a bit of the wide open.

124
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,416
Dude, I could really use
some alone time right now.

125
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,920
Sure.

126
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,999
I'm a big guy.
I get dehydrated easy.

127
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,270
Yeah.

128
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,770
Yeah, okay.

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,147
Claire, you got a second?

130
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,949
- Uh, sure.
- I was wondering if you're free

131
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,789
to help me with a little project.

132
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,625
- Me?
- Yeah.

133
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,791
I'm building something and I could
use an extra pair of hands.

134
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,263
I'm nine months pregnant.
I can barely waddle to the beach.

135
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,565
Could you hold a saw?

136
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,300
- Um, yeah.
- Can you move your hand back and forth?

137
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,505
- Possibly.
- You're perfect.

138
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,477
Come on.

139
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,451
Okay.

140
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,493
So, what exactly are we building?

141
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,758
Where is it?

142
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,797
- Where's what?
- The map. It won't help you find her.

143
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,568
- I don't have it.
- What's worse

144
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,577
is you won't do your own dirty work.
You get Hurley to do it.

145
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,579
Wait a minute. Hurley?

146
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,548
He was in my tent last night.
Quizzing me about Rousseau.

147
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,710
About numbers she wrote,
how I came to find her.

148
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,186
You don't know anything
about this, do you?

149
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,360
- Charlie, have you seen Hurley?
- Um...

150
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,228
Couple of hours ago.
He was setting out for a walk.

151
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,892
Acting like a loon, I might add.

152
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,570
My God. He's going after her.

153
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,138
- When are you gonna be back?
- If we catch him, before nightfall.

154
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,507
Why?

155
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,309
Are you worried about me?

156
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,940
So what if I am?

157
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,244
Sayid!

158
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,583
You ready?

159
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,387
I'll be fine.

160
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,274
Hugo, turn that noise down.

161
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,980
Oh, sorry.

162
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,785
Where are you taking me?
You know I don't like surprises.

163
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,953
You're gonna like this one, Ma.

164
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,725
I mean, after everything
you've been through...

165
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,231
...like Grandpa...

166
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,703
Then at the funeral, Father Aguilar
getting struck by lightning.

167
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,502
Man, that was a freak storm.

168
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,940
And Diego moving back home

169
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:51,677
- After Lisa left him for that waitress.
- Don't mention that whore.

170
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,549
I'm just saying, you deserve
something good to happen.

171
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,090
You know,

172
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,595
ever since I won
the lottery, it's like...

173
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,657
...we've had nothing but bad luck.

174
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,502
Like, I don't know,

175
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,265
the money's cursed or something.

176
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,499
Ow!

177
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,337
That's blasphemy.
You know we are Catholic.

178
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,971
- We don't believe in curses.
- Jeez, Ma, I'm just talking.

179
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,976
Okay, we're almost there.
Here, put this on.

180
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,128
- Why do I have to wear this?
- Give me your hand. Careful.

181
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,933
- You be careful.
- Stepping down.

182
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,974
I can't see anything.

183
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,506
Okay, now,
take off your blindfold,

184
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,639
and get a look at
your new dream house.

185
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,513
My ankle. Ahhh!

186
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,145
I said take off your blindfold.

187
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,688
Why did you make me
put that thing on?

188
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,783
Hugo, do I smell smoke?

189
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,890
Aw, crap!

190
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,454
Hang on. I gotta call 911.

191
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,966
You tell them I broke my ankle.

192
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,474
Drop the phone.
Move away from the vehicle.

193
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,605
- No, no! It's the house.
- Do it! Now!

194
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,047
Turn around.

195
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,122
No such thing as curses, Ma?

196
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,021
You have the right to remain silent.

197
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,425
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

198
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,678
Yo! French chick!

199
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,751
I would think you'd be happy.

200
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,486
Every one of your stocks is up.

201
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,495
Your interests in orange futures
skyrocketed

202
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,997
after those tropical storms hit Florida.

203
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,466
And you are now the
majority shareholder

204
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:27,063
for a box company in Tustin.

205
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,733
- A box company?
- Mm-hmm. They make boxes.

206
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,903
Lucrative business.
Everybody needs boxes.

207
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,345
Which reminds me,
your sneaker factory in Canada...

208
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,851
- I own a sneaker factory in Canada?
- Well, not anymore.

209
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,413
- It was destroyed in a fire last month.
- Of course it was.

210
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,926
You might have read about it.
Eight-something people died.

211
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,484
But the good news is,
we over-insured it.

212
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,463
It's gonna yield you a windfall.

213
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,228
And when we add in the generous
settlement from the LAPD

214
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,669
for your false arrest,
you've almost doubled your net worth

215
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,932
in a few short months.

216
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,533
I still can't imagine how the police
mistook you for a drug dealer.

217
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,111
- Bad luck.
- Hugo.

218
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,977
You are not the first
lottery winner to believe

219
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,143
the money's brought nothing
but trouble. It's in your head.

220
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,779
You don't believe in jinxes?
You know, curses?

221
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,982
I'm an accountant.
I believe in numbers.

222
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,548
- Where'd you get 'em, anyway?
- What?

223
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,356
The numbers. What did you use?
Somebody's birthday?

224
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,422
- Phone number?
- It's nothing. It's just something...

225
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

226
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,205
That's it.

227
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,641
It's not the money,
it's the numbers.

228
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,939
The numbers are cursed.

229
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,373
Dude, don't look at me like that.
I'm not crazy.

230
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,883
- This is really...
- Listen to yourself.

231
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,148
"The numbers are cursed."
You know there is no such thing as...

232
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,799
You wanna hit that a little harder?

233
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,273
I'm sorry. Is my building a raft
to get us rescued bothering you?

234
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,244
- At the moment, yeah.
- Why aren't you helping?

235
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,406
I am helping, short-round.

236
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,143
Keeping watch for arsonists.

237
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,976
Walt's got a point.

238
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,489
You could pitch in,
as you've already bought your ticket.

239
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,425
Did you tie this like I told you?
If you'd tied it like I told you,

240
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,762
the thing would still be together.

241
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,496
What's the matter with you?
What is your problem?

242
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,001
He's never going to
speak to me again.

243
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,938
He just needs time.

244
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,947
I humiliated him.

245
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,559
When the raft sails,

246
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,187
do you think he's going
to leave with them?

247
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,698
I don't know.

248
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,638
Don't move!

249
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,368
- Hey, what are you guys...?
- Do not move.

250
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,310
You're on a pressure trigger.

251
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,509
If you take your weight off it,
it will release that.

252
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,517
Oh, man.

253
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:09,288
We need to replace
his weight on the trigger.

254
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,159
- How we gonna do that?
- Don't move.

255
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,222
Hey, everybody just calm down.

256
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,665
- Can I drop the wire?
- Maybe I'll find a rock.

257
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,566
- I'm dropping the wire.
- No!

258
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,604
- I can make it.
- Hurley, don't move.

259
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,667
I can get out of the way.
I'm spry.

260
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,542
- Stay put.
- No, wait!

261
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,172
Hurley, don't even...

262
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:38,716
Hurley, what the bloody hell's
wrong with you?

263
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,918
Nothing.

264
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,862
What are you doing out here?

265
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,929
I came to get a battery.

266
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:50,831
Seriously, what's going on?

267
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,427
Nada.

268
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,572
You guys coming?

269
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:01,912
You all want to go? Fine.

270
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,177
But perhaps I should take the lead.

271
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,309
Excellent notion.

272
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,724
Lenny. His name is Lenny.

273
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,695
- Or Leonard.
- But you don't know his last name.

274
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,392
Look, I just need to talk to him
for five minutes.

275
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,492
If you can't tell me
the person's name,

276
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,663
- I can't look it up.
- How many Leonards are here?

277
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,603
Can't you just type in "Leonard"?

278
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,575
The guy's been here forever.
He knows me.

279
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,305
Our records are private,
And any visitors...

280
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,870
Dude, do not
do that right now!

281
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,146
Leave the bulb
for another time, man.

282
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,158
Five minutes.

283
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,922
All I need is five minutes.

284
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,792
Hugo?

285
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,662
- Oh, hey, doc.
- It's good to see you!

286
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,257
What are you doing back here?

287
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,661
Uh...

288
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,170
I don't remember you
and Leonard being that close, Hugo.

289
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,307
Yeah. Well, we hung.

290
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,344
I'll leave you gentlemen to it.

291
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,940
Good luck, Hugo.

292
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,291
Hey, Lenny.

293
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,726
Remember me?

294
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,788
Hugo.

295
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,157
Hurley.

296
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,463
Well, I was...

297
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,634
...just, you know,
in the neighborhood and, um...

298
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,983
Look, Lenny, I gotta know,
what do the numbers mean?

299
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,180
4-8-15-16-23-42.

300
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,461
Come on, Lenny,
give me something.

301
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,261
Anything.
Where'd you get the numbers?

302
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,531
Is that why you're here?

303
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,198
It's 'cause of the numbers?

304
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,174
Did they do something to you?

305
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,504
'Cause I think
they did something to me.

306
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,439
I think they turned me into a jinx.

307
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,849
Bad news to everyone around me.

308
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,081
And when I tell people
I think I'm the cause,

309
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,384
they look at me like I'm nuts.

310
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,224
They don't believe me.
But, I know.

311
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,026
Ever since I won the lottery
with those numbers...

312
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,534
You used those numbers
to play the lottery?

313
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,903
Uh...

314
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,613
- Yeah.
- You shouldn't have done that.

315
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,612
- You've opened the box.
- I what?

316
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,654
- You shouldn't have used those!
- Why?

317
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,589
It doesn't stop!
You gotta get away from those numbers.

318
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,627
- You gotta get far away.
- All right. Slow down.

319
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,093
Don't you understand?

320
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,630
You gotta get away from them
or it won't stop.

321
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,689
- Calm down.
- Wait. I need answers.

322
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,530
- Step away.
- The numbers!

323
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,196
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Sam Toomey. He heard them.

324
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,240
He heard them in Kalgoorlie.

325
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,537
- What's Kalgoorlie?
- It's a town.

326
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,306
- A town where?
- In Australia.

327
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,177
Oh, God.

328
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,411
It stops here.

329
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,420
It goes into the ground.

330
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,152
This poses somewhat of a problem.

331
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,490
Guys, you should come see this.

332
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:47,837
Whoa.

333
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:00,441
- You never mentioned a bridge.
- I never saw this before.

334
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,053
- No way she built this.
- No, but her team could have.

335
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,886
Or Ethan's team.

336
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,497
- What are you doing?
- Relax, I'm just gonna check it out.

337
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,691
- You guys stay here.
- Get back here!

338
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,961
Dudes, chill.

339
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,501
- Charlie...
- Hey!

340
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,569
Hey! If he can do it...

341
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,611
Charlie!

342
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,239
Charlie!

343
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,481
Dude, you okay?

344
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,893
I'm okay. Whoo!

345
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,394
You two stay right there.

346
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,023
We'll find a way around,
and we'll meet you there.

347
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,329
Nah! Screw that!
You guys stay!

348
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,028
There's a path right here.

349
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:01,163
Will you shut up and listen to Jack.
He said stay put.

350
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,400
You're acting like a bloody lunatic.

351
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,756
If this weren't the middle of nowhere,
I'd say you were lost.

352
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:25,228
- Hi. Is this Sam Toomey's house?
- It is. I'm his wife.

353
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,060
Well, is he around?

354
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,794
'Cause I'd kinda like to talk to him.

355
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,665
I'd like that too,

356
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,432
but Sam's been dead for four years.

357
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,637
Your husband worked
with a guy I know, Leonard Simms.

358
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:44,170
That's right.
They served together in the U.S. Navy.

359
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,944
How is Leonard?

360
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,746
Still in the service?

361
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,320
Uh, he's, um... retired.

362
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,859
Anyway, he told me about Sam...

363
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,362
...hearing something.

364
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,858
- You're talking about the numbers.
- Yes.

365
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,801
The numbers. Exactly.

366
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,238
Do you know anything about them?

367
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,270
Sam and Leonard were stationed
at a listening post

368
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,873
monitoring long-wave transmissions
out of the Pacific.

369
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:20,383
Boring job. Sam hated it.

370
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,450
Nothing to do but listen to static,
night after night.

371
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:29,324
Until one night,
about 16 years ago,

372
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,157
there's something in the static.

373
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,657
A voice comes through,

374
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,224
a voice repeating those numbers

375
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:38,735
over and over again.

376
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:46,509
Couple of days later,
we're at the fair in Kalgoorlie,

377
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:50,605
and some wally there's got this jar,
must have been big as a pony.

378
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,584
It's filled to the rim with beans.
Fella's offering 50 grand to anyone

379
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,919
able to guess how many beans
were in that jar within ten.

380
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:02,088
- Sam used the numbers.
- Yep.

381
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,527
The answer was exact to the bean.

382
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,825
Man had been running
the same scam for 40 years,

383
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,062
nobody had ever come close.

384
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,104
So we won the money.

385
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:19,940
On the way home, a pickup truck
blows a tire on the highway,

386
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,808
hits us head-on.

387
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,079
Lost my leg that night.

388
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,783
- What about Sam?
- Barely a scratch.

389
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,789
Most people would consider
themselves lucky,

390
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,883
but not him.

391
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,123
He was never the same after that.

392
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,497
He started keeping a record.

393
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,800
Anything terrible that happened
to anyone around us,

394
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:50,966
he believed it was all
because he used those numbers.

395
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:54,910
He moved us out here in the middle
of nowhere, hoping it would stop.

396
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,004
Did it?

397
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,613
Did he ever find a way
to make it stop?

398
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,279
Yep.

399
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,184
He put a shotgun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.

400
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,162
What is it you're
looking for, Mr. Reyes?

401
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,360
I used them.

402
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,768
The numbers.

403
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,376
To win the lottery.

404
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,846
And now I think
I'm under the same curse.

405
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,318
Curse? There's no curse.

406
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,118
- You just told me...
- You think I'd still have my leg

407
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,886
if Sam hadn't have picked
the right number of beans?

408
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,621
Floods wouldn't have happened?

409
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:46,687
Homes wouldn't have burned?
People wouldn't have died?

410
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,028
Well... yeah.

411
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,468
You make your own luck,
Mr. Reyes.

412
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:59,874
Don't blame it
on the damn numbers.

413
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:04,142
You're looking for an excuse
that doesn't exist.

414
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,249
It's a trap, right?

415
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,881
For catching animals?

416
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,055
Pass me that cup, please.

417
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,831
- Ugh! What's this gunk?
- Glue.

418
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,561
Where'd you find glue?

419
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:27,071
I made it out of
rendered animal fat.

420
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,501
You made glue?

421
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,505
Wow.

422
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:38,379
You should have one of those shows
where you fix up houses for people.

423
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,214
I don't think so.

424
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,491
Thanks for this.

425
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,859
Giving me something to do.

426
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:58,666
I'm tired of trying to remember
what happened to me out there.

427
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,171
How's that coming...

428
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,335
...your memory?

429
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,936
Bits and pieces.
Here and there.

430
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,382
Nothing that makes any real sense.

431
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,614
Well, maybe I can help.

432
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:21,451
I'm good at putting
bits and pieces together.

433
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,116
What?

434
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,414
This is familiar. This area.

435
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,278
We're close.

436
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,015
How do you know?

437
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,660
I thought she lived underground.

438
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,957
Jack!

439
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,828
What the hell was that?

440
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,482
Hell of a security system.

441
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,519
Somebody trips a wire,
and the whole place blows up.

442
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,077
- There's nothing here.
- The batteries?

443
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,055
Nothing.

444
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:28,784
I don't get it.

445
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,895
She knew.

446
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:37,858
She knew that one day
I'd come back and bring others.

447
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,969
So she abandoned this place,

448
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,872
booby-trapped it
and moved on.

449
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,576
Moved on where?

450
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,875
Jack! Sayid!

451
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,017
Do we know where we're going?

452
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,382
The blast sounded
like it came this way.

453
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,819
- I think.
- You don't know.

454
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,982
Dude, what do you want from me?

455
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,516
What do I want? To know what
we're doing in the middle of nowhere.

456
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,189
And don't tell me
it's because of some batteries.

457
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,528
One minute you're
"good-time Hurley."

458
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,192
The next you're Colonel Kurtz.

459
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,998
It just doesn't make any sense.
It's not you.

460
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,470
Dude, you don't know me.

461
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,565
All this time, you've told me
nothing about yourself.

462
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,543
- We all got personal stuff.
- Don't change the subject.

463
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,102
We're lost out here.

464
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,239
Jack and Sayid could be hurt,

465
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,113
all because you're acting
like some bloody nutter.

466
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,451
I am not crazy!

467
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,923
- I've got my reasons for every...
- I think I have a right to know.

468
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,589
Okay.

469
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,101
- All right, you wanna know?
- Yeah.

470
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,269
About a year ago...

471
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,946
Is someone shooting at us?

472
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,395
Oh!

473
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,362
- You must be the French chick.
- Who are you?

474
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,169
Hurley. L, uh...

475
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:31,373
Sayid, that guy you tortured...

476
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,340
You were on the plane.

477
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,847
Look, I came here to find... Easy.

478
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,994
I'm just getting your notes.

479
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,164
Please, tell me
why you wrote this.

480
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,366
What do these numbers mean?
Please.

481
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,543
I don't know.

482
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,103
What?

483
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,209
You don't know?

484
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,386
Okay, that thing in the woods...

485
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,558
...maybe it's a monster,

486
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,530
maybe it's a pissed-off giraffe.

487
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,863
I don't know.

488
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:28,201
The fact that no one
is even looking for us,

489
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:30,763
yeah, that's weird.

490
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,810
But I just go along with it.

491
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,868
'Cause I'm along for the ride.

492
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,347
Good old fun-time Hurley!

493
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,884
Well, guess what?

494
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,888
Now I want some freaking answers!

495
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:03,639
Our ship picked up a transmission,

496
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,040
a voice, repeating those numbers.

497
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,174
We changed course to investigate.

498
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,715
After we shipwrecked,

499
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,878
my team continued to search
for the transmission source.

500
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,314
It was weeks before
we found the radio tower.

501
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,381
There's a radio tower on this island?

502
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,724
Yes, up by the black rock.

503
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:31,499
Some of us continued to search
for the meaning of those numbers

504
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,969
while we waited for rescue.

505
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,540
But then the sickness came.

506
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:41,601
When my team was gone,

507
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,080
I went back, up to the tower

508
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,810
and changed the transmission.

509
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,386
- That distress signal we heard.
- Yes.

510
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,117
But the numbers...

511
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,628
Did you ever find out
anything about them?

512
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,096
Do you know where
they got their power?

513
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,223
Power?

514
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,864
They bring bad stuff
to everyone around you.

515
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,639
They're cursed,
you know that, right?

516
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,341
The numbers are cursed.

517
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,706
The numbers are
what brought me here.

518
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:25,084
As it appears,
they've brought you.

519
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,390
Since that time,

520
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,759
I've lost everything,

521
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,798
everyone I cared about.

522
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:37,767
So, yes...

523
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,136
...I suppose you're right.

524
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,333
They are cursed.

525
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,905
Thank you.

526
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,481
Thank you.

527
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,286
You have no idea
how long I've been waiting

528
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,418
for somebody
to agree with me.

529
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,196
Thank you!
Oh, God, thank you.

530
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,799
We need to find
Hurley and Charlie,

531
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,503
get out of this jungle.

532
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,108
I hate that we're
going home empty-handed.

533
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,346
Hey!

534
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,447
Someone shot at us!
Hurley and me.

535
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,719
- We were looking for you when...
- Rousseau.

536
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,658
- Where's Hurley?
- I don't know.

537
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,958
He was right behind me,
then he just...

538
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,362
He just wasn't.

539
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,799
- I'll go and find him.
- No.

540
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,338
- We'll all go.
- Go where?

541
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,541
What the hell happened to you?

542
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,373
Need a battery?

543
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,543
She says "Hey."

544
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,826
- You think of a name yet?
- Huh?

545
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,690
For the baby.

546
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,492
Haven't really thought about it.

547
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,236
I was gonna give it away.

548
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,902
You know, for adoption.

549
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,537
- Must've been a difficult decision.
- Yeah.

550
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,180
Well, doesn't matter now.

551
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,923
It's my birthday today.

552
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,594
Why haven't you told anyone?

553
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:22,224
I'm pregnant, single

554
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,825
and on an island
in the middle of nowhere.

555
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,336
Doesn't really matter
that it's my birthday, does it?

556
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:31,972
I guess not.

557
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,672
Your birthdays will be close,
you and your baby.

558
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,613
- That's good luck.
- Yeah? You think?

559
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,150
Yeah, I do.

560
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:44,653
You believe in that? Luck?

561
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,355
I believe in a lot of things.

562
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,698
That should do it.

563
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,131
Okay. I give up.

564
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,665
What is it?

565
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,174
It's a cradle.

566
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,881
Happy birthday, Claire.

567
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,153
Thank you.

568
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,469
I know food's scarce,
but your shirt?

569
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,808
When you find a laundromat,
let me know.

570
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,816
Back in the jungle,

571
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,257
before we became target practice,
you were gonna tell me

572
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,660
what inspired this little quest.

573
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,545
I think the plane crash
might have been my fault.

574
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,845
- Don't be daft. How could you...?
- Before we came here,

575
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,286
a lot of bad stuff used to happen
whenever I was around.

576
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,381
- What do you mean, like bad luck?
- Yeah, that's...

577
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:31,394
...that'd be kind of
a mellow way of describing it.

578
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:35,796
Hurley, bad things happen.

579
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,458
Planes crash. People die.

580
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,196
You ought to let me finish.

581
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,000
You think you're
the only person with baggage?

582
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,568
You know what I was doing
when the plane went down?

583
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,908
I was snorting heroin. In the toilet.

584
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,710
I was such a junkie,

585
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,776
I couldn't even take a plane ride
without having a fix.

586
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,754
I suppose that was
your fault as well?

587
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,429
So how about it?

588
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,766
What?

589
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,071
I just told you
the biggest secret in my life.

590
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,506
Thought you'd wanna reciprocate.

591
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,178
Okay.

592
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,151
Back home,

593
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,158
I'm worth 156 million dollars.

594
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,333
Fine. Don't tell me.

595
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,104
- Dude.
- I bare my soul,

596
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,772
and all I get is bloody jokes.
