1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,666
Stay down.

2
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:24,690
Your choice, man. Walk away now,
you won't get your ass kicked.

3
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,465
You should've stayed down, Jack.

4
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,663
Jack! Jack!

5
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,072
Jack!

6
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,508
Hey, Jack!

7
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:46,010
There's someone out there!

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,979
- You gotta... The current!
- What?

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,515
There's someone there!
Look!

10
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,641
Help!

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,583
- Help!
- I woke up, and she's...

12
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:57,180
I don't swim.
I don't swim.

13
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,635
You're okay.

14
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:55,807
Just deep breaths now.
Come on. Just breathe.

15
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,749
Just breathe. Yeah.

16
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,878
Did you get her?

17
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,083
What?

18
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,087
There was a woman.
I was trying...

19
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,459
Did you get her?

20
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,424
Help!

21
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:18,262
- We gotta go back.
- Help!

22
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,337
Help!

23
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,501
Come on.

24
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,513
Come on.

25
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,966
- Jack!
- There's someone else still out there.

26
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,595
Hey.

27
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,857
So, what'd they say?

28
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,937
- Jack, maybe you should...
- Who was she?

29
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,607
Her name was Joanna.

30
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,705
She wasn't supposed
to be on the plane.

31
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:10,237
She was scuba diving off the
Barrier Reef and got an ear infection,

32
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,308
and so the doctor grounded her
for two days.

33
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,377
She bumped her flight.

34
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,219
That's how she ended up with us.

35
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,953
She was just swimming
this morning.

36
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,621
Got caught in the riptide.

37
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,622
We've been here six days. I never
talked to her. Never said a word.

38
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,534
- Jack, don't...
- There are 47 of us. Never said a word.

39
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,572
- You tried.
- No, I didn't.

40
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,499
I thought maybe I could...

41
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,740
I thought I could bring him back
and still have the time.

44
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,386
I decided not to go after her.

45
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,791
Jack?

46
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,430
Jack?

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,571
Are you okay?

48
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,973
- Did you see that?
- What?

49
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,171
Standing there in the water,
there was a man.

50
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,109
You didn't see that?

51
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,452
Jack, when was
the last time you slept?

52
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,319
I need to put this
with the rest of the gear.

53
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,669
Who taught you that?

54
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,404
Sun. The Korean lady.

55
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,379
- Don't swallow it.
- Why not?

56
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,748
- Ocean water will make you thirsty.
- Why?

57
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,588
Just don't swallow it, man.
All right?

58
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,194
Have you got it, or what?

59
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,929
You're in my light, sticks.

60
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:21,565
- What the hell is that supposed to...?
- Light, comma, sticks.

61
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,802
As in those legs of yours.

62
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,777
While I love my new nickname,
and I think it's sweet...

63
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,007
Calm down.

64
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,446
I got your damn stuff.

65
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,853
- It'll keep off sand fleas?
- You bet.

66
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,287
Even has aloe.

67
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,823
How much?

68
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,257
- Your money's no good here.
- Then what the hell do you want?

69
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,959
- If you really think I...
- Five grand.

70
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,437
I thought you said my money
was no good here.

71
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,474
I was negotiating.

72
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:59,637
I can take an IOU.
Something tells me you're good...

73
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,646
...for it.

74
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,988
Hey.

75
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,691
You haven't found a hairbrush
in there, have you?

76
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,027
No. Sorry.

77
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,500
God, I must've looked
through 20 suitcases.

78
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,901
Can't find one.
It's weird, right?

79
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,135
I mean, you'd think that
everyone packs a hairbrush...

80
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,698
Whoa.

81
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,208
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's just the heat.

82
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:36,840
Oh.

83
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,374
- And I'm pregnant.
- Really?

84
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,083
Thanks.

85
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,590
What are you doing?

86
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,187
I'm sorting the practical clothes
from the impractical.

87
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,529
- Wanna help?
- Sure.

88
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,804
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. Shoot.

89
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,805
Are you a Gemini?

90
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,967
- Yeah, I am.
- I thought so.

91
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,536
Restless. Passionate.

92
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,481
Everyone thinks astrology
is just a load of crap,

93
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,576
but that's because
they don't get it.

94
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,344
I could do your chart
if you wanted.

95
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,482
Or not.

96
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,751
Geminis.

97
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,259
Hey, Jack?

98
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,292
Whoa.

99
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:35,238
You look tired, brother.

100
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,570
I'm fine.

101
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,872
- What's up?
- We've got a problem.

102
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,575
- That's it?
- That's it.

103
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,674
- How many?
- Eighteen.

104
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,185
People just kinda took
what they needed 'cause...

105
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,617
...we were supposed
to be rescued.

106
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,056
But we weren't.

107
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:57,255
Even if we divvied it up,
it wouldn't be enough for 47 people.

108
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,629
Forty-six.
There's 46 of us now.

109
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,093
If people find out this is all
we have, they'll freak out.

110
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,935
The boar's running low.
What should we tell them?

111
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,703
- I don't know.
- Make water-finding sticks.

112
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,337
- What should we do with what we got?
- I don't know.

113
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,643
- We should put it in the tent, yeah?
- Maybe the dog can find water.

114
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,949
Better if no one
knows how little is left.

115
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,252
Dogs can find pot and bombs,
so I'm sure they can find water.

116
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,952
We tell the others we're running low,
we can ration it.

117
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,019
- Then you can decide...
- I'm not deciding anything!

118
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,128
Why not?

119
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,411
You wanna come in?

120
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,327
So...

121
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,060
You wanna tell me what happened?

122
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,125
A couple of guys
jumped Marc Silverman.

123
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,594
A couple of guys
jumped Marc Silverman.

124
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,369
But they didn't jump you.

125
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,803
No.

126
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,619
I had a boy on my table today.

127
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,145
I don't know, maybe
a year younger than you.

128
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,418
He had a bad heart.

129
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,427
It got real hairy, real fast.

130
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,225
Everybody's looking
to your old man to make decisions.

131
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,698
And I was able to make
those decisions

132
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,168
because, at the end of the day,

133
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,967
after the boy died,

134
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,769
I was able to wash my hands

135
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,243
and come home to dinner,

136
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:57,578
<i>you know, watch a little Carol Burnett, 
laugh till my sides hurt.</i>

137
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,744
And how can I do that?

138
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,621
I mean, even when I fail,
how do I do that, Jack?

139
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,924
Because I have what it takes.

140
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,332
Don't choose, Jack.

141
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,164
Don't decide.

142
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,402
You don't wanna be a hero. You don't
wanna try and save everyone.

143
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:26,434
Because when you fail...

144
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:33,617
You just don't have
what it takes.

145
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,925
Why didn't you leave me?

146
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,058
Hey, I'm talking to you.

147
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,632
- Not now, man.
- I could have made it back.

148
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,064
What? You're not gonna answer me?

149
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,236
- I told you to leave me.
- You were drowning.

150
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,975
- You should've saved her.
- But I didn't save her.

151
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,812
And neither did you.

152
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,349
You think you're all noble and heroic
for coming after me? I was fine.

153
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,358
You're not the only one who knows what
to do around here. I run a business.

154
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,789
Who appointed you our savior, huh?

155
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,291
What gives you the right?
Look at me.

156
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,236
Hey, I'm talking to you.

157
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,705
Look at me, Jack.

158
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,799
Where are you going?

159
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,805
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

160
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,342
Dad?

161
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,503
Your father's gone, Jack.

162
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,937
Did you hear what I said?

163
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,910
He's gone, Jack.

164
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,778
- He'll be back.
- This time it's different.

165
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,952
I want you to bring him back.

166
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,491
- What?
- He hasn't talked to me in two months.

167
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,499
You haven't talked
to him in two months.

168
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,797
He doesn't want me
to bring him back. Trust me.

169
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,532
- Let one of his friends.
- He doesn't have friends anymore.

170
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,267
Why do you think that is?

171
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,709
He was right about you.

172
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,372
Right about what?

173
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,511
- You don't understand the pressure...
- I understand pressure.

174
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,226
Jack, please, you know how he gets.
He doesn't...

175
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,289
He won't take care of himself.
You have to go after him.

176
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,492
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,561
I can't.

178
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,404
"I can't"?

179
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,805
You don't get to say "I can't."

180
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,645
Not after what you did.

181
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,222
You bring your father home, Jack.

182
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,326
Where is he?

183
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,468
Australia.

184
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,119
Hey, hey!

185
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,889
- What's the matter?
- That pregnant lady fell down.

186
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,294
- What happened?
- She just dropped.

187
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,230
It must be the heat.
Is she breathing?

188
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,665
I think.

189
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,362
Let's get her inside.

190
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:54,308
Claire? Claire, honey, wake up.

191
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,211
Claire, can you hear me? Claire?

192
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,647
Come on. Wake up. Come on.

193
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,345
Come on. Please, wake up. Come on.

194
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,151
Claire, can you hear me?
Hi, it's me. It's Kate.

195
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,714
- What...?
- You passed out.

196
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,659
Just take it easy, okay?
She needs water.

197
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,252
- Water.
- Don't move, okay?

198
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,630
She's burning up. She's really hot.
Honey, I think you have a fever.

199
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,898
You need to stay really still.
It's okay.

200
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,496
- Just rest.
- What the...?

201
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,632
The water's gone.

202
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,080
Someone stole it.

203
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,380
- Where is the doctor?
- I don't know. No one can find him.

204
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,512
Was this the last
of the camp's water supply?

205
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,749
Keeping it all in one place. Foolish.

206
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,917
I can go into the jungle
to find fresh water.

207
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,255
You're not going alone.

208
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,421
When the others find out the
water's gone, it's gonna get ugly.

209
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,729
And when they find out that someone
pinched it, it's gonna get uglier.

210
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:57,001
I'll go. Camp needs you two here.
Especially with the doctor gone.

211
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,701
And besides,
I know where to look.

212
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,115
Where are you?

213
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,692
Where are you?

214
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,097
Where are you?

215
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,104
The maid says he hasn't used
the bed in the past three days.

216
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,576
- Did he rent a car from the concierge?
- No, sir.

217
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,975
Quite honestly, Mr. Shephard,

218
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,489
I don't think
your father rented a car at all.

219
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,956
Yeah? Why's that?

220
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:23,256
There was an incident a few nights ago,
here at the hotel bar.

221
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,695
I had to get security
to escort your father to his room.

222
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,490
What's that have to do
with renting a car?

223
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,126
Sorry. I shouldn't have...

224
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,694
What's that have to do
with renting a car?

225
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,798
Mr. Shepherd, I don't think
any rental agent in Sydney

226
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,139
would lease your father
a car in his condition.

227
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,237
My father is the chief of surgery.

228
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,873
Of course, sir. I apologize.

229
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,686
He left his wallet.

230
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,060
Who leaves a wallet?

231
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:03,260
Perhaps you should talk
to the police, Mr. Shephard.

232
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,705
Where are you?

233
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,924
Ah!

234
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,258
No!

235
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,422
Take my hand.

236
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,058
Come on.

237
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,384
You okay?

238
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,805
Hey.

239
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,976
Hey.

240
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,875
- How long have I...?
- A couple of hours. Here.

241
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,709
It's not much,
but it's what we have.

242
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,414
Just relax.

243
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,789
You have to think
about the little one now.

244
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,354
Thanks for the water, Charlie.

245
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,921
There'd be more
if some git hadn't nicked it.

246
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:26,028
- Is Jack back yet?
- No.

247
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,462
No one's seen him.

248
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,835
But I wouldn't worry.

249
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,110
Good ol' Mr. Locke's gone into
the jungle to get some water for you.

250
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,448
Great. Our only hunter's
gonna get eaten

251
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,011
just so he can get
the pregnant girl some more water.

252
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,752
I wouldn't worry. You tell me, who
would you rather meet in a dark alley,

253
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,227
whatever's out there, or that
geezer with his 400 knives?

254
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,958
I mean, who packs 400 knives?

255
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:58,435
Personally, I can only have space
for 200. Three hundred, at most.

256
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,272
When are they gonna rescue us?

257
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,808
Soon.

258
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,986
- Thanks, Charlie.
- For what?

259
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,683
People don't seem
to look me in the eye here.

260
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,717
I think I scare them.
The baby.

261
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,457
It's like I'm this time bomb
of responsibility

262
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,931
just waiting to go off.

263
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,629
You don't scare me.

264
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,638
Uh...

265
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,311
The Chinese people have water.

266
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,851
Where did you get this?

267
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,024
Where did you get this?

268
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,028
- Where did you get...?
- She doesn't understand, Sayid.

269
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,967
She understands me.
Did you steal this water?

270
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,676
Okay, just take it easy. All right?
We just want to talk. All right?

271
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,909
This had water in it. Is it yours?

272
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,220
Who gave you this?

273
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:36,328
- I don't see the water.
- And?

274
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,562
You go after him now,
he'll give you nothing.

275
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,832
But if you wait...

276
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,898
...a rat will always
lead you to its hole.

277
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,533
- Well, it's about time.
- For what?

278
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,570
I made this birthday wish
four years ago.

279
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,434
Where's the water?

280
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,944
- This is better.
- Get off of me.

281
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,408
- Give us the water now!
- Yeah, touch me again, huh?

282
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,679
You really think
I stoled your damn water?

283
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,780
- You gave two bottles to the Koreans.
- I don't give nothing to nobody.

284
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,519
- It's not here.
- I traded Mr. Miyagi

285
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,619
the last of my water
for a fish he caught.

286
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,427
- We worked it out caveman-style.
- You gave him your last two bottles?

287
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,558
Water has no value, freckles.

288
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,626
It's gonna rain
sooner or later.

289
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,002
And, hell, I'm an optimist.

290
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,418
Hey. You forgot something.

291
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,889
Seeing as you're
the new sheriff in town,

292
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,188
might as well make it official.

293
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,202
How are they?

294
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,437
- The others.
- Thirsty.

295
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,735
Hungry. Waiting to be rescued.

296
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:31,179
And they need someone
to tell them what to do.

297
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,342
Me?

298
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,319
- I can't.
- Why can't you?

299
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,190
- Because I'm not a leader.
- And yet they all treat you like one.

300
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,751
I don't know how to help them.

301
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,820
I'll fail. I'll...

302
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,364
I don't have what it takes.

303
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,495
Why are you out here, Jack?

304
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,043
- I think I'm going crazy.
- Oh, you're not going crazy.

305
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,101
No?

306
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,273
Crazy people don't know
they're going crazy.

307
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,579
They think they're getting saner.

308
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,846
So...

309
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,053
...why are you out here?

310
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,892
I'm chasing something.

311
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,229
Someone.

312
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,164
Ah.

313
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,826
The White Rabbit.

314
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,997
<i>Alice in Wonderland. </i>

315
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:30,803
Yeah, Wonderland,
because who I'm chasing...

316
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,240
...he's not there.

317
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,337
- But you see him?
- Yes.

318
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,405
But he's not there.

319
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,080
And if I came to you
and said the same thing,

320
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,883
then what would your explanation be,
as a doctor?

321
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,049
I'd call it a hallucination.

322
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:50,253
Result of dehydration.
Post-traumatic stress.

323
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,593
Not getting more than two hours
of sleep a night. All of the above.

324
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,724
All right.
Then you're hallucinating.

325
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,835
- But what if you're not?
- Then we're all in a lot of trouble.

326
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,503
I'm an ordinary man, Jack.

327
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,707
Meat and potatoes.
I live in the real world.

328
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:14,479
I'm not a big believer in... magic.

329
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,923
But this place is different.

330
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,253
It's special.

331
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,593
The others don't want to talk
about it because it scares them.

332
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,929
But we all know it.
We all feel it.

333
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,370
Is your White Rabbit a hallucination?
Probably.

334
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,339
But...

335
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:40,104
...what if everything
that happened here

336
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,305
happened for a reason?

337
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,882
What if this person
that you're chasing is really here?

338
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:51,115
- That's impossible.
- Even if it is, let's say it's not.

339
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,118
Then what happens
when I catch him?

340
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,254
I don't know.

341
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,895
But I've looked
into the eye of this island,

342
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,402
and what I saw...

343
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,839
...was beautiful.

344
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,678
- Where are you going?
- To find some more water.

345
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,152
- I'll come with you.
- No.

346
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,052
You need to finish
what you started.

347
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,187
Why?

348
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,591
Because a leader can't lead...

349
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,222
...until he knows
where he's going.

350
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,598
Police found him
in an alley in Kings Cross.

351
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,297
Our tox screen showed
a blood alcohol content

352
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,866
which, for a man of his size, probably
brought on myocardial infarction:

353
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,343
a sizable and fatal heart attack.

354
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,142
That's him.

355
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,231
<i>... Oceanic Airlines, 
flight 125 nonstop to Singapore, </i>

356
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:39,936
<i>leaving from gate 14... </i>

357
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,138
You won't put it on the plane?

358
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,271
I'm sorry.

359
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,214
Our policy is that the body
must have proper documentation.

360
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,945
There is no latitude to...

361
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,509
No latitude? No latitude?

362
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,420
- Without the proper documents...
- You can't do this to me.

363
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,186
- I'm ready to go now.
- Perhaps another carrier...

364
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,124
No!

365
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:06,225
I want you to listen to me. Okay?
Because I'm asking you a favor.

366
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:10,673
Chrissy, I'm standing
in front of you in the same suit

367
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:15,201
that I'm wearing to my father's funeral,
and I'm asking you a favor.

368
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,442
In 16 hours,
I need to land at LAX.

369
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,484
And I need that coffin
to clear customs

370
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,951
because there's gonna be
a hearse waiting there.

371
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,048
And I need that hearse to take me and
that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy?

372
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,425
Why can't I bring him to a funeral
home and make all the arrangements?

373
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:34,659
Why can't I really take
my time with it? Because...

374
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:38,099
Because I need it to be done.

375
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,637
I need it to be over.

376
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,502
I just...

377
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,467
I need to bury my father.

378
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,665
Hey. Hey, Claire.

379
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,268
- How did you get...?
- Shh.

380
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,309
Where'd you get that?

381
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,175
- Here's your thief.
- Where'd he hide it?

382
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,517
I don't know.
This wanker had three bottles.

383
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,283
Why did you do it, pretty boy?

384
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:43,225
It was just sitting... It was just
sitting in the tent. Jack just took off.

385
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,922
- Claire could've died.
- I tried to give her some sooner.

386
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,624
It got out of hand.

387
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:50,462
- What is going on?
- Someone had to take responsibility.

388
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,058
Forty would have never last...

389
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,570
Leave him alone!

390
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,549
It's been six days,

391
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,610
and we're all still waiting.

392
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,087
Waiting for someone to come.

393
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,583
But what if they don't?

394
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,459
We have to stop waiting.

395
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,808
We need to start
figuring things out.

396
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,413
A woman died this morning
just going for a swim.

397
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,439
And he tried to save her,
and now you're about to crucify him?

398
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,819
We can't do this.

399
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,653
"Every man for himself"
is not gonna work.

400
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:53,557
It's time to start organizing.

401
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:57,067
We need to figure out
how we're gonna survive here.

402
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,902
Now I found water,
fresh water, up in the valley.

403
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,311
I'll take a group in at first light.
If you don't wanna come,

404
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:11,644
then find another way
to contribute.

405
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,284
Last week, most of us
were strangers.

406
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,316
But we're all here now.

407
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,793
And God knows how long
we're gonna be here.

408
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,697
But if we can't live together,

409
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,829
we're gonna die alone.

410
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,509
So how's it feel?

411
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,021
How's what feel?

412
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,059
Taking my place at the top
of everyone's most hated list.

413
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,661
Sucks, don't it?

414
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,671
Thanks.

415
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,855
So where were you today, Jack?

416
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,588
Just had to take care
of a few things.

417
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,803
That's all I'm gonna get, huh?

418
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,336
My father died.

419
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,403
In Sydney.

420
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,279
I'm sorry.

421
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,180
Yeah.

422
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,017
I'm sorry too.
