1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,351
Charlie.

2
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,319
Charlie.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,087
- How about you and I go for a walk?
- No.

4
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,424
No thanks, Locke.
I'm gonna stay in today.

5
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:30,963
Come on.

6
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,397
Fresh air will do you good.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,399
I take better pictures than that.

8
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:49,011
Smaller too, if you want
something for your wallet.

9
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:52,451
I just came by for a few things
and this was...

10
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,480
This was with my stuff.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,657
So you're not staying?

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,526
Call me a broken record,
but caves are natural shelter.

13
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,156
And a hell of a lot safer
than living on the beach.

14
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,060
- You're mad at me.
- No.

15
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,194
Kate, I'm...

16
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,932
I just don't understand
why you won't come with me.

17
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,102
Us. It's maybe a mile up there. If that.

18
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,272
- I'm not setting up house here.
- I want off this island too,

19
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,542
but we know that's not
gonna happen soon.

20
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,605
Sayid has a plan.

21
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,845
To find the source
of the distress code.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
The signal's coming from the island.

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:32,683
The signal has been running on a loop
for 16 years, Kate.

24
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,250
And the woman that left it,
she wasn't rescued.

25
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,626
What makes you think
it'll be any different?

26
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,096
I believe it.

27
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,032
I wish I shared your faith.

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,797
I wouldn't mind sharing a few things
with her myself.

29
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,965
What do you want, Sawyer?

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,508
Heard the doc here
was vacating the premises.

31
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,841
Thought I'd lay claims to my new digs
before somebody else.

32
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:57,046
I could fix this place up.
Might find somebody to share it with.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,778
I'll talk to you later.

34
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,298
Locke?

35
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,536
Is that you?

36
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,557
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,760
It's been a week
since my last confession.

38
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,130
Go ahead, my son.

39
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:53,332
Last night,
I had physical relations

40
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,341
with a girl I didn't even know.

41
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,309
I see.

42
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,643
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

43
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,740
Right after that I had...

44
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,083
...relations with another girl.

45
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,984
Then straight after that,
I watched

46
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,426
while they had...

47
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:19,993
...relations with each other.

48
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,461
You see, it's my band, Father.

49
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,004
Drive Shaft.

50
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:30,304
We've been playing the clubs
in Manchester

51
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,675
and we've been getting some heat.

52
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,409
A following, you know, and...

53
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,545
The girls...

54
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,421
There's some real temptations
that come with the territory...

55
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,119
...if you know what I mean.

56
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,219
Well, we all have our temptations,

57
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,231
but giving in to them,
that's your choice.

58
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,767
As we live our lives,

59
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,168
it's really nothing but a series
of choices, isn't it?

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,304
Well, then I've made my choice.

61
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,867
I have to quit the band.

62
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,290
And "the meek shall inherit the earth."

63
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:27,629
Liam, what are you doing?
This is a church.

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,191
- Get your boots off.
- Relax, choir boy.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,068
I bring good tidings of great joy.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,640
We've just been signed.
A recording contract.

67
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,144
You're gonna be a rock god.

68
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,433
Nice work, Charlie.

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,561
You make excellent bait.

70
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,768
I'm glad I could oblige.

71
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,542
Now give me my bloody drugs.

72
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,534
Did you hear what I said?

73
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,872
I want my drugs back.
I need them.

74
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,102
Yet you gave them to me.

75
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,111
And I bloody well regret it.

76
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,306
I'm sick, man.
Can't you see that?

77
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,214
I think you're a lot stronger
than you know, Charlie.

78
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,842
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

79
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,387
I'll let you ask me for your drugs
three times.

80
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,446
The third time,
I'll give them to you.

81
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,856
Now, just so we're clear.
This is one.

82
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,123
Why? Why?

83
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,630
Why are you doing this?
To torture me?

84
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,563
Get rid of them
and have done with it.

85
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,760
If I did that,
you wouldn't have a choice.

86
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:13,169
Having choices, making decisions
based on more than instinct

87
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,470
is the only thing
that separates you from him.

88
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,681
Three antennae.

89
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,775
Three points of a triangle.

90
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,410
One here on the beach.

91
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,753
Another, Kate will position in the
jungle, roughly two kilometers in.

92
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:36,124
And the third, I'll take
to high ground up there.

93
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,495
If the French transmission is coming
from somewhere within our triangulation,

94
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,659
I'll be able to locate the source.

95
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,761
- But there are two complications.
- Of course there are.

96
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,740
The power cells I've grafted
onto the antennas are dry.

97
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,606
No telling how long they'll last.

98
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,908
A minute. Maybe more.
Maybe less.

99
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,007
So we have to wait
until we're in position.

100
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,110
How are we gonna tell
that we're in the right position?

101
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,655
We have no way to communicate
with each other.

102
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,081
Bottle rockets?

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,288
Thank God for firework smugglers.
When I'm in position,

104
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,024
I'll fire off my rocket.

105
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,999
When you two see it,
you fire yours.

106
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,595
As soon as the last one has gone up,
we'll all switch on our antennas.

107
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,438
- You said two complications.
- The battery in the transceiver's dead.

108
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,808
Without the transceiver,
all of this is for nothing.

109
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,245
Something from a laptop
would probably work,

110
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:33,445
- But I've not found anything.
- I think I might know where to look.

111
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,285
You've been hoarding like a packrat,
and you don't have a single laptop?

112
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,326
We are testy.

113
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:44,295
Still upset about your little breakup?
You and Jacko.

114
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:45,728
It must be exhausting.

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,995
- What's that?
- Living like a parasite.

116
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,832
Always taking, never giving.

117
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,838
Boy, you got me pegged,
don't you?

118
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:58,536
I get it. You don't want off this island
because there's nothing to go back for.

119
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,637
Nobody you miss.
And no one misses you.

120
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,777
Oh, you're feeling sorry for me.

121
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:09,311
I don't feel sorry for you.
I pity you.

122
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:23,099
All you had to do was say please.

123
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,600
What's in these things,
cinder blocks?

124
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,774
Packed everything I thought useful,
without leaving the others short-handed.

125
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,077
You guys need a hand?

126
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,482
I used to lug the band's equipment

127
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,488
before we had roadies,
way back in the day.

128
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,252
- Here, let me...
- No, Charlie. The zipper's...

129
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,818
...broken.

130
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,126
- Sorry. I was trying to help.
- I know. It's okay.

131
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,195
Hey, you wanna help me grab
the rest of those bags?

132
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,966
Oh, could I?

133
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,278
What are you doing?

134
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,550
Oh, uh... I have a... headache.

135
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,885
Diazepam.

136
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,224
It's for anxiety.

137
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:28,996
- I was looking for aspirin.
- Pretty strong stuff for a headache.

138
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,230
- Yeah, right.
- Hey.

139
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:36,207
- You okay? You're looking a little...
- It's nothing. It's just a headache.

140
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:41,243
Charlie, leave it. Go get some water.
Maybe you're dehydrated.

141
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,406
Charlie, I got it.

142
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,013
Go take care of yourself, man.

143
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,344
I don't need you right now.

144
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,728
Come on, Charlie-boy,
we can't do this without you.

145
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,435
You are bloody Drive Shaft.

146
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,943
Watch the language.

147
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,242
This is our shot at the big time.

148
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,407
What? You don't want to be famous?

149
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,077
It's not about that.
I only care about the music.

150
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,416
Your music,
your songs that got us signed.

151
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,150
I'm just a clown with a pretty face
that sings them.

152
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,715
You wanna take away my chance
to be somebody?

153
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,590
Liam, it's not about you.

154
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,062
It's... I love the band...

155
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,262
It's not who I am.
Sometimes I just get lost in it.

156
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,931
Won't happen.
I'll be there looking out for you.

157
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,204
We'll look out for each other.
What brothers do, right?

158
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,403
Right?

159
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,640
Wait, wait, wait.

160
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,682
Just promise me one thing.

161
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,083
If things get too crazy,
no matter what,

162
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,748
if I say we're done, we walk away.

163
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,385
- We walk away.
- Liam, promise.

164
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,723
We walk away.

165
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,664
You're the rock god, baby brother.

166
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,572
- You wanker!

167
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,214
Oh!

168
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,435
Hey, dude, this yours?

169
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:53,876
Oh, yeah.

170
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,210
I play bass in Drive Shaft.

171
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,046
<i>I wrote a bunch of tunes on that.
You All Everybody. </i>

172
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,554
Listen, man. Jack just wants you
to find another place for it.

173
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,954
He's moving supplies
and says it's in the way.

174
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,493
You know, a lot of people
look up to me.

175
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,865
- They respect me, and you...
- Charlie...

176
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,700
You treat me like a bloody child,
some useless joke.

177
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,899
- What?
- "Charlie's not good enough."

178
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,499
- "Charlie's in the way."
- Let me look at you.

179
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,512
You'll look out for me?
We'll look out for each other.

180
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,741
Calm down.
You're not yourself right now.

181
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:32,579
You don't know me!
I'm a bloody rock god!

182
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,118
Oh, no.

183
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,154
Oh!

184
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,630
Charlie, where's Jack?

185
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,506
Where's Jack?

186
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,889
Jack!

187
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,120
- Jack, can you hear me?
- I don't know what happened.

188
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,752
We were talking and it came down.

189
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,320
- It happened so fast.
- We gotta get help.

190
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:23,494
- Go down to the beach and get help!
- Okay, I'm on it.

191
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,127
And make sure you tell Kate!

192
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,132
What we're doing,

193
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,201
chasing some phantom distress signal,

194
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,110
what are the odds of this working?

195
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,480
No worse than the odds of us
surviving that plane crash.

196
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,078
- People survive crashes all the time.
- Not like this one.

197
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,123
The tail section broke off
when we were still in the air.

198
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,886
Our section cart-wheeled,

199
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,826
and yet we escaped
with nothing but a few scrapes.

200
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,022
How do you explain that?

201
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,689
Blind, dumb luck.

202
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,733
No one's that lucky.
We shouldn't have survived.

203
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,365
Sorry, Sayid,
but some things just happen.

204
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,034
No rhyme, no reason.

205
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,667
Hey!

206
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,609
Hey!

207
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,648
- We need help!
- What's wrong, man?

208
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,649
- It's Jack. He's trapped.
- What?

209
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,550
- Our cave collapsed. We've got to go.
- Hey, Scott?

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,848
- I'm Steve.
- I'm Scott.

211
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,855
We got an emergency.
Let's go.

212
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,016
- We gotta go now.
- Come on, go.

213
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,992
Come on, let's go.

214
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,956
Shannon, you have to be ready
to do something important.

215
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,865
At 5:00 sharp, you need
to be ready to turn that antenna on.

216
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,234
- There's a switch at the base.
- Why?

217
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,138
Kate and Sayid
are triangulating the French signal,

218
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,335
but the antenna's power is really weak,

219
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,311
so you have to wait until
they fire their bottle rockets.

220
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,008
Then you fire this one,
then you turn on the antenna.

221
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,812
Got it?

222
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,487
- The switch is where now?
- Did you hear a word I said?

223
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,023
- Can you or can't you do it?
- Yeah, I can.

224
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,752
Okay, okay.

225
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,524
Wait. Kate.

226
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,397
- Hey, we have to tell Kate about Jack.
- Sorry, sport, you just missed her.

227
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,698
Her and Muhammad
headed into the woods.

228
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,704
- Which way?
- Don't sweat it, amigo.

229
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,569
- I know which way they went.
- But...

230
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:13,010
I'll tell her. You just keep doing
whatever it is you do around here.

231
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,592
<i>* You all everybody</i>

232
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:35,122
<i>* You all everybody</i>

233
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,431
<i>* Acting like you're stupid people</i>

234
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,769
<i>* Wearing expensive clothes</i>

235
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,570
<i>* You all everybody</i>

236
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,243
<i>* You all everybody</i>

237
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,280
<i>* You all everybody *</i>

238
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,694
All right! All right, all right.

239
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,731
Hey, mate.
Thanks for coming in.

240
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,602
What the hell was that?

241
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,470
Another kick-ass show.
You were bloody brilliant.

242
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,601
<i>I sing the chorus to You All Everybody. </i>

243
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,338
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

244
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,848
I got caught up in the moment.
Like the crowd wanted it, you know.

245
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,612
I know, but if I start
and then you come in after...

246
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,084
She's cool. Let her in.

247
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,316
It won't happen again.
I promise.

248
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,888
Hello, lovely.

249
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,802
Chill, baby brother.

250
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,313
- Hey. Hey, wait!
- Jack's in there.

251
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,857
Let me check it out
before you move things.

252
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,983
- If it's unstable...
- How do you know?

253
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,518
Eight years of construction work.
I don't want you near the rocks.

254
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,827
- Take the dog.
- You should get Mr. Locke.

255
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,062
Locke's in the jungle killing stuff.
Who knows where he is.

256
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,742
All right.
This area here is load bearing.

257
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,938
We gotta dig where there's
no danger of the wall buckling in.

258
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,615
All right, here. We dig in here
so the wall doesn't collapse.

259
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,020
Four at a time, by hand,
till we can find some kind of shovel.

260
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,184
We take shifts and go slow.

261
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,922
Whoever isn't digging
should be clearing the rocks

262
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:47,932
and bringing water to who is working.
Okay? Let's move.

263
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,003
Hey.

264
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,940
What the hell are you doing here?

265
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,706
Easy. I just came
to tell you something.

266
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,613
What makes you think I'm interested
in anything you have to say?

267
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,823
You were right about me.

268
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:19,125
That I don't help anyone but myself.

269
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,361
Well, here I am.
Ready to pitch in.

270
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,595
You're here to help?

271
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,429
Hey, you act any more surprised,
I'm gonna get offended.

272
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,845
Something wrong, Charlie?

273
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,920
Yeah. Jack.

274
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,392
He's...

275
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,725
There's been an accident
in the caves.

276
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,663
Jack's trapped in a cave-in.

277
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,799
- Is anyone trying to get him out?
- There's a bunch of people there now.

278
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,864
And why aren't you with them?

279
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,750
You didn't come to tell me
about Jack, did you?

280
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,017
I want my stash, Locke.

281
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,155
I can't stand feeling like this.

282
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,858
Come here.
Let me show you something.

283
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,700
What do you suppose
is in that cocoon, Charlie?

284
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,573
I don't know.
A butterfly, I guess.

285
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,517
It's much more beautiful than that.
That's a moth cocoon.

286
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,214
It's ironic.
Butterflies get all the attention.

287
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,484
But moths, they spin silk.

288
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,584
- They're stronger, faster...
- That's wonderful, but...

289
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,528
You see this little hole?

290
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,690
This moth's just about to emerge.

291
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,758
It's in there right now, struggling.

292
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,929
It's digging its way through
the thick hide of the cocoon.

293
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,839
Now, I could help it.

294
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:14,436
Take my knife,
gently widen the opening,

295
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,174
and the moth would be free.

296
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,978
But it would be too weak to survive.

297
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,784
The struggle is nature's way
of strengthening it.

298
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,450
Now, this is the second time you've
asked me for your drugs back.

299
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,890
Ask me again and it's yours.

300
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,675
Keep going. Keep going.

301
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,015
We're through.
We got a hole.

302
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,581
Jack!

303
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,559
Jack! Can you hear me, Jack?

304
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,260
Come on, dude, answer me.

305
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,696
- Oh!
- I hear him!

306
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,138
- He's alive.
- Jack, bro, you okay?

307
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm pinned. I can't move.

308
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:27,178
I can't move.

309
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,478
What do we do?
How do we get him out?

310
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,891
- Charlie was with me.
- He's okay. He made it out.

311
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,159
- Listen, Jack?
- Yeah?

312
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,292
We're gonna get you out of there, okay?

313
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:58,174
We'll place the second antenna here.

314
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,717
You want to help?

315
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:07,853
Attach this antenna up in that tree.
As high up as you can.

316
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,394
Golly, thanks, boss.

317
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,659
Five o'clock.
Watch for my flare.

318
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,637
Then it's your turn.

319
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,333
I don't trust him.

320
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,436
Who does?

321
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,813
I don't trust him with you.

322
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,613
I can handle him.

323
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,553
Okay. We can't safely
make that tunnel any bigger.

324
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,496
But since Jack can't get out, one of us
is gonna have to go in and unpin him.

325
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,399
- Crawl through that?
- He means someone smaller.

326
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,171
Dude, we don't understand Chinese.

327
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,763
Korean, man.

328
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,676
- They're Korean.
- I'll do it.

329
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,773
Charlie?

330
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,383
No, man.
You're still too shook up.

331
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,475
- I might be able to squeeze...
- Wait.

332
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,544
Who's gonna take care of your son
if something happens?

333
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,759
She's got a husband.
He's got a sister.

334
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,022
I'm alone here.

335
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,128
No one on the island.

336
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,529
Let me do this.

337
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,113
Still ain't five, just like
the last time you checked.

338
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,309
I don't want to miss
Sayid's signal.

339
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,909
I'll fire the flare,
you set off the antenna.

340
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,616
I just thank the good Lord
I got you here to keep reminding me.

341
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,989
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

342
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,625
So, what is it about that guy?

343
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,729
Jack.

344
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:02,740
What is it about him that
makes you all weak in the loins?

345
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,641
Do you try to be a pig
or does it just come naturally?

346
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,541
It's that he's a doctor, right?
Yeah, ladies dig the doctors.

347
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,585
Hell, give me a couple of Band-Aids,
a bottle of peroxide,

348
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,621
I could run this island too.

349
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:19,384
You're actually comparing yourself
to Jack?

350
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,755
The difference between us
ain't that big, sweetheart.

351
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,289
I guarantee you if he had survived
a few more weeks on this island,

352
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,858
you'd have figured that out.

353
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,664
What did you just say?

354
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,941
Ah, damn. Didn't I tell you?

355
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:46,313
Word from the valley is Saint Jack
got himself buried in a cave-in.

356
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,654
- What?
- Look at the bright side,

357
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,555
now you have someone else to pity.

358
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,026
Listen, man.
Go slow, all right?

359
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,971
Try not to nudge
any of the rocks around you.

360
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,136
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Good luck.

361
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:17,407
- Be safe, man.
- Good luck, Charlie.

362
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,780
All right. Thanks, guys.

363
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,173
Drive Shaft! Drive Shaft!
Drive Shaft!

364
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,577
Everybody wants a piece.
Everybody wants more.

365
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,555
Everybody wants another piece.

366
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,217
They can't leave you alone
when you're on top...

367
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,590
Bloody hell.

368
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:08,524
Hey, baby brother.
Grab a bird and sit down.

369
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,195
Get out.
You too, get out.

370
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,703
- Out!
- Out?

371
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,262
Come on. Now!

372
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,467
Come back in five minutes.

373
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,539
Sound check.
You missed sound check.

374
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,643
You don't show up for rehearsal.
We've got a show in an hour.

375
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,416
Ooh! A show. I like shows.

376
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,024
Oh, yeah.

377
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,020
All right. That's it.

378
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,294
After tonight,
we cancel the rest of the tour.

379
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,597
- What?
- We walk away.

380
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:45,897
Are you off your head?

381
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,962
Like we said we would
if things got...

382
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,803
Walk away and go where?

383
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:55,074
You're killing yourself with this junk.
You're destroying Drive Shaft.

384
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:57,171
I am Drive Shaft!

385
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,775
No one even knows who
the sodding bass player is.

386
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,685
This is it, Charlie.
End of the rainbow.

387
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,814
You really think you can walk away?

388
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,981
Then what, eh?

389
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:12,189
Face it. If you're not in this band,
what the bloody hell use are you?

390
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,469
- Liam.
- Piss off!

391
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,395
Charlie?

392
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,934
Charlie, move!

393
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,136
Charlie!

394
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,933
I'm, uh...

395
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,200
I'm here to rescue you.

396
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,014
- We try again.
- We can't leave them.

397
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:14,540
- They're gonna run out of air.
- Stop talking. I'm trying to think.

398
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,984
Where is he?

399
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,715
- Where is he?
- Kate.

400
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,280
Where is he?
Where's Jack?

401
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,232
He's in there.

402
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,802
Does anyone know if he's alive?

403
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,135
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

404
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,178
Charlie went in there
through a tunnel that we dug.

405
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,441
But it collapsed.

406
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,676
Why is nobody digging?

407
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,853
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

408
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,434
Okay. One, two...

409
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,662
... three!

410
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,904
- Oh!
- Sorry, Jack. Sorry.

411
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,999
You all right?

412
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,679
- My shoulder's dislocated.
- What?

413
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,246
- You're gonna have to pop it back in.
- No, I can't.

414
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,184
- I need your help.
- I can't do it.

415
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,482
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

416
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,648
Yes, you can.

417
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,750
Okay.

418
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,192
What do I... What do I do?

419
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,189
- Take my hand.
- This hand? Okay.

420
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,427
Okay, wait. Okay.

421
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:42,371
Now, when I tell you to,
pull as hard as you possibly can.

422
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,203
I don't know if...

423
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,708
You can do this, Charlie.

424
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,679
Okay, okay, okay.

425
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,578
Now.

426
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,854
Charlie.
What are you doing here?

427
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,357
A bloke can't pay
his big brother a visit?

428
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:37,519
Of course you can.
Why didn't you call, you lunatic?

429
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,223
What are you doing in Sydney?

430
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,856
It's all lined up, Liam.

431
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:46,165
Eight weeks on tour, opening
for some band called Meat Coat.

432
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,369
First gig's in Los Angeles.

433
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,440
LA, Liam.

434
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,211
This is a chance
to get back on a label.

435
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,273
A real one.

436
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,716
This is our comeback.

437
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,989
Charlie, I don't want to come back.

438
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:11,521
Yeah. Right. Well...

439
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,894
Here's the thing.

440
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:18,265
They won't book Drive Shaft
without you.

441
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,240
So, I'm asking...

442
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,208
...as a brother...

443
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,336
...the way you asked me.

444
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,838
You were with me the night
I missed Megan's birth.

445
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:37,217
You were the one I was stumbling around
Dresden with trying to find a fix.

446
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:47,091
- You're still using, aren't you?
- Don't change the subject.

447
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,429
That's why you haven't
returned my calls.

448
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,060
- You gonna do this tour?
- You said you'd get help.

449
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,160
I lost your number.

450
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,933
- You're still a junkie.
- You did this to me!

451
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,134
It was about the music.

452
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,508
Music, Liam.

453
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,208
You took that away from me.

454
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,485
Listen.

455
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,316
Why don't you stay with us
for a few weeks?

456
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,290
Karen and me,
we can get you help.

457
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,760
- Sydney's got really good programs...
- Forget it.

458
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,160
Don't go.

459
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,664
- Thanks for your help.
- Stay. Please.

460
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:25,863
- I was just looking out for you.
- You never looked out for me.

461
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,707
I have a plane to catch.

462
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,347
How long has it been?

463
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,182
I don't know what
you're going on about.

464
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,885
How long since your last fix?

465
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,224
Almost a day and a half.

466
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:02,431
How's the withdrawal treating you?
Any hallucinations?

467
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:06,273
Apart from the conversation I had with
you about an hour ago in the jungle.

468
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,709
No, not really.

469
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:14,042
Why didn't you say anything?
I could've helped you through this.

470
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,085
Yeah. You thinking I'm useless
and a junkie to boot.

471
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,557
Useless? You're not useless.

472
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,925
That took a lot of guts getting in here
and trying to rescue me.

473
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,762
I won't forget that.

474
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:30,460
For the rest of our lives?

475
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:39,306
At the rate we're using our oxygen
in here, that won't be too long.

476
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,271
This place reminds me of confession.

477
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,308
Those little claustrophobic booths.

478
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,379
I wouldn't have taken you
for a religious man.

479
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,019
I used to be.

480
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,862
You want to hear my confession?

481
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,921
It might take a while.

482
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,765
Hey, I'm no saint, either.

483
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,605
What's wrong?

484
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,035
- It's a moth.
- A what?

485
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,568
Right behind you.
There's a bloody moth in here.

486
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,635
Look.

487
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,449
Charlie, what are you doing?

488
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,662
Kate, you need to take a break.

489
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,966
I'm fine.

490
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,744
We've got enough people to dig.

491
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,782
You keep going at this pace,
you're gonna kill yourself.

492
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,850
There's light.

493
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,656
- What?
- I can see light.

494
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,521
- Hey, it's the doctor!

495
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,034
Oh! Ow! Easy.

496
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,570
My shoulder, careful.

497
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,913
- How did you get out?
- Charlie.

498
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,579
- Charlie found a way out.
- Dude, you rock.

499
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,221
You okay?

500
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,694
- Nice work.
- You did it.

501
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,032
Thanks. Thank you.

502
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,848
All right, everyone.
Now it's your turn.

503
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,451
- We're in Malibu part of the year,

504
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,122
but the guys there are such idiots...

505
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,531
Damn it.

506
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,833
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

507
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,913
Come on, Kate. Come on.
One more. One more.

508
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,454
Come on, Kate.
Come on.

509
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,918
Yes. Yes.

510
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,432
Where are you?

511
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,300
Yes!

512
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,672
Where are you?
Where are you?

513
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,601
Dude, you feeling okay?

514
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,466
- You look a little...
- Flu.

515
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,006
- He's got the flu.
- Oh, man, that's rough.

516
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,804
After all you've been through.
Take it easy, man.

517
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:29,658
I think I'm gonna stretch my legs.

518
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,081
This place is cool.
Can we live here?

519
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,200
Made you something.

520
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:07,704
Aw. My very first sling.

521
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:10,634
How's that?

522
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,642
Good.

523
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,673
Thank you.

524
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:20,039
So these are the safe caves
you've been going on about.

525
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,584
This was a fluke.

526
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:25,918
Michael checked out the integrity
of the rest, gave them an okay.

527
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,854
- You're headed back to the beach, huh?
- Sayid should be back by now,

528
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,556
and if his plan worked, then...

529
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,657
Then we're one step closer
to getting off this island.

530
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,712
Thanks for the sling, Kate.

531
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,109
You're welcome.

532
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,733
Give them to me.

533
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,834
This is the third time.

534
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:24,938
- Are you sure you really want it?
- I've made my choice.

535
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,913
I'm proud of you, Charlie.

536
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,410
I always knew you could do it.
