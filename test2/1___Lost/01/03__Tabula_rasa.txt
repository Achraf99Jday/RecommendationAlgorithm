1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,663
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,167
Do you think he's gonna live?

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,775
- Do you know him?
- He was sitting next to me.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,340
You think they
would have come by now.

5
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,544
- Who?
- Anyone.

6
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,021
What is it, like checkers?

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,957
Not really.
It's a better game than checkers.

8
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,461
Two players. Two sides.

9
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,726
One is light. One is dark.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,089
Walt...

11
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:38,998
...do you wanna know a secret?

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,755
Don't trust her.

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,821
She's dangerous.

14
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,960
- Try not to move, man.
- I have to find her.

15
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:13,699
- I have to bring her back.
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

16
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,300
Every time I ask who you have to
bring back, you pass out on me again.

17
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,676
Since your fever's pretty high,
I'm guessing you have no idea

18
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,716
- Who the hell you're talking about.
- My cuffs.

19
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,808
My handcuffs.

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,016
- Where are my cuffs?
- What?

21
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,852
- My jacket pocket.
- I don't...

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,522
- Jacket pocket!
- Okay.

23
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,969
Dangerous.

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,271
She's dangerous.

25
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,428
- It's getting dark.
- Pick up the pace.

26
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,128
- Hick.
- A little louder?

27
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,726
We should make camp.

28
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,931
- What, here?
- Yes, here.

29
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,406
I'm not stopping.
Have a nice cookout.

30
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,933
- Walk through the jungle in the dark.
- Afraid the trees will get us?

31
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:29,004
No. What is knocking
down the trees will get you.

32
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,846
You're so worried, how about
you give me the clip back?

33
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,351
Put your gun in your pants.

34
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,911
Sayid's right. Keep walking,
you're not gonna make it to the beach.

35
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,890
Yeah, why's that?

36
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,451
Trust me.

37
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,788
This is Australia.

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,198
- This is us.
- Nice stick.

39
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,601
Two days ago,
we take off from Sydney.

40
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,662
We fly along the same northeast route

41
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,538
every commercial airliner
bound for Los Angeles does.

42
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,510
The pilot said he lost
communication with the ground?

43
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,571
Yeah, six hours in.
He turned around and headed for Fiji.

44
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
So we changed course.

45
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,210
Regrettably,
no one knew we changed course.

46
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,721
The turbulence hit.

47
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,749
We know the rest.

48
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,389
The pilot said we were
over 1,000 miles off course.

49
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,388
They'll find us.

50
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:23,060
They have satellites that can
take pictures of your license plate.

51
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,570
If only we were all
wearing license plates.

52
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:30,167
- Aren't you the pessimist.
- Basic photography: point and shoot.

53
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,406
Satellites can shoot,
but they must be told where to point.

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:36,846
Oh. Bollocks.

55
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,908
Okay, really enjoyed
the puppet show. Fantastic.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,853
So we're stuck
in the middle of damn nowhere.

57
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,913
How about we talk
about that other thing?

58
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,251
The transmission Abdul
picked up on his radio.

59
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,196
The French chick that said,
"They're all dead."

60
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,530
The transmission's been on a loop for...
How long, freckles?

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,228
- Sixteen years.
- Right.

62
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,274
Let's talk about that.

63
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,507
We have to tell the others
when we get back.

64
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,516
- Tell them what exactly?
- What we heard.

65
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,781
- I'm not a stupid translator.
- No one tell them anything.

66
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:21,721
To relay what we heard without fully
understanding it will cause a panic.

67
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:25,059
If we tell them what we know,

68
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,190
we take away their hope.

69
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,932
And hope is a very
dangerous thing to lose.

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,335
So we lie?

71
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,211
- Was it a dinosaur?
- It wasn't a dinosaur.

72
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,412
- You said you didn't see it.
- I didn't.

73
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,746
So, how do you know
it wasn't a dinosaur?

74
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,723
Because dinosaurs are extinct.

75
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,118
Oh.

76
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,593
Yeah.

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,333
So, what's his story?
He looks kind of...

78
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,170
...dying.
- He's not gonna die.

79
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,298
- He's yellow.
- His wound is infected,

80
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,639
- But the antibiotics will fight it off.
- What if they don't?

81
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,580
- His body will shut down...

82
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,138
...one piece at a time.

83
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,014
His abdomen goes rigid, then...

84
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,115
- He looks like he's in pain.

85
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,683
Yeah.

86
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,863
What's this?

87
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,567
Uh... Dude?

88
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,296
Uh...

89
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,373
- What do you think she did?
- None of my business.

90
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,041
- She looks pretty hardcore.
- Hurley.

91
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,515
What are you doing?

92
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,095
I'm standing guard.
You heard what they said's out there.

93
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,755
You took my gun off me, boy?

94
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,527
He doesn't believe in guns.
He goes on marches.

95
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,398
- I don't.
- Give it back.

96
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,097
- Aljazeera will protect us.
- Aljazeera's a network.

97
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,266
- I'll keep the damn gun.
- We should give it to her.

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,247
- Yeah. Kate should hold the gun.
- Fine with me.

99
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:02,977
Well?

100
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,138
- Good morning.
- Morning.

101
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,340
- You're sleeping in my sheep pen.
- Sorry.

102
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,644
- How'd you get here?
- I walked.

103
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,018
- You walked?
- Yeah.

104
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,580
- From where?
- Town.

105
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,117
- Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
- Maybe that's why I'm exhausted.

106
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,629
What's your name?

107
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,295
- Annie.
- You hungry, Annie?

108
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:58,403
So, you want to tell me why
you're trespassing on my property?

109
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,469
I ran out of money.

110
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
You're an American?

111
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,877
Canadian. I graduated from college
and figured I'd see the world.

112
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,980
Australia was top of my list,
so I hopped a flight to Melbourne,

113
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:14,720
but I don't know anybody here,
so I figured I'd walk for a while.

114
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,957
Melbourne's a hundred
kilometers from here.

115
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,361
I like walking.

116
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,923
And you just happened
to wander onto my farm?

117
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,393
I like farms too.

118
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,841
Do you know how to work one?

119
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,845
Yeah.

120
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,685
My wife died
eight months ago Wednesday.

121
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,449
She left me with too many chores
and a hell of a mortgage.

122
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,989
If you help me with the first one,

123
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,190
I'll give you a fair wage
and a place to stay.

124
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,829
Deal.

125
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,735
Uh...

126
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,341
I'm a lefty.

127
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,239
Dude. Dude!

128
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,414
Hey, dude, they're back.

129
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,953
As you and the others know,
we hiked up the mountain

130
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,049
in an attempt to help
the rescue team locate us.

131
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,922
The transceiver failed
to pick up a signal.

132
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,022
We weren't able to send out
a call for help.

133
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,999
But we're not giving up.

134
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,868
If we gather electronic equipment,
your cell phones, laptops,

135
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,874
I can boost the signal,
and we can try again.

136
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,433
But that may take some time,
so for now,

137
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,241
we should begin
rationing our remaining food.

138
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:45,148
If it rains, we should set up
tarps to collect water.

139
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:48,414
I need to organize
three separate groups.

140
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,786
Each group should have a leader.
One group for water.

141
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:55,623
I'll organize that. Who's gonna
organize electronics? You?

142
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,356
Rationing food?

143
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,694
Okay.

144
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:04,361
And I will need a third group to concern
themselves with the construction...

145
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,598
- Hi.
- Hey.

146
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,775
l, uh...

147
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,172
I need to tell you something.

148
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,582
Okay. Sure.

149
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:26,547
- ... stay out of the sun.
- We couldn't send out a signal

150
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,459
because there was
another signal blocking it.

151
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,025
The other signal, we heard it.

152
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,000
It was a distress call
from a French woman.

153
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,171
She said that the others were dead.

154
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,039
That something had killed them all.

155
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,204
She was alone on the island.

156
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,144
It's been playing for 16 years, Jack.

157
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,320
I wanted to tell you.

158
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,367
Anything else?

159
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,545
How is he?
The man with the shrapnel in his side.

160
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:29,312
- He's touch-and-go.
- Did he wake up?

161
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,722
Just for a few seconds
during the surgery.

162
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,493
He say anything?

163
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,425
No.

164
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,305
So, what did she say?

165
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,375
She didn't say anything.

166
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,581
But you told her you knew.

167
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,653
I don't know anything.

168
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,217
Well, you kinda know
she's in that mug shot.

169
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,092
And we found those handcuffs.

170
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,997
And that guy keeps mumbling
"She's dangerous" over and over.

171
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,434
It's not my business.
Not my problem.

172
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,366
Yeah, you're right.

173
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,675
We'll let Johnny Fever take care
of her when he gets better.

174
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,115
He's not getting better
if we don't get stronger antibiotics.

175
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,915
- That stuff from the luggage...
- For ear infections and foot fungus.

176
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,615
We went through everything.

177
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,148
What about that luggage
in the overhead compartments?

178
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,957
- That's inside the plane.
- Yeah?

179
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,930
But the bodies are in there,

180
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,060
and they're all... dead.

181
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,307
- I'll handle it. Keep an eye on...
- Great. Yeah, I'd love to. On it.

182
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,580
Boo.

183
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,281
- What are you doing in here?
- Trick-or-treat. Same as you.

184
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,755
You're looting.

185
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,589
Ah, you say "potato..."

186
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,598
<i>- What's in the bag?
- Booze, smokes, a couple Playboys. </i>

187
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,464
- What's in yours?
- Medicine.

188
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,527
Well, just about sums it up, don't it?

189
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,699
You do this back home too?
Steal from the dead?

190
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,767
Brother, you got to wake up
and smell the gull crap here.

191
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,177
Rescue ain't coming.

192
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,680
You're just wasting your time,

193
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,548
trying to save a guy who,
last time I checked,

194
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,818
had a piece of metal the size of my head
sticking out of his breadbasket.

195
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,026
Let me ask you something.

196
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,654
How many of those pills
you gonna use to fix him up?

197
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,789
- As many as it takes.
- Yeah?

198
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,857
How many you got?

199
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,809
You're just not looking
at the big picture, doc.

200
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,868
You're still back in civilization.

201
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,709
Yeah? And where are you?

202
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,681
Me?

203
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,741
I'm in the wild.

204
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,028
Whoa. Whoa.
Hey, I got it. I got it.

205
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,072
Thanks.

206
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,198
I got it. I got it. Yeah.

207
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,207
Well, look on the bright side.

208
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,976
Whoever's this was is
probably better off than we are.

209
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,607
I got it.

210
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,284
- How's the baby?
- It's okay, I think.

211
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,188
Good.

212
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,060
So your...

213
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,323
Your husband,
was he on the flight?

214
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,365
Oh, no, I'm not married.

215
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,691
Oh.

216
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,566
I know. How modern of me.

217
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,001
Well, who needs men, right?

218
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,599
Bloody useless.

219
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,078
So you guys hiked all the way up
that mountain for nothing, huh?

220
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,452
Hey. Sorry.

221
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,856
I was gonna get some more water.

222
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,122
We haven't met. I'm Kate.

223
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,155
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi.

224
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,667
Hurley.

225
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,597
I was looking for Jack.
I thought he might be there.

226
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,040
Yeah, no.

227
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,977
He went to go get some medicine.
Over there.

228
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,549
- Where, in the fuselage?
- What?

229
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:05,386
Yeah. Yeah, in the,
uh, uh, uh...

230
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,119
You know,
I got to go get that water.

231
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,778
The bank would have
given you a heck of a toaster

232
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,839
if you'd kept that
in a savings account.

233
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,249
What do I need a toaster for?

234
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,378
You're hiding your wages
in a tin can.

235
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,913
I mean, I would have
held onto it for you.

236
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,289
I got trust issues.

237
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,091
- Weren't you gonna say goodbye?
- I wrote you a note.

238
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,767
You've been here
almost three months,

239
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,140
and every time
I ask you about yourself,

240
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,202
you get that look in your eye.

241
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,974
Yeah, that one.

242
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,377
So I mind my own business.

243
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,978
I figured maybe you got off on
the wrong side of a bad relationship.

244
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,389
Maybe you ran. I always knew
you'd leave here someday.

245
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,485
I guess I hoped it wouldn't be
in the middle of the night.

246
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,330
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

247
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,932
So am I.

248
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,610
Annie, why don't you
just stay one more night?

249
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:11,012
I'll drive you to the train station
first thing in the morning. I promise.

250
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:19,086
- Okay.
- Good.

251
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,083
I get it, you know.

252
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,459
Everyone deserves a fresh start.

253
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,714
- Damn it! Let her go, damn it!

254
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,553
- No!

255
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,295
Breathe! Come on!

256
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,992
Come on. Look at me! Look...

257
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,739
What did you do?

258
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,139
I was just checking to see if he...

259
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,044
He jumped on me.
He grabbed me.

260
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,678
Is he... okay now?

261
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,314
He's not responding to antibiotics,

262
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,291
he's bleeding internally,
and his fever's pushing 104...

263
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,695
...and his abdomen's rigid.

264
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,104
He needs water.

265
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,104
So, what are you gonna do about it?

266
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,843
- About what?
- About him.

267
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,909
- I told you, he needs water.
- Will he suffer?

268
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,549
- What?
- Will it be quick?

269
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,525
No, it won't be quick.

270
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,460
- Two, three, maybe four days.
- And he'll feel it?

271
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,793
Yeah, he'll feel it.

272
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,629
Can't you put him out of his misery?

273
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,073
I saw your mug shot, Kate.

274
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,611
I am not a murderer.

275
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,752
<i>Leavin' On Your Mind</i>

276
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,326
Do they listen to Patsy Cline
in Canada?

277
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,767
They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.

278
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,905
- You hungry?
- I'll eat on the train.

279
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,603
You sure?

280
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,374
A little place up here
makes a mean burger.

281
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,649
- What are you looking for, Ray?
- What?

282
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,952
I'm not. Just...

283
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,162
How long have you known?

284
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,237
Couple of days.

285
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,867
I saw your picture in the post office.

286
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,104
I guess they knew
you were Down Under.

287
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,207
Why?

288
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:34,013
The reward's $23,000.

289
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,419
I told you when I met you.
I got a hell of a mortgage.

290
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,190
If it makes you feel any better,
it was a hard decision, Annie.

291
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,660
My name's not Annie.

292
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,525
- Who's that you were hanging out with?
- What guy?

293
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,929
- You know, the bald guy.
- Oh, Mr. Locke?

294
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,796
Mr. Locke.

295
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,737
- Mr. Locke got any kids?
- He didn't say.

296
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,774
- Yeah, what did he say?
- I don't know.

297
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,742
What do you mean,
you don't know? What did he say?

298
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,472
Some of it's secret.

299
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,107
He tell you not to tell me?

300
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,674
- No.
- Then what's the secret?

301
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,419
Mr. Locke said
a miracle happened to him.

302
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,863
Yeah, well, a miracle
happened to all of us, Walt.

303
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,762
We survived the plane crash.

304
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,998
- I don't want you hanging around him.
- Why not? He's my friend.

305
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,407
Hey, I'm your friend too.

306
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,842
If you're my friend, you'd find Vincent.

307
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,237
Walt...

308
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,879
Look, I haven't given up on your dog.

309
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,285
I'm gonna do everything
I can to find him.

310
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,915
- You won't. You don't care.
- Yeah, I will.

311
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,960
I'm gonna get your dog back
as soon as it stops raining.

312
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,963
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get your dog back.

313
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,531
Yeah.
"As soon as it stops raining."

314
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:39,600
Good. Nice.

315
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,743
I'm gonna find your dog.

316
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:49,446
Yeah, I'm just gonna go walking
through the haunted damn jungle,

317
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,820
- Looking for your...

318
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,362
Vincent?

319
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,964
Vincent.

320
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,167
- That you, buddy?

321
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,595
Oh.

322
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,962
Something was, uh...
chasing me, so, uh...

323
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,803
Yeah, I don't hear it now. Uh...

324
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,039
But y-you should probably, uh...

325
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,241
...head... back.

326
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,653
Uh...

327
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,021
l-l-I didn't see anything. Uh...

328
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,559
You know,
i-if you're worried about it,

329
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:09,361
l-I didn't see anything.

330
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,815
What are you making?

331
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,364
A whistle.

332
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:46,635
I used some tribal flutes once
in a recording session.

333
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,134
I'm in a band.

334
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,986
I wish he would just die already.

335
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,046
Real humane, Shannon.

336
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,792
Anything I can do to help?

337
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,992
No, I'm good. Thanks.

338
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:20,998
The others are getting upset. They want
to know what's going on inside the tent.

339
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,165
I'm trying to save his life.

340
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,769
Rumor has it you can't.

341
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,037
Need a light?

342
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:08,443
Came by to thank you.

343
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:14,384
- You gonna ask what for?
- What for?

344
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,127
- For taking that gun away from me.
- I didn't take it away.

345
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,030
Stickin' out of your denims, ain't it?

346
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,696
Sure wouldn't want to be
the one with that gun right now.

347
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:35,707
Everyone who's sitting there listening
to that poor boy scream all night

348
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,044
knows what's got to be done.

349
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,246
Only one that can do it...
is the one with that gun.

350
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:47,751
Don't act so surprised. Heard
you tell the hero the same thing.

351
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,929
Hell, there's only one bullet left.

352
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,988
Be damn near poetic.

353
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,746
- Listen to me...
- No, you need to keep quiet.

354
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,314
Listen to me.
No matter what she does,

355
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,485
no matter how she makes you feel,

356
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,587
just don't...
trust a word that she says.

357
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,794
She will do anything to get away.

358
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,299
- What did she do?
- I want to talk to her.

359
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,434
- Tell me what she did.
- I want to talk to her alone.

360
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,250
She got to you too, huh?

361
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,577
Hey, Kate.

362
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:11,855
What was it?

363
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,966
- What?
- The favor.

364
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

365
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:22,803
Last thing I heard before the crash,
you wanted a favor.

366
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:37,421
<i>The captain has switched on
the "fasten seat belts" sign. </i>

367
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,979
<i>Return to your seats
and fasten your seat belts. </i>

368
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,720
- I have one favor to ask.
- Really?

369
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,785
This ought to be good.

370
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,320
Well?

371
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,720
I wanted you to make sure
that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.

372
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,530
What, the guy who...
ratted you out?

373
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,974
He had a hell of a mortgage.

374
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,070
Kate...

375
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,547
...you really are one of a kind.

376
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,851
You know, you would have got away
if you hadn't saved him.

377
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,194
In case you hadn't noticed,
I did get away.

378
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,562
You don't look free to me.

379
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,501
Kate, I'm gonna die, right?

380
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,671
- Yeah.
- So...

381
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,740
...are you gonna do it...

382
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,012
...or what?

383
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,828
Yo.

384
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,426
So, where's the fugitive?

385
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,970
In the tent.

386
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,033
You let her in there alone?

387
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,511
What's she gonna do?
She's 120 pounds soaking wet.

388
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,276
Yeah, but she's got that gun.

389
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:48,375
- What?
- She's strapped, man. I saw it in...

390
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:50,250
...in her...

391
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:53,423
Kate.

392
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,804
- What did you do?
- What you couldn't.

393
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,916
I get where you're coming from,
being a doctor and all.

394
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,545
But he wanted it.
Hell, he asked me.

395
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,953
So I don't like it
any more than you do...

396
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,091
...but something had to be done.

397
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,688
Oh, no way.

398
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,096
Guys.

399
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,835
Oh...

400
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,174
- You shot him in the chest?
- I was aiming for his heart.

401
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:51,010
- You missed.
- Man, is he still breathing?

402
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,711
You perforated his lung.
It'll take hours to bleed out.

403
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,151
- There was...

404
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,519
- I only had one bullet.
- Get out.

405
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,489
Get out!

406
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,291
Oh, boy.

407
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,642
Damn it!

408
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,230
Shh.

409
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,396
I found your son's dog.

410
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,963
- What?
- Vincent?

411
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,135
I tethered him
to a tree just over there.

412
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,309
I know that Walt lost his mom.

413
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,748
I thought that you should be the one
to bring his dog back to him.

414
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,317
- Hey, thanks.
- Welcome.

415
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,019
I want to tell you what I did.

416
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,088
Why he was after me.

417
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,863
I don't want to know.

418
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,329
It doesn't matter, Kate,

419
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,428
who we were,

420
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,065
what we did before this,
before the crash.

421
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,166
It doesn't really...

422
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,948
Three days ago, we all died.

423
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,453
We should all be able to start over.

424
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,266
- Okay.
- Okay?

425
