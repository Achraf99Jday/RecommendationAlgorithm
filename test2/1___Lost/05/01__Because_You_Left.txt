1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:03,134 --> 00:00:07,234
Ladies and gentlemen, the survivors of Oceanic 8-1-5.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,133
I just killed a man who's been perched...

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:14,734
outside this facility for the last week.

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:16,426
I want you to come with me somewhere safe.

6
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:17,801
You and I have common interests.

7
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:20,300
We're not the only ones who left the island.

8
00:00:20,334 --> 00:00:24,534
We... were not supposed to leave. 
- Bye, Jack.

9
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,966
We have to go back, Kate.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,933
Did he tell you that I was off the island?

11
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,801
Yes, he did. 
He said that I had to come back.

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,567
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,966
Ah. Mm. Baby's awake.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,833
It's your turn.

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,367
Morning. 
Here you go, Doc.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,367
I don't need a script.

17
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:05,701
Let's go. I don't have all day.

18
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,567
Speed.  
- Okay.

19
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,133
Dharma orientation film number two,

20
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,233
take one.

21
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,467
And... action.

22
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,033
Hello. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle,

23
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,801
And this is the orientation film for station two,

24
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,133
the Arrow.

25
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:28,900
Given your specific area of expertise

26
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,100
you should find it no surprise

27
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:32,966
that this station's primary purpose

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
is to develop defensive strategies

29
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,734
and gather intelligence

30
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,933
on the island's hostile indigenous population-

31
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,534
Dr Chang!

32
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,367
Dr. Chang?  
- Damn it! What the hell?!

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,833
- Cut!  
- Sir, we got a problem down at the Orchid.

34
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,267
Over here.

35
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,267
We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs.

36
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,334
That's when the drill melted.

37
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:16,300
- The drill melted?  
- Yeah, yeah.

38
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,267
3 meters from the margin line on the plans.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,133
We went through six carbon drill bits,

40
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,734
and the last one just fried.
Then my operator

41
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,734
starts grabbing his head and freaking out.

42
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,400
We sonar-imaged the wall.

43
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:33,500
There's an open chamber about 20 meters in,

44
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,100
behind the rock.

45
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,966
There's something in there.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,667
And the only way to get to it

47
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,833
is to lay charges here and here

48
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,683
and blast through it and take a look-

49
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,500
Under no circumstances.

50
00:03:47,534 --> 00:03:51,400
This station is being built here because of its proximity

51
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,933
to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy.

52
00:03:53,966 --> 00:03:56,400
And that energy, once we can harness it correctly,

53
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:59,734
it's going to allow us to manipulate time.

54
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,200
Right.

55
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:04,634
Okay, so what? 
We're gonna go back and kill Hitler?

56
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:06,300
Don't be absurd.

57
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:08,233
There are rules,

58
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,467
rules that can't be broken.

59
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,801
So what do you want me to do?

60
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,434
You're gonna do nothing.

61
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:19,567
If you drill even 1 centimeter further,

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,866
you risk releasing that energy.

63
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,833
If that were to happen...

64
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:29,434
God help us all.

65
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,701
All right, get him up. 
- Come on. Let's go.

66
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,133
Watch yourself!

67
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,634
Sorry, sir. 
It won't happen again.

68
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,534
Come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff.

69
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,900
Let's go.

70
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,267
Did you hear that?

71
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:57,800
Time travel.
How stupid does that guy think we are?

72
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,967
Let's go, guys.

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,833
Why don't you close that up now, Jack?

74
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,600
Come on.

75
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,600
Let's get him in the van. 
It's out back.

76
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,566
Where are we taking him?

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,933
We'll worry about that once we pick up Hugo.

78
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,566
Hurley...

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
is locked away in a mental institution.

80
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,766
Which should make recruiting him

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,133
considerably easier than the rest of your friends.

82
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,766
They're not my friends anymore.

83
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,267
Oh, that's the spirit.

84
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,833
How did we get here?

85
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,633
How did all this happen?

86
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,499
It happened because you left, Jack.

87
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:17,433
Now let's get started, shall we?

88
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,366
So once we get Hurley... then what?

89
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,033
Then we get Sun, Sayid...

90
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,700
And Kate, of course.

91
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,499
I don't see that happening.

92
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,234
When was the last time you saw him?

93
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:52,900
I mean, Locke.

94
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:57,200
On the island...

95
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:02,433
In the Orchid station, below the greenhouse.

96
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,433
I told him I was sorry

97
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,967
for making his life so miserable,

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,633
and then he left.

99
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,000
So obviously John's visit to you made an impression.

100
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,333
What did he say to make you such a believer?

101
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,700
Sawyer,Juliet,

102
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,599
everyone from the boat... and everyone we left behind-

103
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:35,200
John said that they'd die, too, if I didn't come back.

104
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:40,634
Did he tell you what happened to them after the island moved?

105
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,800
No.

106
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,466
No, he didn't.

107
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,433
Then I guess we'll never know.

108
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,467
What the...

109
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,500
Richard?  
Richard?!

110
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,900
Anyone?

111
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,633
Anyone?!

112
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,700
What happened?

113
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:18,900
What was that light?

114
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,967
We must've been inside the radius.

115
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,997
What the hell was that?

116
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know.

117
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,234
Where's the freighter?

118
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,000
-Maybe it went down. 
-Unh-unh. No way.

119
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,133
A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke.

120
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:53,300
Now there's just nothin'?

121
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:55,733
What about the helicopter?

122
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,933
It was heading for that boat.

123
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,600
Rose!

124
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:05,234
Rose!

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,433
-Bernard! 
-Rose!

126
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,566
Have you seen Rose?! 
-No.

127
00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:14,933
Oh, my God!

128
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,000
-Bernard! 
-Rose!

129
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,100
-Where were you? 
-I was over... by the church.

130
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,755
Wh-what was that sound? What was that light? 
-I don't know.

131
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:25,366
Just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right?

132
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,234
We'll just go back to camp and- 
-"Calm down"?

133
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:31,499
"No need to panic"?
We can't go back to the camp. 

134
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:34,000
-What the hell are you talking about?
-There is no camp.

135
00:10:38,234 --> 00:10:41,167
The--the sky lit up, a--and then this.

136
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,200
The--the kitchen?
Gone.

137
00:10:46,766 --> 00:10:50,599
And--and all the tents, all the food and water... gone.

138
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,466
Well, everything but us. All of it.

139
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:54,867
It's gone.

140
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,234
It's not gone.

141
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:01,133
Daniel!

142
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,967
Hey.

143
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,100
I thought you were on the freighter.

144
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,333
No, we never made it.

145
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,172
We were on our way out there when it happened.

146
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,600
What do you mean, the camp's not gone?

147
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:14,730
-Who the hell are you anyway? 
-That's Dan.

148
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:17,167
He's our physicist.
-Listen, we have no time. 

149
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
I need you to take me to something man-made,

150
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,000
something that was built, any kind of a landmark.

151
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,000
There's a Dharma station 15 minutes from here.

152
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,533
You mean the hatch? The one we blew up?

153
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,033
That's perfect.

154
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,867
We should get moving before it happens again, okay?

155
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,800
Before what happens again?

156
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,000
And why is our camp gone?

157
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:41,067
Your camp isn't gone.

158
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,533
It hasn't been built yet.

159
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Choo choo! Tunnel!

160
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:23,100
Oh, I think choo choo knows better than that.

161
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,600
He goes into that tunnel, he's never coming back out.

162
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,600
Watch your cartoons, Goober.

163
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,700
Mommy'll be right back.

164
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:41,200
-Ms. Austen? 
-Yes?

165
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:44,766
Hi, I'm Dan Norton of the law firm Agostoni & Norton.

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,733
May we have a moment of your time?
- And who are you?

167
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,334
He's my associate.

168
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:51,600
If I could just come in, I'll be glad to explain-

169
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:54,000
No, you can explain right here.

170
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,900
Okay, you got it.

171
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:59,033
Ms. Austen, we're here to get a blood sample from you

172
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:03,733
and one from your son Aaron.
- Excuse me?

173
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:06,800
Now I have a court order signed by a judge

174
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,833
for you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers

175
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:14,334
- Why?  
- To determine your relationship to the child

176
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm sorry. I don't understand. 
Um, who's the--

177
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,433
I'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.

178
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,766
- Your client?  
- Please, may we come in?

179
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,833
- Get off my property.  
- If you won't comply,

180
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,833
then I'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.

181
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,867
Then come back with the sheriff.

182
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:40,566
(Spring boinging)

183
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,566
Where you going, mommy?

184
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,300
We're going on vacation, baby.

185
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,234
Say bye-bye, baby.

186
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,267
Why did you jump off that helicopter?

187
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,766
I told you. 
We were runnin' out of gas.

188
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,033
I wanted to make sure she--

189
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,466
I wanted to make sure they got back to the boat.

190
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,867
Don't matter now anyway, does it?  
- Excuse me.

191
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,833

I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. 
Okay? Thanks.

192
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,800
First things first.

193
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,067
Gimme your shirt.

194
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,533
- My shirt?  
- Yeah.

195
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:07,432
I really think we have far more pressing matters

196
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,399
than me giving you a shirt.

197
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:13,067
How about we just keep moving, okay?  
- How about we call a time-out

198
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,867
so you can tell us what the hell is going on?  
- How about you trust me?

199
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,241
Trust you?

200
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,967
I don't know you!  
- We really do not have time for me to try to explain.

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,499
You have no idea

202
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,466
How difficult that would be for me to try to explain

203
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,566
this--this phenomenon to a quantum physicist.

204
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,399
That would be difficult,

205
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,533
so for me to try to explain whatever is happening--

206
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,566
Oi!

207
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,633
What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?

208
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,334
Shut it, Ginger, or you're gettin' one, too.

209
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Now talk.

210
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,200
The island...

211
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,734
think of the island

212
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,233
like a record spinning on a turntable...

213
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:53,400
only now that record is skipping.

214
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,534
Whatever Ben linus did down at the Orchid station...

215
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,567
I think...it may have...

216
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
dislodged us.

217
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,734
Dislodged us from what?

218
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,600
Time.

219
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,267
So that's why our camp is gone?

220
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,801
Because the island is moving through time?

221
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,333
Yeah, either the island is, or we are.

222
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,000
What?

223
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,834
And it's just as likely that we're moving,

224
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,000
your people and us.

225
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,734
And everyone in your group-- you're all accounted for, right?

226
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,367
Not everyone...

227
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,467
Locke.

228
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,667
Is anyone there?!

229
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,767
Hello?!

230
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,133
Hello?!

231
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,667
Hey!

232
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,367
Uhh!

233
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,000
Who are you?

234
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,367
- Well, listen, listen-  
- How many others onboard?

235
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,100
You don't understand. 
I didn't come on that plane.

236
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,400
Wrong answer.

237
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,166
No, wait! Stop! Stop!

238
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
I know you. I know who you are.

239
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,867
Your name...

240
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,001
Your name is Ethan.

241
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:41,734
- Your name is Ethan.  
- Who are you?

242
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,700
My name is John Locke.

243
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,166
I know this is gonna be hard to understand,

244
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,200
but Ben Linus appointed me as your leader.

245
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,500
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

246
00:19:56,967 --> 00:20:00,001
Good-bye, John Locke.

247
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,901
Great.

248
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:35,300
So when are we now, whiz kid?

249
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,433
We're either in the past...

250
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,300
or we're in the future.

251
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,333
Flight 23 to Paris

252
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,333
will begin boarding at gate 15.

253
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,300
Please have your boarding passes ready.

254
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:59,001
(In french)

255
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,600
Evening, ma'am. Where you flying to tonight?

256
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,133
Los angeles.

257
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,667
Of course. may I see your passport, please?

258
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,867
Excuse me.

259
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:22,066
Could you wait here for just one moment, Ms. Kwon?

260
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,600
Hey! Where are you going?

261
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,600
Open this door.

262
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:39,534
Open this door!

263
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,534
Save your breath.

264
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,267
They only do what I tell them to do.

265
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,600
You.

266
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,833
-For you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers

267
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:14,334
- Why?  - To determine your relationship to the child

268
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm sorry. I don't understand. um, who's the--

269
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,433
I'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.

270
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,766
- Your client?  - please, may we come in?

271
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,833
- Get off my property.  - if you won't comply,

272
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:28,833
Then I'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.

273
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:31,867
Then come back with the sheriff.

274
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:40,566
(Spring boinging)

275
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,566
Where you going, mommy?

276
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,300
We're going on vacation, baby.

277
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,234
Say bye-bye, baby.

278
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,267
Why did you jump off that helicopter?

279
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,766
I told you. we were runnin' out of gas.

280
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,033
I wanted to make sure she--

281
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:50,466
I wanted to make sure they got back to the boat.

282
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,867
- Don't matter now anyway, does it?  - excuse me.

283
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,833
I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. okanks.

284
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:57,800
First things first.

285
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,067
Give me your shirt.

286
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,533
- My shirt?  - yeah.

287
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:07,432
I really think we have far more pressing matters

288
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,399
Than me giving you a shirt.

289
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:13,067
- How about we just keep moving, okay?  - how about we call a time-out

290
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,867
- So you can tell us what the hell is going on?  - how about you trust me?

291
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,241
Trust you?

292
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,967
- I don't know you!  - We really do not have time for me to try to explain.

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,499
You have no idea

294
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:24,466
How difficult that would be for me to try to explain

295
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,566
This--this phenomenon to a quantum physicist.

296
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,399
That would be difficult,

297
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,533
So for me to try to explain whatever is happening--

298
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,566
Oi!

299
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,633
What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?

300
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,334
Shut it, ginger,or you're get one too

301
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Now talk.

302
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,200
The island...

303
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,734
Think of the island

304
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:50,233
Like a record spinning on a turntable...

305
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:53,400
Only now that record is skipping.

306
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:59,534
Whatever Ben linus did down at the orchid station...

307
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:02,567
I think it may have

308
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
Dislodged us.

309
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:06,734
Dislodged us from what?

310
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,600
Time.

311
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:14,267
So that's why our camp is gone?

312
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,801
Because the island is moving through time?

313
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:19,333
Yeah, either the island is, or we are.

314
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,000
What?

315
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:23,834
And it's just as likely that we're moving,

316
00:16:23,867 --> 00:16:26,000
Your people and us.

317
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,734
And everyone in your group-- you're all accounted for, right?

318
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,367
Not everyone.

319
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,467
Locke.

320
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,667
Is anyone there?!

321
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,767
Hello?!

322
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,133
Hello?!

323
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,667
Hey!

324
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,367
Uhh!

325
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,000
Who are you?

326
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,367
- Well, listen, listen  - how many others onboard?

327
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,100
You don't understand. I didn't come on that plane.

328
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,400
Wrong answer.

329
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,166
No, wait! stop! stop!

330
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
I know you. I know who you are.

331
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,867
Your name...

332
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:38,001
Your name is ethan.

333
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:41,734
- Your name is ethan.  - who are you?

334
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:43,700
My name is john locke.

335
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:46,166
I know this is gonna be hard to understand,

336
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,200
But ben linus appointed me as your leader.

337
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,500
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

338
00:19:56,967 --> 00:20:00,001
Good-bye, john locke.

339
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,901
Great.

340
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:35,300
So when are we now, whiz kid?

341
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,433
We're either in the past...

342
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,300
Or we're in the future.

343
00:20:44,934 --> 00:20:47,333
flight 23 to paris

344
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,333
Will begin boarding at gate 15.

345
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:51,300
Please have your boarding passes ready.

346
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:59,001
(In french)

347
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,600
Evening, ma'am. where you flying to tonight?

348
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,133
Los angeles.

349
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:08,667
Of course. may I see your passport, please?

350
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,867
Excuse me.

351
00:21:18,901 --> 00:21:22,066
Could you wait here for just one moment, ms. kwon?

352
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:35,600
Hey! where are you going?

353
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:37,600
Open this door.

354
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:39,534
Open this door!

355
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,534
Save your breath.

356
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,267
They only do what I tell them to do.

357
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,600
You.

358
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,367
You had me brought in here?

359
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Why?

360
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:54,433
You had the audacity

361
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:56,400
To approach me in broad daylight

362
00:21:56,433 --> 00:22:00,400
In front of my business associates... In public.

363
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,734
Why did I have you brought here?

364
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,066
Because you showed me no respect.

365
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,033
I will be respected, sun.

366
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,467
Fair enough.

367
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,233
Since you seem to be worried about your plane,

368
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,166
I'll get right down to business.

369
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,901
You mentioned that you and I had...

370
00:22:21,934 --> 00:22:24,200
Common interests.

371
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:31,066
Why don't you tell me exactly what they might be?

372
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:36,200
To kill benjamin linus.

373
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:44,400
The victim was found shot in his car

374
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:47,233
On the grounds of the santa rosa hospital,

375
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,597
A private mental health care facility outside los angeles. okay.

376
00:22:49,597 --> 00:22:50,300
Let's go get him.

377
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,033
Police have now identified their suspect in the shooting

378
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:55,001
As a patient at the hospital

379
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:57,433
Who escaped earlier this evening--hugo reyes.

380
00:22:57,467 --> 00:23:00,200
Now if that name sounds familiar to you,

381
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,634
That's because reyes was a member
Of the infamous oceanic six.

382
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,066
As to why he may have murdered a visitor to the facility

383
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,934
Where reyes lived for two years,

384
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,700
That remains a complete mystery.

385
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,133
Well...

386
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,733
Looks like we have a change of plan.

387
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:30,400
Here she comes, right now.

388
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:31,932
Here's your order, sir.

389
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,799
-Keep the change. -thank you.

390
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,066
Awesome.

391
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,300
-You want a fry? -no, thank you.

392
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,767
You know, maybe if you ate more comfort food

393
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
You wouldn't have to go around shooting people.

394
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,033
So that dude you popped outside santa rosa--who was he?

395
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:08,500
I don't care. he was armed and he was watching you.

396
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,500
That made him an enemy.

397
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,633
Do you think he was gonna kill me?

398
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,099
I'm not taking any risks. after bentham died--

399
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,600
-You mean locke. -Yes, I mean locke.

400
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,932
I need a cool code name.

401
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,667
So when'd you become so paranoid?

402
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,667
If you'd spent the last two years

403
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,633
Doing the things I was doing,

404
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:33,733
You'd be paranoid, too.

405
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:35,066
Oh, yeah?

406
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,533
Paranoid? like what?

407
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:39,366
What kind of things?

408
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,333
I was working for benjamin linus.

409
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:45,600
Wait. he's on our side now?

410
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:49,099
Listen to me, hurley.

411
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:52,400
If you ever have the misfortune of running into him,

412
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,133
Whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.

413
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:07,433
Wait here.

414
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:03,066
-Is he all right? -I don't know.

415
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:07,832
Is he breathing or what? who is that? check him out.

416
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:12,033
Look out! that guy's got a gun! run! get out of here! call the cops!

417
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,433
Hurry!

418
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,033
Sayid!

419
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:26,500
You okay?

420
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:28,633
Get me to the car.

421
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:31,133
Dude. dude.

422
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,633
Oh, man.

423
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:35,133
I thought it was supposed to be a safe house.

424
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:37,033
I never should've left the island.

425
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Hey, do you think he's looking for us?

426
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:59,366
Who?

427
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:01,133
Widmore.

428
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:05,433
It took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time.

429
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,399
I'll start holding my breath now.

430
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,234
Over here!

431
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,499
-Is this the hatch? -it was.

432
00:27:23,533 --> 00:27:27,234
Blown up, just like we left it.

433
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,133
Okay.

434
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,234
So when we are now...

435
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:35,433
It's now after you and your people crashed on the island.

436
00:27:35,466 --> 00:27:39,399
-You sayin' our camp is back on the beach again? -it's possible, yeah.

437
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:42,300
-Good. I'm going back. -hey. no, no.

438
00:27:42,334 --> 00:27:45,466
-It's pointless. -more pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?

439
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,399
We don't know when the next flash is coming.

440
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,100
By the time you get back to the beach,

441
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:52,466
-The camp could be gone again. yeah, -but what if it ain't?

442
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:54,900
Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?

443
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,867
We could warn them

444
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,334
Stop them from ever flying to that boat.

445
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,733
That's not the way it works.

446
00:28:01,766 --> 00:28:02,933
Who says?

447
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,733
You cannot change anything. you can't.

448
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:08,167
Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work,

449
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,133
Why not?

450
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:12,800
Time--it's like a street, all right?

451
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,733
We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse,

452
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:18,267
But we cannot ever create a new street.

453
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,267
If we try to do anything different,

454
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,267
We will fail every time.

455
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,399
Whatever happened, happened.

456
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,067
How do you know so much about this, danny boy?

457
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:40,600
I know about this because...

458
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:43,733
I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time.

459
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,700
I know all this because

460
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:48,100
This journal contains everything I've ever learned

461
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,067
About the dharma initiative.

462
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,033
This is why I'm here.

463
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:56,399
I know what's happening.

464
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,666
So how can we stop it?

465
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,234
We can't stop it.

466
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,334
Then who can?

467
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,234
Richard?

468
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:03,499
john

469
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,334
Richard...

470
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,000
What is happening?

471
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:15,600
What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.

472
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,833
Here.

473
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,933
I need to get the bullet out.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,433
How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, richard?

475
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:31,867
Because you told me there was, john.

476
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,267
No, no. no, I didn't.

477
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,733
Well... you will.

478
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,167
It was ethan who shot me.

479
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,366
What comes around, goes around.

480
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,633
When am i?

481
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,900
Well, john, that--that's all relative.

482
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,033
Wait, wait.

483
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:59,533
The--the noise, when the sky lit up... where did you go?

484
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:03,067
I didn't go anywhere, john. you went.

485
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,033
All right, this--this is gonna hurt.

486
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:08,600
It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? hold still.

487
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,766
Uhh! all done.

488
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,533
Jeez.

489
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,833
I don't understand.

490
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:27,399
How--how did you know that I was here?

491
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:30,033
How did you know where to find me? I wish I had time to explain it, john.

492
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,366
But you're gonna be moving on soon,

493
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,533
And we need to go over a couple of things before you do. "moving on"? aah!

494
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:37,900
Sorry. the first thing, okay?

495
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:40,267
You're gonna need to clean out the wound

496
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,000
Every couple of hours

497
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:45,200
And keep as much weight off the g as you can, all right?

498
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:47,334
The island'll do the rest, john, all right? but I don't--

499
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:48,733
Second thing-- no, no, pay attention.

500
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,067
Next time we see each other, I'm not gonna recognize you.

501
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,499
All right? you give me this. all right? what is this?

502
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:57,366
It's a compass. what does it do?

503
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,133
It points north, john.

504
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,100
Look, I wish I had time to be more sensitive about this

505
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:05,100
Because it's a lot to swallow,

506
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:09,033
But you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do.

507
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:11,000
So I'm just gonna say it, okay?

508
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:13,600
The only way to save the island, john,

509
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,566
Is to get your people back here--the ones who left. jack, kate...

510
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,067
The chopper was headed for the boat. the boat--

511
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,566
No, they're fine, john, and they're already home,

512
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,933
So you have to convince them to come back.

513
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:26,566
How--how am I supposed to do that?

514
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
You're gonna have to die, john.

515
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,066
So... what was this thing before you guys blew it up?

516
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:38,666
A dharma station. for what?

517
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,800
There was a man named desmond living down in it.

518
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:43,232
He was pushing a button every 108 minutes

519
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,865
To save the world.

520
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,899
Really?

521
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:49,066
Yeah. really.

522
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:56,832
Son of a...

523
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,299
Bitch.

524
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,932
The hatch--it's back.

525
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,166
I guess you haven't found it yet.

526
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:43,433
Hey! where you goin'?

527
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:46,865
Back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.

528
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,700
James, wait. not a good idea.

529
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,700
The sky can flash all it wants,

530
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,666
But I ain't startin' over, dilbert.

531
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,499
I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and making a fire,

532
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,999
And I ain't huntin' damn boar!

533
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,633
There's dharma food, beer and clothing in there.

534
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:05,633
And I'm gettin' desmond to let me in one way or another.

535
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:07,599
That's not gonna work, my friend.

536
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,166
When he first came out of there.

537
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:15,066
That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.

538
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,066
Th would all be fascinating if I was listening to ya.

539
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:20,599
So how you do know desmond is even in there?

540
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,599
Think about it. it could be anybody. 

541
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,599
I don't care who's in there.

542
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:24,633
Wait.

543
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,766
-Wait. -open the damn door!

544
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,766
-It won't work. -sure it will.

545
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,399
Yo, open up! it's the ghost of christmas future!

546
00:36:32,433 --> 00:36:34,999
No one--no one is gonna answer. 

547
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:35,999
open! open the damn door! open the door!

548
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:37,832
You're wasting your time. 

549
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:38,832
open up! I know you can hear me.

550
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:41,832
If it didn't happen, it can't happen.

551
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:46,599
-Open the damn door! -you can't change the past, james!

552
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:51,266
Everybody I care about just blew up on your damn boat.

553
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,333
I know what I can't change.

554
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:03,666
We should get back to the beach.

555
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:07,566
It's been a long day.

556
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:25,366
Why are we going back to the beach

557
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,832
If there's nothing to go back to?

558
00:37:27,865 --> 00:37:29,766
So stay here.

559
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:34,666
That chick likes me.

560
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,266
What?

561
00:37:42,299 --> 00:37:44,832
Wh-- what? what's the matter?

562
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:47,633
You...

563
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:53,132
Ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed since I was little.

564
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,766
Dan, I'm fine.

565
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:57,865
Yeah. no, no, no, you're-- um, of course you're fine.

566
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,566
I'm, uh... you know, the sight of blood is,..

567
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,566
Yeah, well, it's a good thing

568
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,800
You're a physicist then, isn't it? shall we?

569
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:07,266
Yeah, um... my pack.

570
00:38:07,299 --> 00:38:10,399
Of course I left my pack back at the hatch crater.

571
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,399
I better get it.

572
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:15,333
Why don't you head back with everyone else?

573
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:17,299
-And I'll be right behind you. -don't dillydally.

574
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:20,366
I wouldn't think of it.

575
00:38:47,865 --> 00:38:50,132
Please let this work.

576
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,099
Please let this work.

577
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:54,700
Please, please, please, let this work.

578
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,766
-Don't shoot. -then you'd best explain

579
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,733
Why you've been bangin' on my door

580
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:10,132
For the last 20 minutes, brother.

581
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,533
Desmond.

582
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:16,533
Are you him?

583
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:18,366
"him"? who?

584
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,999
My replacement.

585
00:39:22,366 --> 00:39:24,066
No, I'm not.

586
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,466
I'm not. I'm not. I'm...

587
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,232
Do I know you?

588
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,266
Yeah... in a way.

589
00:39:32,299 --> 00:39:34,366
But listen, that's not important.

590
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,299
What is important, desmond, is what I'm about to say to you.

591
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,199
I need you to listen.

592
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:43,700
You're the only person who can help us because, desmond...

593
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:45,399
The rules...

594
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:49,132
The rules don't apply to you. you're special.

595
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,466
You're uniquely and miraculously special.

596
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:53,399
What are you talking about?

597
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,166
Okay, listen to me. listen!

598
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,466
If the helicopter somehow made it off the island,

599
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:05,032
If you got home--

600
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:06,728
What helicopter? what are you talking about?

601
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:08,932
listen, I need you to listen, or people are gonna die.

602
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:13,433
My name is daniel faraday, and right now

603
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,399
Me and everyone else you left behind--

604
00:40:15,433 --> 00:40:17,066
We're in serious danger.

605
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,366
You're the only person who can help us. I need you

606
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:23,066
To go back to oxford university. go back to where we met.

607
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,832
I need you to go there and find my mother. her name is--

608
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,299
Are you all right?

609
00:40:42,932 --> 00:40:45,433
I was on the island.

610
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:50,466
I was on the island.

611
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:54,199
You've been off the island for three years now.

612
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:57,099
You're safe now.

613
00:40:57,132 --> 00:41:00,099
It was just a dream.

614
00:41:00,132 --> 00:41:02,800
It wasn't a dream, pen.

615
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,999
It was a memory.

616
00:41:12,466 --> 00:41:15,633
Desmond, where are you going?

617
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:26,499
Des?

618
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,132
Desmond?

619
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,932
What are you doing?

620
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:34,166
We're leaving.

621
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:36,099
Leaving to go where?

622
00:41:40,032 --> 00:41:42,099
Oxford.
