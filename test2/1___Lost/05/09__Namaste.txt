1
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:28,376
Wanna hear something crazy?

2
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,007
What's that?

3
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:34,063
You've seen that big guy,
got on in LA,

4
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,766
first class,
curly hair, guitar case?

5
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:40,031
What about him?

6
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,855
He's one of the Oceanic 6.

7
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:44,112
He's got nerves of steel, man.

8
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,961
He survives a flight commercial airline
crash

9
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,411
and now he flies again over
the South Pacific?

10
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,839
Yeah, well, maybe he doesn't believe
that lightining will strike twice at the same places

11
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,134
Are you alright there, Frank?

12
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,206
I'm just fine.

13
00:01:20,608 --> 00:01:24,208
Dude, you'd wanna
fasten your seatbelt.

14
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,262
Oh, no...

15
00:01:29,062 --> 00:01:29,879
What?

16
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:41,877
Auto pilot off.
I got the controls.

17
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,157
Auto pilot off.
You have the controls.

18
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:10,372
We lost power.

19
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:14,218
Restarting 1.
Restarting 2.

20
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,579
Altimeter at 650.

21
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,796
Oh, my God!

22
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:23,786
Give me more power
To pull us out of this.

23
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,818
You're gonna rip us apart.

24
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:25,985
Do it!

25
00:02:29,481 --> 00:02:30,586
	
Come on!

26
00:02:41,556 --> 00:02:43,140
Is that a runway?

27
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,285
Bastartd board controls must been failure.
I'll put us down.

28
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,320
Mayday, mayday, this is Ajira 316!
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

29
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,520
4, 8, 15, 16...

30
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,188
All flaps, gear down,
speed 190.

31
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:58,246
Coming in too slick.

32
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:09,316
Reverse the thruster.

33
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:13,586
	
Come on!

34
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:15,930
We're running out.
We're running out.

35
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,174
Hold on.

36
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:19,587
Brace for impact.

37
00:03:56,156 --> 00:03:57,347
Hey, lady...

38
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,874
Are you ok?

39
00:03:59,082 --> 00:03:59,898
Jarrah?

40
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,586
No, my name is Caesar.

41
00:04:01,795 --> 00:04:03,106
We had an accident.

42
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:04,802
We're ok now.

43
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,409
Frank.

44
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,763
Sun.

45
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:26,234
you alright?

46
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:27,962
What happened?

47
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,050
I don't know.

48
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:36,274
Where is everybody else?

49
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,202
Jack, Kate, Hurley?

50
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:41,233
Where did they go?

51
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,903
They are gone.

52
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,584
Gone? Gone where?

53
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,761
How would I know?

54
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,952
Thirty years earlier

55
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,429
You're alive.

56
00:05:39,412 --> 00:05:41,965
Dude, I can't believe it.

57
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:47,571
Easy on the ribs there, Kong.

58
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:50,766
I missed that.

59
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:52,269
I missed you too, Hugo.

60
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:54,544
Sawyer.

61
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,815
Doc.

62
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,462
Good to see you, Kate.

63
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,886
You too, James.

64
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:21,326
You're really here.

65
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,822
The son of a bitch actually did it.
Locke said he was gonna bring you back.

66
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:28,797
Where is he?

67
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:35,101
John's dead.

68
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:40,256
Dead?

69
00:06:41,288 --> 00:06:42,407
How?

70
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,951
Doesn't matter. He's gone.

71
00:06:47,585 --> 00:06:50,265
So what's up with you guys
in old Dharma jump suits?

72
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,426
You didn't tell them?

73
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:57,280
No. I was waiting for you.

74
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,281
Tell us what?

75
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:07,329
We're in the Dharma initiative.

76
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:10,321
They came back to the island?

77
00:07:10,322 --> 00:07:11,322
No.

78
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,461
We came back.

79
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:16,558
And so did you.

80
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,620
It's 1977.

81
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,843
How? what?

82
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,300
Lost Season 5, Episode 9
Namaste

83
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:37,162
Created for Addic7ed.com 
by honeybunny, haunted 2423 & Alex28

84
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,138
Enjoy!

85
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:46,465
You're telling me you've been here
living with the Dharma Initiative

86
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,992
For the past 3 years?

87
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,129
That's right.

88
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,259
How long has it been for you
since the chopper?

89
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:55,041
Three years.

90
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:57,481
Hei, Jin. This is Miles.
Where are you?

91
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:01,296
If I don't report instantly,
they'll send out a patrol.

92
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:03,456
What should we do with them?

93
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,162
Dude, your English is awesome.

94
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:10,031
What we do, is bring them in.

95
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:11,565
Bring us in where?

96
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,118
Back to the barracks in Dharmaville.

97
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,414
You can't be wandering around
in the jungle with the hostiles.

98
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:16,947
The hostiles?

99
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:18,422
The others.

100
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,876
What about everybody else in the plane?
They can still be out there.

101
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,820
What do you mean everyone else?

102
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,954
We didn't come back alone.

103
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:28,291
Sayid was on the plane too... Lapidus.

104
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,333
And Sun.

105
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:34,740
Jin...

106
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:35,700
Hold on.

107
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:37,308
- Where are you going?
- To the Flame.

108
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:40,756
If the plane landed on the island,
Radzinsky would know.

109
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:42,212
Hold on, we gotta think
about that.

110
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:50,707
Alright. That's it.

111
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,986
Listen.
You guys have to stay put.

112
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,934
You don't go nowhere,
don't do nothing

113
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,292
until I figured it out how the hell 
I explain where you came from.

114
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,340
Sawyer, wait...

115
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,385
Other than you and Jin who else
is still here?

116
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:15,197
Miles, have you seen james?

117
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,493
No.

118
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,692
And he's not answearing his walkie.

119
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,412
Jin called him this morning

120
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:25,860
and then he just ran off, without 
telling me what was going on.

121
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,711
Well, let's see what we got.

122
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,458
Hang on.

123
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:37,377
There he is.

124
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:53,056
Have you seen my sweater 
with the bulldog on?

125
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,975
It's at the laundry.

126
00:09:55,296 --> 00:09:58,199
James? What's going on?

127
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,855
They're back.

128
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,711
I'm sorry, who's back?

129
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:06,733
Jack, Hurley, Kate.

130
00:10:08,957 --> 00:10:09,885
What?

131
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,850
I know.

132
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,801
They came back, Juliet.

133
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:18,975
Are they here now?

134
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,177
They're out
at the north point,

135
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,363
Waitin' for me
to tell 'em what to do.

136
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,338
How did they get...

137
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,046
I'm not sure. They said
they were on a plane.

138
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:43,621
I don't understand it
any more than you do.

139
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:46,132
But they're here,

140
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,550
and I gotta find a way
to bring 'em in

141
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,115
before somebody else finds 'em
and they screw up everything we got here.

142
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:59,975
There's, um, a sub
coming in this afternoon.

143
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:28,546
Hey, you understand
the concept of knocking?

144
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,063
Oh, get your hands off that!

145
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,676
I thought you learned English.
I said, hands off!

146
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:45,786
Nobody handles any of the gear
in this station except me.

147
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:46,601
Understand?

148
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,504
I need to check
the radar logs.

149
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,122
For what?

150
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:56,407
Please. I need to know if
a plane landed on the island.

151
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,065
If a plane landed? Here?

152
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,066
Yes.

153
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:04,327
What, so you think if
a plane landed on our island,

154
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,734
I'd be over there
just building my model?

155
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:10,045
That I wouldn't have called anyone?
That I wouldn't have put out an alert?

156
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:11,484
Maybe you missed it.

157
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:13,243
Can you
check with the other stations?

158
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:14,244
I <i>just</i> told you
I would not be--

159
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,687
Check with
the other stations.

160
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,700
Attention all stations, this is 
a system-wide broadcast from Radzinsky at the Flame.

161
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:38,795
I'm checking in to see if anyone's seen
an airplane over the island.

162
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,422
<i>No one else</i>
has seen an airplane,

163
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:44,997
but if you have, could you
call in to me, please? Over.

164
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,741
So what are you all
hot and bothered about, Kwon?

165
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,923
Why is this plane
so damn important?

166
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,218
It just is.

167
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,848
Did you lose someone?

168
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,329
Excuse me?

169
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:30,363
I just saw you looking around.
I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane.

170
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:31,746
No.

171
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,521
I was traveling alone.

172
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:36,522
Can I get
erybody's attention?!

173
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:40,882
Everybody, please!

174
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,338
Listen up, folks!

175
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,068
Here's where we're at.

176
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,700
The radio's dead,

177
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:54,315
so I haven't been able to call in 
our situation. But that's all right.

178
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:57,077
Soon as they figure out we're
not where we're supposed to be,

179
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:58,999
they'll come looking for us.

180
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:01,832
So best thing to do right now

181
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,944
stick together.

182
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:07,025
Stick together and just wait untill
help gets here.

183
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,026
Where's here?

184
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:09,027
What`s that?

185
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:12,224
Whre is "here"?
What is this place?

186
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,414
I don't know what "here" is because
this island is not on my charts.

187
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,406
Really?

188
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:20,936
Really.

189
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:24,555
Because there are some buildings over there.
Animal cages.

190
00:14:26,397 --> 00:14:29,940
Down from the beach, you can see another island
across the water.

191
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,482
So maybe you should look on some of your
charts.

192
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:37,229
Right now i`m just trying to keep everyone
here safe.

193
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,910
So let`s gather up some fire wood.

194
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:42,812
If he wants to wait, let him.

195
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,036
I say we search this buildings.

196
00:14:46,794 --> 00:14:48,140
Maybe they have a radio.

197
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,850
Or some food.

198
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:53,977
Who wants to help me?

199
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,409
Why are you following me?

200
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,931
Where you going?

201
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:39,572
Back to <i>our</i> island.

202
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,641
You wanna come?

203
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:56,996
Juliet...

204
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,556
Hey, Amy.

205
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:03,265
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

206
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,537
I just came to get
the sub manifest.

207
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,306
- Obviously, I don't want you working today.
- Thank you.

208
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,720
- Full load?
- Almost.

209
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:16,842
Two of the recruits dropped out
in the eleventh hour.

210
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:18,841
They didn't want to take
the sedative for the trip.

211
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,662
- Can you tell Pierre for me?

212
00:16:21,826 --> 00:16:27,763
Oh, hello, little one.

213
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,896
- Have you and Horace decided on a name?
- Yeah, we have.

214
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:35,942
We're gonna name him Ethan.

215
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,818
Oh, hey, buddy.

216
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:54,354
- So... When are you and Jim gonna have one of these?
- I don't know.

217
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,987
Timing's gotta be right.

218
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:11,576
So the woman who told you
how to come back...

219
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:14,025
did she mention that
it would be 30 years ago?

220
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,531
No. No,
she left that part out.

221
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,387
So what are we
supposed to do now?

222
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:27,817
I'm not sure yet.

223
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:30,687
Sawyer's back!

224
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:45,899
All right, listen.
Y'all are gonna be

225
00:17:45,997 --> 00:17:48,555
the second batch of recruits
comin' in off the sub

226
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:51,218
pullin' into port right about
now, so we ain't got much time.

227
00:17:51,662 --> 00:17:54,405
Nice suit, doc. Not exactly
island wear.

228
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,727
Try this.

229
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,043
You want us to say we came in on
the sub.

230
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,585
How's that gonna work?

231
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,475
Everyone gets knocked out
before the trip,

232
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:03,560
so no one meets each other
until we process 'em.

233
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:07,499
Look, we need to find the rest
of the people from the plane.

234
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,722
If there was a plane,
Jin will find it.

235
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,495
So we got about ten minutes
to make intake,

236
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:13,945
or y'all are gonna be camping
in the jungle for a <i>long</i> time.

237
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:16,431
There ain't another batch of
recruits due in for six months.

238
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:20,361
What do you think?

239
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,326
I think we should
listen to Sawyer.

240
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:24,740
- I vote for not camping.

241
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:28,320
Trust me. Do what I say.
Everything will be fine.

242
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,021
Let's move.

243
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:41,248
I just heard
from the Looking Glass.

244
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:45,436
They were the last station to check in.
They got nothing but an incoming sub.

245
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,721
Why don't you go home, and I'll
call you if something happens?

246
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,683
Move. <i>Move.</i> Out of my way.

247
00:18:58,282 --> 00:19:00,664
- Those bastards.
- What do you see?

248
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:03,319
Grid 325. Motion sensor alarm
was tripped.

249
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,891
We got a hostile
inside the perimeter.

250
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,449
Hey! Where you going?!

251
00:19:42,262 --> 00:19:43,426
Stop right there!

252
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:53,729
Sayid?

253
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:56,627
Jin!

254
00:19:58,694 --> 00:19:59,813
Where's Sun?

255
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,038
I don't know.

256
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,968
Shut up! 
Get down!

257
00:20:10,368 --> 00:20:12,702
Say another word,
and you're dead.

258
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:28,162
- Okay, so it's 1977.
- Yep.

259
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:31,996
And... you guys are all members
of the Dharma Initiative.

260
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,213
Yep.

261
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:39,613
Well, you <i>do</i> realize those dudes
get wiped out, right?

262
00:20:40,711 --> 00:20:42,955
I mean, I saw the pit
where all the bodies got dumped.

263
00:20:42,956 --> 00:20:44,939
- What about it?
- Well, aren't you gonna warn 'em?

264
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,296
Aren't you gonna
stop it from happening?

265
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,598
I ain't here to play Nostradamus
to these people.

266
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,928
Besides, Faraday's got
some interesting theories

267
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:54,113
on what we can
and can't do here.

268
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:56,326
Did you say Faraday?
He's here?

269
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,790
Not anymore. <i>...Recruits will be going inside for processing, <i>where you'll be given your work assignment and lodging.</i>

270
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:31,763
Put these on and listen up.

271
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,833
Juliet's got it worked out so your name's gonna
be on the list, all right?

272
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,399
So when you get in there, just watch the little
meet and greet video,

273
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,875
wait for 'em to call your name.

274
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:41,142
When they do, just smile, step up,

275
00:21:41,143 --> 00:21:42,925
take your jumpsuits and work assignments.
Work assignments?

276
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,187
Yeah, don't worry.
I got it covered.

277
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:46,322
Just remember to act a little doped up,

278
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:47,835
'cause you just woke up from the sub.

279
00:21:47,836 --> 00:21:49,288
What if they start asking us
questions we can't answer,

280
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:51,744
like, uh, who's president in 1977?

281
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,498
It's not a damn game show, Hugo.

282
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,286
Besides, I'm gonna be in there
to get your backs, all right?

283
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,364
Let's move.

284
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,131
LaFleur!

285
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,535
Where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you on the walkie.

286
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,853
What- what the hell are they doing here?
They're our new inductees.

287
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,397
I'll explain everything later.
Stop staring and tell me what your damn problem is.

288
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:36,992
It's, uh... It's Jin. 
There's a fourteen-J at the Flame.

289
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:38,615
What?

290
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:43,254
Jin, you there?
James, we have a problem.

291
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:46,746
We found a hostile.
What?! What do you mean you found a hostile? Where?

292
00:22:48,694 --> 00:22:52,144
He was wandering in the jungle.
Radzinksy's taking care of him now.

293
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:54,695
What's he doing in our territory?
It's a violation of the truce.

294
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,928
- It's Sayid.
- What?

295
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,592
Son of a bitch!

296
00:23:04,582 --> 00:23:07,385
- Was anyone else with him?
- No. He was alone.

297
00:23:19,655 --> 00:23:20,708
Wait!

298
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:24,488
I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't
interest me much right now.

299
00:23:24,489 --> 00:23:26,704
There are three outriggers
near here. I'm gonna take one.

300
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:32,225
So you can come along
and help me row...

301
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,720
or you can stay here. Frankly, it make
no difference to me.

302
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:37,965
- Why are you leaving?
- Why are <i>you</i> staying?

303
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:44,352
The main island...
is that where Jin is?

304
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:49,874
Honestly, I don't know. But that's where
I'd start looking.

305
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,319
Sun!

306
00:23:54,355 --> 00:23:55,597
Over here!

307
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:00,877
Hello, Frank.

308
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,172
You all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

309
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:08,149
I got worried
when I couldn't find you.

310
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,179
I saw him leaving.

311
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,098
What are you doing out here?

312
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:22,146
Ben knows where there's a boat.
I'm going back to the main island with him.

313
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:28,501
You don't think you can really
trust this guy, do you?

314
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:37,208
I have to trust him.

315
00:24:58,418 --> 00:25:00,237
- You ready?
- Yes.

316
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:04,730
Sun.  I want you to think about this,
okay? This guy is dangerous.

317
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,239
Sun, that boat I came here on...
It was filled with commandos

318
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:11,864
whose only mission
was to get him.

319
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,824
And how'd that work out
for everyone?

320
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,540
Don't do it.

321
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,680
Why don't you come with us?

322
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:25,040
I can't. I got a group of people
I gotta look after.

323
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:29,505
That's right, Frank. A captain's first 
responsibility is to his passengers.

324
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:32,878
But I have people
I have to take care of, too.

325
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,884
There's a small dock about a half mile 
due south across the water.

326
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,063
It leads directly to a town
where I used to live.

327
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:39,379
There are resources there.

328
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:43,052
So if anyone can help you and the rest 
of the plane get out of here safely, it--

329
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:56,573
- I thought you trusted this guy.
- I lied.

330
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,709
<i>Welcome to the island.</i>

331
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,623
<i>For your own comfort</i>
<i>and safety,</i>

332
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,092
<i>we ask that you stay within the confines</i>
<i>of your new living quarters.</i>

333
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:10,087
<i>Our barracks are surrounded</i>
<i>by a high frequency sonar fence</i>

334
00:26:10,466 --> 00:26:12,179
<i>to protect us from the island's</i>
<i>abundant and diverse wildlife.</i>

335
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:17,435
How are we gonna do this?

336
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:21,429
Shephard! Jack Shephard.

337
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:24,429
Here we go.

338
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:27,874
Hey, Jack.

339
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:33,170
Have a seat.

340
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,392
- Of course it isn't here.
- What's that?

341
00:26:36,497 --> 00:26:39,106
Your file. Could they be any more
disorganized on the other side?

342
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:45,224
Sorry. Namaste. I'm Pierre Chang.
Welcome to the Dharma Initiative.

343
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:48,270
- How was your ride in?
- It was fine.

344
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:51,325
Good. Who was
your shuttle driver?

345
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,083
- I'm sorry?
- The shuttle from the sub. Who was your driver?

346
00:26:56,634 --> 00:27:00,747
Oh, that was, uh...
Um...Mr. LaFleur.

347
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,575
Ah, yes. Good man, LaFleur.
Runs a very tight operation.

348
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:08,252
I'm sorry for the disorganization.

349
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,669
The woman who was supposed
to be processing you in had a baby last night.


350
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,499
I got pulled out of my lab. I...

351
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,714
Ah, here it is...

352
00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:18,695
Your job assignment.

353
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,810
- You've been assigned to the Shed.
- "Workman." What does--what does that mean?

354
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:30,970
Based on your aptitude test,
you'll be doing janitorial work.

355
00:27:40,357 --> 00:27:41,896
- Hey there, ma'am.
- Hi.

356
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,203
They haven't called you yet?

357
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:45,297
No. Not yet.

358
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:46,792
What's your name?

359
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,896
Kate... Austen.

360
00:27:49,954 --> 00:27:51,428
Austen...

361
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:04,816
You're not on my list, and you're not
on the sub manifest either.

362
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:06,188
Who's your recruiter?

363
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:13,602
Hold on, Phil. I just got
the new list from Amy.

364
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:18,610
Some, uh, last-minute additions,
including... Miss Austen?

365
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:27,032
All righty then.
She's all yours.

366
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:33,771
I'm sorry for the mix-up.
I'm Juliet.

367
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,296
- Kate.
- Hi, Kate. Welcome to the island.

368
00:28:57,591 --> 00:28:58,522
What the hell happened?

369
00:28:58,523 --> 00:29:01,438
Sayid just came walking out of
the jungle in handcuffs alone.

370
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,511
What?

371
00:29:02,553 --> 00:29:04,017
Did he say anything
about the plane they were on?

372
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,057
No, I couldn't talk to him.

373
00:29:05,058 --> 00:29:07,163
Radzinsky thinks he's a hostile.
He won't leave us alone.

374
00:29:09,603 --> 00:29:10,783
I got this.

375
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:16,961
- Where is he?
- Locked in the storage room.

376
00:29:16,966 --> 00:29:19,571
- Give me the key.
- You need to know, LaFleur--

377
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,457
He saw the model of the Swan,

378
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:24,394
and he could've seen the survey
of where we're building it.

379
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,155
- Your point is?
- He's a spy.

380
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:30,378
This whole thing is an act, and we either
play into it or we don't.

381
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:36,619
- We can end this right now.
- What the hell are you talking about, Radzinsky?

382
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:40,135
We shoot him.

383
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:48,112
Well, I appreciate your input there, quick draw.
But I wanna talk to him first.

384
00:29:48,113 --> 00:29:49,385
Give me the damn keys.

385
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,960
My name's LaFleur.
I'm head of security.

386
00:30:13,217 --> 00:30:16,115
I want you to listen real
carefully to what I got to say.

387
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:21,263
And if you do that,
you'll be fine. Understand?

388
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:28,661
All right, let's start simple.
Identify yourself as a hostile.

389
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:33,625
The terms of the truce say

390
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:37,891
you gotta identify yourself as a hostile, 
or we got the right to shoot you.

391
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:45,117
We do not refer to ourselves as "hostile,"
but yes, I- I am one of them.

392
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:52,481
All right. Good. Now we can proceed
like a couple of gentlemen.

393
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,074
All right, let's go. Just taking him back
to the barracks.

394
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,847
Oh, if you're taking him in,
then I'm coming with you.

395
00:30:57,885 --> 00:30:59,876
This is a horrible mistake.

396
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:02,316
I'm gonna talk directly
to Horace about this.

397
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:03,839
Fine. Talk away.

398
00:31:17,046 --> 00:31:19,209
You wanna remind me
why the hell we're doing this?

399
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,271
Ben said if my husband
is on the island,

400
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:24,760
the best place to start
looking for him is here.

401
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:28,523
Oh, I see, that's some advice you took
<i>before</i> you whacked him in the head.

402
00:31:56,678 --> 00:31:57,888
Whoa. Tell me you saw that.

403
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,194
Probably just an animal.

404
00:32:03,686 --> 00:32:05,423
Animal. Right.

405
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:26,259
I'm sorry to say, Sun,
but...

406
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:30,216
I don't think we're gonna
find your husband here.

407
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,265
Maybe we oughta
just head back.

408
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:04,651
Hello.

409
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,666
Who the hell are you?

410
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:09,225
My name's Christian.

411
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:17,125
I'm looking for my husband. His name 
is Jin Kwon. Do you know where he is?

412
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:22,042
Follow me.

413
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:41,459
What is this place?

414
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:47,263
- '72...'76, '78...
- Where is my husband?

415
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,370
Here we go. '77.

416
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:57,747
- He's, uh...He's with your friends.
- What are you talking about? What friends?

417
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:15,366
I'm sorry, but you have
a bit of a journey ahead of you.

418
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:26,418
Okay, ready?
Everybody say, "namaste!"

419
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:28,704
	
- Namaste!
- Nama-what?

420
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:33,409
Okay. Right on. So you guys have the rest of
the day to get acquainted with

421
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,499
your security protocol handbooks
waitin' in your new digs.

422
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,089
Now some of it may seem a little
scary, but I promise you all,

423
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,630
we are perfectly safe here, okay?

424
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:43,542
So make yourselves at home.
Come on. We got hamburgers. We got punch.

425
00:34:44,997 --> 00:34:47,641
You there, Phil?
We're coming in with a fourteen-J.

426
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:48,863
Roger that, Mr. LaFleur.

427
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:07,851
Okay, if I could get everyone to hold back, please,
we have a minor security situation.

428
00:35:14,394 --> 00:35:15,449
Move.

429
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,308
I guess we found Sayid.

430
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:51,026
All right, you can hang out here until we can 
figure out what the hell to do with you.

431
00:35:51,188 --> 00:35:52,462
What <i>are</i> we gonna do with him?

432
00:35:55,516 --> 00:35:58,144
Bring the man some damn food.
We're not savages.

433
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:17,021
Ah, excuse me.

434
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:20,393
Could you tell me
where James LaFleur lives?

435
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:24,668
- Uh, that's his house right there.
- Thanks.

436
00:36:27,574 --> 00:36:32,052
But I wouldn't call him "James."
He hates it.

437
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:02,286
Hey, Jack.

438
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:07,254
I saw you earlier today

439
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,215
when you were helping Kate, and I wanted 
to say something to you then, but...

440
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,111
- We're not supposed to know each other.
- Yeah.

441
00:37:20,184 --> 00:37:22,492
I was looking for Sawyer. 
I guess I came to the wrong house.

442
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,128
No. Come in.

443
00:37:31,314 --> 00:37:32,615
Evening, doc.

444
00:37:40,748 --> 00:37:42,915
Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about.

445
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,699
Take a load off.
You want a beer?

446
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:53,743
No.
No, I'm fine.

447
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:59,486
What can I do for you, Jack?

448
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,331
I don't even know
where to start. Uh...

449
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:12,060
- How about with Sayid?
- I had no choice.

450
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:15,102
He was running around in the jungle,
got caught by my people.

451
00:38:15,842 --> 00:38:18,646
And seein' as how he can't tell
the truth about how he got here,

452
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:20,532
- I had to improvise.
- Improvise?

453
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:27,550
And for now, Sayid is safe,
which is all that matters.

454
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:32,812
So where do we go from here?

455
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:34,595
I'm working on it.

456
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:37,097
Really? Because it looked to me
like you were reading a book.

457
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,386
I heard once Winston Churchill
read a book every night,

458
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:47,925
Even during the Blitz.
He said it made him think better.

459
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:53,380
It's how
I like to run things.

460
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,710
I'm sure that doesn't
mean that much to you,

461
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,306
'cause back when you were calling the shots,
you pretty much just reacted.

462
00:39:01,418 --> 00:39:03,189
See, you didn't think,
Jack,

463
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,326
and as I recall,
a lot of people ended up dead.

464
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:12,300
I got us off the island.

465
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,852
But here you are...Right back
where you started.

466
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:21,645
So I'm gonna go back to reading my book,
and I'm gonna <i>think,</i>

467
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:28,755
'cause that's how I saved your ass today.
And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow.

468
00:39:31,258 --> 00:39:34,064
All you gotta do is go home,
get a good night's rest.

469
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:35,751
All you gotta do is go home,
get a good night's rest.

470

Hey, Phil. I'm just gonna go in there
and deliver him a sandwich.

472
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:36,115
All right.

473

Hello.

474
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:55,288
I brought you a sandwich.

475
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:08,285
I didn't put mustard on it,
but if you'd like some, I could get some.

476
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:13,716
This will be fine.
Thank you.

Are you a hostile?

00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:21,861
Do you think I am?

479
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,278
What's your name?

480
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,193
Sayid.

481
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:32,585
What's yours?

482
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,340
I'm Ben.
