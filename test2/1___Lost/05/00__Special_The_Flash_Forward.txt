1
00:00:00,832 --> 00:00:03,000
Oceanic flight 815...

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:06,100
crashed in the South Pacific.

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,205
48 people survived...

4
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,604
- we're all in this together, man.

5
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:15,141
on a mysterious island...

6
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,510
- Jack!
far from home.

7
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:19,278
- You think they would've come by now.
They don't know where to look.

8
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:22,315
They fought for survival.
- This is our island.

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,317
And after 108 days...

10
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,185
- I'm one of the survivors
of flight 815.

11
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:29,488
...six people
- so we can go off the island?

12
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:30,990
...found rescue.

13
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,659
- Ladies and gentlemen-
the oceanic six.

14
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:36,529
But the friends
they left behind...

15
00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:38,597
vanished.

16
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:40,499
Now...

17
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,935
- Jin!

18
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:44,837
- No!
Destiny calls.

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,373
- Some very bad things happened.
- He wants us to come back.

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,776
And the six who came home

21
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,945
must find a way...
- we have to go back!

22
00:00:53,112 --> 00:00:56,449
...to return.
- The island needs you. You have to go back.

23
00:00:56,615 --> 00:01:01,020
LOST
DESTINY CALLS

24
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:04,857
The story of the survivors

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,859
of oceanic flight 815

26
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,695
has captured the imagination
of audiences around the globe.

27
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,865
And tonight, we explore
the many reasons why.

28
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,800
I think for us
as storytellers,

29
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,969
what's really exciting
about the show is,

30
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:19,538
when the audience is watching
it, they have this effect of,

31
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,707
"What's gonna happen next
on the show,

32
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:22,875
what are they gonna do?
How are they gonna surprise us?"

33
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,077
Well, you can watch
"Lost" and you can enjoy it.

34
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:26,312
You realize
there's a bunch of people,

35
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:27,546
they crashed on an island.

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,350
They're trying to survive
and make lives for themselves,

37
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,386
there's kind of
an elemental quality to it.

38
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,490
Ultimately, anybody could
crash on an island like this,

39
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,525
And the idea of being
surrounded by strangers

40
00:01:39,692 --> 00:01:41,494
And getting to
reinvent yourself in some way

41
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,596
is sort of
readily identifiable.

42
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,398
- I don't know your name.

43
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,565
- I'm Kate.

44
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:51,170
- Jack.

45
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,906
- Did anybody see that?
- Yeah.

46
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:58,844
The island is a mysterious
place. It is its own world.

47
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:03,082
- It's a polar bear.
We don't know where this island is.

48
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:07,353
We don't know how it is that they
can't be found. - Hey! We've got a bar!

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,089
Iteration 7-2-9...
what is that?

50
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,059
It's a distress call.

51
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:16,062
It's been playing
over and over for 16 years.

52
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:18,030
Maybe they came for them.

53
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:20,433
If someone came,
why's it still playing?

54
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,102
The island clearly has a larger
sort of spiritual quality to it.

55
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,104
We have
a mysterious smoke monster...

56
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,306
that comes and goes.
- Yeah, i saw it.

57
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:30,609
You might see someone
from your past that is dead.

58
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,446
Jack has seen his father
on the island...

59
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,949
- Dad?
Christian Shephard,who died in Australia.

60
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:40,252
- That's him. The reappearance
of dead characters on the show

61
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,254
kind of provide guidance
for our characters.

62
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,458
I'm not making any sense, am I ?
- No.

63
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,794
That's probably because
I've been dead for 12 years.

64
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,631
All these characters are
sort of seeking redemption...

65
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,433
- you're not here!
for misdeeds of their past.

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,136
I'm chasing something.
- You see him?

67
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:59,905
Yes. But he's not there.

68
00:03:00,072 --> 00:03:02,608
Last week,
most of us were strangers,

69
00:03:02,775 --> 00:03:05,277
but we're all here now,

70
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:08,147
and god knows
how long we're gonna be here.

71
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,483
Jack shephard is our hero.
He's a doctor.

72
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,785
He's kind of the guy
who most of the other castaways

73
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:14,987
have been looking to
kind of give them

74
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,589
leadership and guidance.

75
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:20,292
- If we can't live together,
we're gonna die alone.

76
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,595
He's not really
comfortable in this role.

77
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:25,598
I'm not a leader.  - And yet,
they all treat you like one.

78
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:28,134
He grew up with
th sort of tyrannical dad.

79
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,503
What'd I do wrong?  - Let's
hear it. You might wanna try

80
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,872
handing out some hope
every once in a while.

81
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,174
And as a result,

82
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,176
sort of second-guesses
himself often.

83
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,378
- You did a good thing.
You're taking care of everybody

84
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,681
and just giving us
something to count on.

85
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,517
The people on this island have
a second chance at their lives.

86
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,652
You could strip away
every aspect of your life.

87
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,788
If you're a lawyer
or you're a doctor,

88
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:51,023
Whatever you do
in the real world

89
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,360
Doesn't matter anymore on a desert
island. - I wanna tell you what i did.

90
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:55,962
I don't want to know.

91
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,197
It doesn't matter, Kate.

92
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,833
We should all be able
to start over.

93
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:02,868
Kate was a fugitive

94
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,305
who was apprehended in australia
by a U.S. marshal.

95
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:08,307
Don't run, Kate.

96
00:04:08,474 --> 00:04:11,243
So in terms of a character

97
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,279
who really got a chance
to start a life over,

98
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:16,582
it would be hard to top Kate in that
department. - Is Kate one of those fugitives

99
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,385
where she was framed for a crime
she didn't commit?

100
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:23,055
Katherine, what did you do?
- I took care of you, mom.

101
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,193
No. She actually blew up her dad... .

102
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,229
In a giant fireball.
- So there you go.

103
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,598
Why do you wanna go back Kate?
If you think there's anything

104
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:35,201
waiting for you back home
other than handcuffs,

105
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,070
then you really don't know how
the world works. - She is a person

106
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,607
who's used to running from problems
in her life. - I'm going back to the beach.

107
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:44,610
What, you're leavin'?
It's very hard for her to not revert

108
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,580
to being the person
that she was and just flee.

109
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:49,582
- In about a week,
you'll find some reason

110
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:52,952
to get pissed at Jack
and bounce right back to me.

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,023
She finds herself torn
between Jack, our doctor,

112
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,924
and Sawyer,
who's kind of the bad boy.

113
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:00,092
- Why are you sticking up
for Sawyer?

114
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,595
He'd never do it for you.
- Because I love you.

115
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:05,431
Jack is the guy
that she should be with,

116
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,400
and she does
genuinely love him.

117
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,535
And she knows that he would
take excellent care of her,

118
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,538
but Sawyer is the guy
that she's really drawn to.

119
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:16,542
Did you tell him about you
and me?  - No, but he knows.

120
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,778
He saw us on one of those
surveillance monitors.

121
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,946
Well, now that
that's out of the way,

122
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,516
how about a little
afternoon delight?

123
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:25,785
Come on, freckles, wait!

124
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,522
You need me to make you a mix
tape? - Yeah, why don't you do that?

125
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,025
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

126
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:36,629
Sawyer was a con man
before he got on flight 815.

127
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,698
Are you trying to con me?

128
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,400
And he's a con man on the island, too.
Yeah, he's a con man on the island.

129
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:44,036
There's a new sheriff in town,
boys!

130
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,272
Yeah.
And he's a rogue, a scalawag.

131
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,642
He's dangerous yet handsome yet charming.
He likes beer. He's like han solo.

132
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,778
He makes a lot of funny jokes. He calls people
nicknames. He has nicknames for everybody.

133
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,313
Hey there, sunshine.

134
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,116
What's your problem, jumbo tron?
Here comes dr. Giggles.

135
00:05:57,283 --> 00:05:59,151
Who are you getting your orders from,
colonel Kurtz? - He'd call you stripy...

136
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,153
'cause of that shirt
you're wearing.

137
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,122
He'd call you necktie.
Nice.

138
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,292
You do this back home too?
Steal from the dead?

139
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:09,228
You're just not lookin'
at the big picture, doc.

140
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:11,631
You're still back in
civilization. - And where are you?

141
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:14,100
I'm in the wild.
They're basically stuck here

142
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,169
And then they begin
to explore the island...

143
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,805
over here. And they discover that
there's some other mysterious people

144
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,808
who live on this island. - Have you
seen other people on this island?

145
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,644
No, but i hear them...

146
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,146
out there, in the jungle.

147
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:28,681
Sayid!

148
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,816
Listen to me.

149
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:33,085
We're not alone.

150
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:35,021
The show has
sort of a reputation

151
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,657
for being crazy and wacky
and weird and strange.

152
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,694
But 90% of our day is talking
about the people on the show-

153
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,196
what they would do,
how they would feel,

154
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,666
who's fighting with who,
who has a crush on who-

155
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:49,535
and that's the part of it
that's really fulfilling for us.

156
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,338
I think that the reason
people like these characters

157
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:56,108
is they see themselves in them.
- The show is about the same things that life is.

158
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,344
It's about love.
It's about forgiveness.

159
00:06:58,511 --> 00:07:01,847
It's about redemption.
It's about pain.

160
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:05,618
It's about excitement. - The idea
that they have a chance at redemption

161
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,220
Because of where they are
on this mysterious island,

162
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,357
that allows us to tell,
I think,

163
00:07:11,524 --> 00:07:14,393
fairly universal stories
about the human condition.

164
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,400
When John Locke
arrived on the island,

165
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:24,136
he finally found the place
where he truly belonged.

166
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:26,739
Mallomars.
- Wake up, Hugo.

167
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,208
Huh? Time to get up.
We're gonna get going.

168
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,578
I thought we didn't know where
we were going, dude. - We do now.

169
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,147
I run a school for kids

170
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:37,984
who are extremely special,

171
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,053
and i have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

172
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,556
John Locke's entire life
has been people telling him

173
00:07:43,723 --> 00:07:46,058
that he is special,
that he's meant for something.

174
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:48,728
But all that ever got him
was in a wheelchair,

175
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:52,765
in a dead-end job in a cubical.
- He was a guy who was really

176
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,901
at sort of the low nadir
in his life.

177
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:58,838
Aah! Aah! You survived falling
eight stories out of a building.

178
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:01,907
that's a miracle, mr. Locke.
Do you believe in miracles ?

179
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:06,512
Nope, i don't believe
in miracles.

180
00:08:09,015 --> 00:08:11,951
When he landed on this island,
he discovered he could walk.

181
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,720
You, come on! Get over here
and give me a hand!

182
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,956
Suddenly,
he's walking around,

183
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,191
And he's like, "this is what
everybody was talking about.

184
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,861
This is what i was meant for.
This is what makes me special."

185
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:24,964
What if everything
that happened here,

186
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:26,699
happened for a reason?

187
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,634
Locke basically believes,
"who needs science?"

188
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,203
You know, "who needs
a scientific explanation?"

189
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,738
It's destiny.

190
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,607
I don't believe in destiny.

191
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:36,942
Yes, you do.
You just don't know it yet.

192
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:38,944
The island is kind of like

193
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,946
the worst A.A. Meeting
you could possibly imagine,

194
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:44,450
'cause it forces you to relive
your past over and over again.

195
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:46,452
So if you were a torturer,

196
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:49,155
the island is gonna
present a situation for you

197
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,324
where you get to choose
whether or not

198
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,225
you're gonna torture again. - I served
five years in the republican guard.

199
00:08:53,392 --> 00:08:55,594
Just give me
ten minutes with him.

200
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,099
Sayid was a guy who has
tried on many occasions

201
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:02,134
to shed this very dark
sort of soul

202
00:09:02,301 --> 00:09:04,236
that he has inside
of himself.

203
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:07,740
Guess you're lucky you have
a new skill set you can use.

204
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:10,910
He is carrying the burden
of having tortured people,

205
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:13,145
and that is
a very heavy burden for him.

206
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,814
This isn't a game, Nadia.

207
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,849
Yet you keep playing it,
Sayid,

208
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,952
pretending to be something
i know you're not.

209
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,355
He escaped
his existence in Iraq

210
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,657
and was on a quest to find,
uh, this woman Nadia

211
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,293
who he lost track of.

212
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,462
I've been holding on
for the past seven years

213
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:31,497
to just a thought,

214
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:34,467
a blind hope, that somewhere
she is still alive.

215
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:37,703
Is he capable of transcending
the bad guy that he once was?

216
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,872
That's what makes him really
compelling as a character.

217
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,341
I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue.

218
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:44,377
I'm not giving it up
for nothing.

219
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,878
That idea of redemption

220
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:49,015
is really sort of the central
thematic of the show.

221
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:50,182
He's gonna be all right.

222
00:09:50,182 --> 00:09:54,854
Jack's gonna be all right. We
all are. - Well, what a relief.

223
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,125
In a lot of ways,
Hurley, I think,

224
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,360
is kind of the heart
and the soul of the show.

225
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,863
I mean, he's this guy who's
just trying to get along

226
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,398
and make his way here.

227
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,533
And Hurley, we discovered
in the first season,

228
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,868
won the lottery.

229
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:12,571
But this money made him utterly miserable.
I've kind of had some bad luck, too.

230
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,207
Grandpa Tito
died of a heart attack,

231
00:10:15,374 --> 00:10:17,877
and the first house
I bought my mom burnt down.

232
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:20,413
Going to Australia's
not gonna break any curse.

233
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,848
You need a little hope.

234
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,684
I have hope.

235
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,353
There is a Dharma bus
on the island.

236
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,222
He decides that
getting this car running

237
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:34,827
will really be a manifestation
of the possibility of hope.

238
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,829
Go!
Aah!

239
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:38,564
Son of a bitch.

240
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,266
The van
actually represents

241
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,300
a little more than just that

242
00:10:41,634 --> 00:10:45,104
because Hurley finds a dead
body in the van. - Bottoms up.

243
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,741
That's not cool, dude. That guy
had a mom... oh, and a name.

244
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,243
Not skeletor-
it's Roger Workman.

245
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,046
It's work man,
you blockhead!

246
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:55,414
He was a Dharma janitor.

247
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:57,350
I'm a janitor?

248
00:10:57,516 --> 00:11:01,253
I'm sorry, mr. Linus.

249
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,256
Now the Dharma
Initiative was on the island

250
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:07,026
Back in the '70s, early 80s.

251
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:10,096
I'm dr. Edgar Halliwax.
This is the orientation film...

252
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:11,030
What brought
the Dharma Initiative

253
00:11:11,063 --> 00:11:11,731
to the island,

254
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,634
it depends on whether or not you
believe these orientation films.

255
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,269
That our characters keep finding.
- For the briefest of the moments,

256
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,505
the animal
will seem to disappear.

257
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:24,644
All we really know about Dharma
is what we see in the films.

258
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,979
The Dharma Initiative says
that they came to the island

259
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,314
to kind of make the world
a better place.

260
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,383
But when you look a little
closer at these hatches...

261
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,185
it feels like they were
into psychological experiments.

262
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:36,188
Everyone of these hatches
is loaded with guns,

263
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,257
so they seemed to have been

264
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,826
a little bit more militaristic
than we originally surmised.

265
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,828
They set up their own
utopian society and they were

266
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,630
trying to carry out
these various experiments.

267
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:46,365
But then they discovered, oh,
there's these indigenous people

268
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:49,168
on the island called
the others, or the hostiles.

269
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:52,772
Okay, everyone into your
positions. - The so-called hostiles

270
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:55,474
lived on the island long before
the Dharma initiative.

271
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:57,677
And while they were
wary of outsiders,

272
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,313
they did make a few
exceptions. - Are you one of them?

273
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,516
One of who?
- A hostile.

274
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,785
Do you even know
what that word means?

275
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,487
Benjamin Linus has

276
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:11,457
a very sort of troubled history
with the island.

277
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:15,594
Hey! Welcome to the island, man!
Namaste. And this must be Ben. Yeah.

278
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,763
He was a member
of the Dharma Initiative.

279
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,599
He lived amongst these people
with his father.

280
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:23,436
Happy birthday, Ben.
Sorry I forgot.

281
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,506
It's kind of hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

282
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,674
Aah!

283
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:30,843
You had to come early.
Now she's gone,

284
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,748
And i'm stuck here
on this island... with you.

285
00:12:35,648 --> 00:12:37,083
And that led him

286
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,585
to become a fairly dark
and twisted individual...

287
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,621
Good-bye, dad. - Someone
dark and twisted enough

288
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:46,158
to basically kill his own father
in cold blood.

289
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,261
Ben is, in fact, complicit in
or potentially responsible

290
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:51,197
for the genocide
of all these people.

291
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:53,199
He killed
the Dharma Initiative.

292
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:57,003
Ben emerged from this incident
as the leader of the others.

293
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,839
You want us to, um,
go get his body?

294
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,875
No. Leave him out there.

295
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:07,146
And when oceanic 815
crashed on the island...

296
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,148
everything for Ben
was about to change,

297
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:13,352
Though he did everything
he could to maintain his power.

298
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,022
Goodwin! If you run, you can
make that shore in an hour.

299
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:17,857
Ethan, get up there
to that fuselage

300
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:19,992
there may actually
be survivors.

301
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,362
Listen, learn,
don't get involved. Go!

302
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:29,201
Whenever somebody else
comes to the island,

303
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:31,203
the others essentially,
sort of like hermit crabs,

304
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,506
wipe them out
and start to use their stuff.

305
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:35,541
So they have access
to satellites,

306
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,844
and they live in houses and have
little book club meetings

307
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,247
and this submarine that
used to go between the island

308
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:43,215
and back to the real world.

309
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:46,252
So they're able to sort of leave
the island at their own will

310
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,554
and they're very unhappy about
the fact that these survivors

311
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,056
landed on their island.

312
00:13:50,222 --> 00:13:52,258
There's an uneasy truce
that exists for a while.

313
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:56,095
This is our island, and the only
reason you're living on it

314
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:58,331
is 'cause we let you
live on it.

315
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,733
But there's also
hostility and conflict.

316
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,669
Aah! Ben is a bad guy,
and ben has basically

317
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,572
done a lot of horrible things
to further his own power.

318
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:10,343
You ever wonder what happened
to the Dharma Initiative, Hugo?

319
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,178
Whoa.

320
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:15,081
There must have been
at least a hundred of 'em

321
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:17,683
living on this island.
What happened to 'em?

322
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,187
He did.

323
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,759
Place we're taking you to
is special. Special, huh?

324
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:30,396
You'll see things there
that you never imagined.

325
00:14:29,128 --> 00:14:32,798
And one can only wonder
where it all began.

326
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:34,967
We know that the island's
been around for a long time

327
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,737
Because occasionally
we will stumble upon

328
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,740
The people who were here before.
- Our very own adam and eve.

329
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,342
We find a ship
in the middle of the jungle.

330
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:45,378
How it got there,
we don't know, but we know

331
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:49,782
That it's from the 19th century.
We saw this foot of a giant statue

332
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:51,851
That was by the water
on part of the island.

333
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:55,221
- It has four toes.
So the idea that there have been people

334
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:57,056
coming to this island
for many, many years-

335
00:14:57,223 --> 00:15:01,527
why has the island been drawing
people to it all this time? - We're here.

336
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,165
Juliet's a doctor
who lived in Miami

337
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,067
and she got recruited
by the others.

338
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,235
She thought
she was going to work

339
00:15:09,302 --> 00:15:12,305
for a pharmaceutical company
in Portland, Oregon,

340
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:15,207
but in fact, she woke up on the
island. - My name is Benjamin Linus.

341
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,877
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

342
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:19,445
Juliet was recruited
by the others

343
00:15:19,478 --> 00:15:21,247
because she was
a fertility expert

344
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,215
and one of the problems
that the others were having

345
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,151
is that they couldn't
have kids on this island.

346
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,286
I think it happens
at conception.

347
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,556
There's nothing i can do about it, at
least not here. Juliet, at a certain point,

348
00:15:29,822 --> 00:15:33,192
really becomes aware
that ben is manipulating her,

349
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,862
and all she wants is to to get off
this island. - That's not our agreement.

350
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,597
you need to stay here
until your work is finished.

351
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:41,834
It's impossible!
The most keep dying.

352
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:46,305
So Juliet left the others
to join the survivors,

353
00:15:46,772 --> 00:15:48,741
seeing them
as her best chance to get home.

354
00:15:48,908 --> 00:15:50,142
You want
to get off this island

355
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:52,878
more than anything else
in the world.

356
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:55,281
It makes you one of us.

357
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:58,084
I want to know
about your research.

358
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,786
Sun... - what happens to pregnant women?

359
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:02,588
They all die.

360
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,627
Sun and Jin are
from Korea. They're married.

361
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:09,762
And when we first meet them,
we assume that Jin

362
00:16:09,729 --> 00:16:11,497
is this sort of
domineering husband,

363
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,399
and she is
the submissive wife.

364
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:16,202
But as time goes by, we realize
that sun was having an affair.

365
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:20,006
She's pregnant, and she doesn't
know, uh, if the baby is

366
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:22,742
her husband's or this guy that
she was having the affair with.

367
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:25,778
The baby was conceived
about eight weeks ago.

368
00:16:25,945 --> 00:16:27,880
You got pregnant
on the island.

369
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,284
It's Jin's.

370
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,853
She comes to find out
that it was jin's,

371
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,091
and she eventually comes clean.
She tells him everything.

372
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:48,801
While many wanted
to leave the island,

373
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:51,570
One survivor
had reason to stay.

374
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:54,940
Don't mind them. They're all
just excited you're here.

375
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:56,075
Excited?

376
00:16:56,242 --> 00:16:58,110
We've been waiting for you.

377
00:16:58,277 --> 00:17:01,547
Locke is really now on
a mission to try to understand

378
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:04,817
the mysteries of this island.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?

379
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,485
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

380
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,853
you just never
get tired of this view.

381
00:17:07,887 --> 00:17:10,990
We haven't been formerly
introduced. I'm Richard.

382
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,161
Richard Alpert is
the guy behind the guy.

383
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,897
He is an other,
a very mysterious figure,

384
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:20,266
and we have seen him
in sort of an advisory role.

385
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,767
There's 40 of them.

386
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:24,303
What do you think's gonna happen
when you get there?

387
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,839
We saw him visit John Locke
when he was a very little kid.

388
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:29,141
The thing about alpert is that
he always looks the same

389
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:31,577
In all the different time
periods that we've seen him.

390
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:32,912
When word
had gotten back here

391
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,448
that there was a man with
a broken spine on the plane

392
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,350
who could suddenly
walk again,

393
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,353
well, people here began
to get very excited because that

394
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:43,756
could only happen to someone
who was extremely special.

395
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:47,193
John Locke seems to be the guy
that the island wants

396
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,462
to be leading. We're looking
for someone to remind us

397
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:52,031
that we're here
for more important reasons.

398
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:54,667
But Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

399
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:57,436
Ben is told that Locke
is going to be replacing him

400
00:17:57,603 --> 00:18:01,807
as the leader of the island, and Ben is not
happy about this. - You'll understand soon enough

401
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:04,110
that there are consequences
to being chosen...

402
00:18:04,277 --> 00:18:05,678
because destiny, John,

403
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,015
is a fickle bitch.

404
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:12,518
With Ben now replaced,
Locke's mission as leader

405
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:15,521
was to protect the island at
all costs. Locke has basically

406
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:18,624
destroyed two ways
in which our survivors

407
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,127
might get themselves
liberated from this island.

408
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:23,863
He blows up
one of the Dharma Stations

409
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,898
which is
a communication station.

410
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,701
And then he blows up
the submarine,

411
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:31,737
which is their best chance of getting
off the island. - I'm sorry, Jack.

412
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:35,041
Just when it seemed
all hope for rescue was lost,

413
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,376
the survivors learned
a group on a nearby freighter

414
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,345
were trying
to reach the island.

415
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,914
Is that like a radio?
- Yes.

416
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:44,216
I've never seen equipment
this sophisticated.

417
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:47,053
You can still make it
work, right? I hope so.

418
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,255
With rescue
finally a possibility,

419
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:51,991
Locke once again tried
to prevent anyone from leaving.

420
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:54,827
What are you doing, John?

421
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:57,830
- Put the phone down
Jack is the optimist.

422
00:18:57,997 --> 00:19:00,232
He goes, "oh, here's our chance.
We're gonna get off the island."

423
00:19:00,399 --> 00:19:03,869
You're done keeping me
on this island.

424
00:19:04,036 --> 00:19:06,072
You're not supposed
to do this.

425
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,441
Minkowski.

426
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:10,009
Hello?

427
00:19:10,176 --> 00:19:11,711
Who is this?

428
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:17,350
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

429
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:19,518
Can you get a fix
on our location?

430
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,187
Hell, yeah, we can!

431
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:22,555
Sit tight.

432
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:24,626
We'll be right there.

433
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,134
Oh!

434
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:36,436
You all right, brother?
Ah! I'm fine.

435
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,538
Does this hurt?

436
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:41,475
You haven't sprained it then. What
do you know about sprains anyway?

437
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:44,945
I was almost a doctor once.
Small world.

438
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:46,780
Among the oceanic survivors,

439
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:49,783
the degrees of separation
are few.

440
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,752
There have been
a lot of connections

441
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,221
between the characters as time
has gone by, some of which

442
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:56,290
they're aware of and some
of which they aren't aware of.

443
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,659
But all their paths
have sort of crossed

444
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:01,995
in these strange and mysterious ways.
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

445
00:20:02,162 --> 00:20:06,133
He conned me and embarrassed me.
He was a bad guy.

446
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,568
Some people are just
supposed to suffer.

447
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:10,570
That's why the red sox-
will never win the series.

448
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:14,007
What the hell is that supposed to
mean? - Something my father used to say.

449
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:16,476
There is this sort of
weave of life in that

450
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:19,646
These aracters that are
brought together on this island

451
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,682
all are linked
to each other.

452
00:20:21,848 --> 00:20:23,517
I'm Desmond.

453
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:24,952
Jack.

454
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,020
Well, good luck, brother.

455
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,756
See you in another life,
yeah?

456
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:32,125
Desmond shipwrecked
on this island

457
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,127
while he was attempting
to sail around the world

458
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:37,531
To kind of try to prove
his heroism to Penny Widmore,

459
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:40,167
the woman that he loves.

460
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:42,336
Desmond,
what are you running from?

461
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,338
I have to get my honor back.

462
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,473
Penny widmore's father,
Charles Widmore,

463
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,442
Is this very powerful
and imposing figure,

464
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,611
and he doesn't
like Desmond at all.

465
00:20:50,777 --> 00:20:53,013
And what makes you think
I would just run away?

466
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,982
Because you're a coward.

467
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:59,219
I'm gonna win this race, Penny.
His race.

468
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:01,822
And in a year, I'll be back.

469
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,324
The net result of being
shipwrecked on this island

470
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:07,494
was that Desmond and Penny
have been separated,

471
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,464
and Penny was searching
for Desmond for a long time.

472
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:13,333
He spent
a significant amount of time

473
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,870
down in this hatch pushing this button.
And when the button isn't pushed,

474
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,705
cataclysmic events started
happening. - I've gotta go,

475
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:21,208
And you've gotta get as far
away from here as possible.

476
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:24,378
So Desmond crawled down
in that underground passage

477
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:27,547
and when he turns this
failsafe key, all of a sudden,

478
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:31,151
there's a white flash and there
was this incredibly weird noise.

479
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:34,154
Obviously, there was
some consequence of that.

480
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,657
one consequence appears to be
that the island was made visible

481
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:39,559
to the outside world.

482
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:42,596
Hello? - Miss Widmore?
I think we found it.

483
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,765
Des, where are you?!

484
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,700
My god, penny.
Is that really you?

485
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,335
Yes, it's me.

486
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:49,903
I love you, Penny.

487
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,172
I've always loved you.

488
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:54,708
I'll find you, Des.
I'll come back to you.

489
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,510
I won't give up.
I promise.

490
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:58,845
I promise. I love you.
I love you.

491
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,048
The power source went dead.

492
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:02,449
Th's all we have.

493
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:05,419
For reasons that we don't quite
know, the island is invisible.

494
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:07,454
If you fly over it,
you can't see it.

495
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:09,589
You know, uh, satellites
can't take pictures of it.

496
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:11,591
So it's very difficult
to find.

497
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:15,028
And then, essentially, this
freighter shows up. The freighter

498
00:22:15,195 --> 00:22:18,365
Sent a research team
by helicopter to the island,

499
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:22,703
where they were discovered
by the survivors.

500
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:25,539
Who are you?
- I'm here to rescue you.

501
00:22:25,706 --> 00:22:28,041
Jack was hoping
that the freighter people

502
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,443
Really were as promised,

503
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,378
and so he basically
saw the freighter

504
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:35,282
as a way for our guys to get off
the island. - Are we really going home?

505
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,618
Yeah,
we're really going home.

506
00:22:37,784 --> 00:22:39,886
And Locke is actually
the pessimist.

507
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:42,122
He goes, "unh-Unh, these peoe
are gonna kill us.

508
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:45,258
They're gonna wipe us out. - If you
wanna live, you need to come with me.

509
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:49,830
No one's going anywhere
with you, John.

510
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:53,967
What are you doing?

511
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:57,771
Same thing
i've always done, Kate.

512
00:22:57,938 --> 00:22:59,273
Survivin'.

513
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:02,943
You should
go with him, Kate.

514
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,514
You serious?
- I don't trust Locke.

515
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,419
Can you get Aaron for me?

516
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:16,189
Yeah, i'm just...
not very good with babies.

517
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:18,358
Ohh.

518
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:20,661
You're so good with him.

519
00:23:20,827 --> 00:23:24,431
The last thing i ever thought
i'd be good at is being a mom.

520
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:27,501
You know, you should
try it sometime.

521
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,640
Claire Littleton
was eight months pregnant

522
00:23:33,807 --> 00:23:35,175
When the plane crashed

523
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:38,345
and shortly thereafter
gave birth to her son Aaron.

524
00:23:38,512 --> 00:23:40,547
You have a little boy!
Oh!

525
00:23:40,714 --> 00:23:43,016
In her sort of
younger rebellious days,

526
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,285
she was in this rather bad
car accident,

527
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,788
and Claire's mother ended up
in a vegetative state.

528
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:50,257
As a result of that event,
Claire finds out

529
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,895
Who her real father is. - I came
over because i wanted to help.

530
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:57,564
And we the audience
realize this man is in fact

531
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,067
Christian Shephard, who also
happens to be Jack's father.

532
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:04,204
I don't even know your name.
I want it to stay that way.

533
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,640
And now, essentially,
Claire's missing.

534
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:07,908
We don't know where she is.

535
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,944
She saw Christian Shephard
in the jungle. - Dad?

536
00:24:11,345 --> 00:24:14,047
She left the baby behind,
and that's it.

537
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:16,149
Where's Claire?

538
00:24:16,316 --> 00:24:18,719
We lost her.
You what?

539
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:23,323
She just walked off
in the middle of the night.

540
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:26,328
Are you okay?

541
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:28,864
Lapidus, where's the chopper?
Where did it crash?

542
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:33,969
Crash? I put her down
safe and sound right over there.

543
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:37,072
The team from the freighter
and their helicopter

544
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,074
landed safely on the island,

545
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:41,043
leaving Jack
and his fellow survivors

546
00:24:41,209 --> 00:24:43,345
To believe they were
one step closer to rescue.

547
00:24:43,512 --> 00:24:46,014
There are two types
of people on the freighter.

548
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,483
There's scientists
and then there's military guys.

549
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,385
And the scientists
are sort of represented

550
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:51,920
by this guy Dan Faraday,

551
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:53,655
a woman named Charlotte Lewis

552
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,490
and then a guy
named Miles Straume,

553
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,125
and they come first.
- What's this for?

554
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:59,461
Rescuing you
and your people-

555
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:02,965
Can't really say
it's our primary objective.

556
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:05,367
And they're sort of interested
in doing experiments,

557
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:07,169
Figuring things out
about the island.

558
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,805
In the meantime, the military
guys are sort of moving in

559
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:11,139
With their guns
and their explosives...

560
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:13,909
and they are trying to get
Benjamin Linus off the island.

561
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:16,311
Get your ass out here
right now,

562
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:19,414
Or i'm gonna kill your daughter.
I'm not coming out of this house.

563
00:25:20,716 --> 00:25:22,384
so if you want to kill her,
go ahead and do it.

564
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,889
And their mission is not
only to take out Benjamin Linus,

565
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:29,424
but to take out everybody else
who's on the island.

566
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:32,261
I can help you, John,
we have shared interests.

567
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:35,364
Or, at least, a common enemy. - And that
would be our friends on the freighter.

568
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,500
Not them,
the one they work for.

569
00:25:40,135 --> 00:25:41,737
This is Charles Widmore,

570
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:44,306
The man whose boat
is parked offshore.

571
00:25:44,473 --> 00:25:46,108
What does he want?

572
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:48,277
Charles Widmore
wants to exploit this island,

573
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:51,246
And he'll do everything
in his power to possess it.

574
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,382
This guy Charles Widmore
looms out there,

575
00:25:53,548 --> 00:25:55,083
and what exactly
his relationship is

576
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:56,952
with this island,
we don't know.

577
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,754
We know that he has
a daughter named Penny,

578
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,689
the long-Lost love
of our character Desmond.

579
00:26:01,657 --> 00:26:05,894
The wreckage of oceanic flight 815 has
been found. There is this sort of wrinkle.

580
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:08,664
Oceanic 815
supposedly was discovered

581
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:11,099
on the bottom of the ocean,
and everybody aboard was dead,

582
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,134
which is not the truth

583
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,902
because their plane
crashed on the island.

584
00:26:13,936 --> 00:26:15,938
Wow, who could possibly
be responsible

585
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:20,442
for staging a conspiracy of this
magnitude? Ben basically says

586
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,144
It was Widmore.
- He wanted everyone to think

587
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:24,980
you guys were dead so no one
would ever find the island

588
00:26:25,147 --> 00:26:27,115
and he could find it
for his own purposes.

589
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:29,818
And widmore says,
- Benjamin Linus is responsible

590
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:34,022
for putting the plane there, for exactly
the same reasons. - I know who youre, boy.

591
00:26:34,056 --> 00:26:38,060
Everything you have, you took
from me. - I'm here, Charles,

592
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:41,029
to tell you that i'm going
to kill your daughter.

593
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,931
You'll never find her.

594
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:45,801
That island's mine, Benjamin.

595
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:50,272
It always was. It will be again.
This scenario is really bad

596
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:52,341
because this freighter
has found the island,

597
00:26:52,507 --> 00:26:54,443
and the others have been trying
to protect the island

598
00:26:54,476 --> 00:26:56,878
all this time.
Locke has basically been told

599
00:26:56,912 --> 00:27:00,182
that he is now the chief
of the others. Welcome home.

600
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,117
He's finally,
after all this time,

601
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,119
ascended to
a leadership position.

602
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,955
So the fact that Widmore
now knows where the island is

603
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:09,391
creates this problem for them,
which is, even if they're able

604
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:11,360
to get rid of the people
on the boat,

605
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:13,061
they still have to make sure

606
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:16,632
that the island can't be found
again. Locke and Ben were determined

607
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:18,734
to secure the safety
of the island,

608
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,702
so they journeyed to a place
deep in the jungle

609
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:25,307
to find answers.
- Hi, john.

610
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,309
Claire?

611
00:27:27,476 --> 00:27:30,579
Don't worry. I'm fine.
I'm with him.

612
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:32,648
I'm Christian.

613
00:27:32,814 --> 00:27:34,683
You know why i'm here?

614
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,518
Yeah. Do you?

615
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:39,054
Because i was chosen to be.

616
00:27:39,221 --> 00:27:41,556
That's absolutely right.

617
00:27:41,723 --> 00:27:44,760
How do i save the island?

618
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:48,163
Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

619
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,732
He wants us
to move the island.

620
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:54,202
Well, if you can move
the island, why didn't you just

621
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:56,605
move it before those psychos
with guns got here?

622
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,740
It's a measure of last resort.
- Awesome.

623
00:27:58,907 --> 00:28:01,276
Hey, Sayid. Listen.

624
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:03,612
We need to get these people
off this island.

625
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:08,183
I can start ferrying people now. A window
of opportunity opened, and the science team

626
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,252
began shuttling survivors
to the freighter.

627
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,455
And in the jungle, Ben lured
the mercenary team into a trap.

628
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:16,425
We know
that ben is a bad guy

629
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:18,760
because this boat full
of even worse guys-

630
00:28:18,927 --> 00:28:21,730
they're trying to get him.
- I believe you're looking for me?

631
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:24,766
You send, like, 15 armed guys just to
get this little guy. To extract him.

632
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:29,371
Yeah. Yeah, but they're unsuccessful.

633
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,611
Thank you for coming,
Richard.

634
00:28:35,777 --> 00:28:37,045
He kills 'em all.
Yeah.

635
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:39,715
What was the arrangement?
- They, uh, help us free you,

636
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:44,119
And we let 'em off the island. Fair
enough. The helicopter is yours.

637
00:28:44,286 --> 00:28:46,088
You have
a safe journey back.

638
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:48,657
So we can go...
off the island?

639
00:28:48,824 --> 00:28:50,425
That's it?

640
00:28:50,592 --> 00:28:52,761
That's it.

641
00:28:52,928 --> 00:28:55,230
But before they could leave,

642
00:28:55,397 --> 00:28:57,799
Jack and Locke
had unfinished business.

643
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:01,003
You're not supposed to go home.
- Then what am i supposed to do?

644
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:03,438
Locke says, "jack, don't go.
This is our purpose.

645
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,975
It's our reason. It's our destiny," you know?
And he says, "you're nutty. You're crazy.

646
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,978
You've got a screw loose."
Good-Bye, john.

647
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,814
You're gonna have to lie.

648
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,917
Excuse me?

649
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,852
If you have to go,

650
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:18,820
Then you have to lie
about everything.

651
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:21,023
It's the only way
to protect it.

652
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:23,992
It's an island, John.
No one needs to protect it.

653
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,861
It's not an island.

654
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:28,664
It's a p lace
where miracles happen.

655
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,667
There's no such thing
as miracles.

656
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,337
Just wait till you see
what i'm about to do.

657
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:38,106
Locke and Ben descended
deep below a Dharma Station

658
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:41,009
called the orchid.

659
00:29:41,176 --> 00:29:43,712
And underneath the orchid
is this mysterious wheel,

660
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:46,348
And if you turn that wheel,
that will actually

661
00:29:46,515 --> 00:29:48,183
cause the island to move
in space-time.

662
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,788
Sayid! Kate!
It's good to see you, dude.

663
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:56,892
Are you okay?
- I am now.

664
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,161
Let's go, freckles.

665
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:03,165
I've seen enough
of this rock.

666
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:06,301
The moment they had hoped for
finally arrived.

667
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:08,971
Let's go for a ride!

668
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:11,406
They were going home.

669
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:13,976
But before the survivors
reached the freighter,

670
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:16,078
they were met
with yet another obstacle.

671
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,980
There is this moment
in the helicopter

672
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:20,082
when they're heading
for the freighter

673
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:22,351
the chopper is running out
of gas. It's not gonna

674
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:24,519
make it safely to the boat.
- I'd feel a hell of a lot better

675
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:26,521
if we were a few hundred
pounds lighter! - Hey!

676
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:28,557
Sawyer leans over,
he whispers

677
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,226
in Kate's ear something-
we don't hear what it is.

678
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,528
and just before she realizes
what he's gonna do,

679
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:35,230
he jumps out.
- Sawyer!

680
00:30:36,598 --> 00:30:38,934
And that's how
he gets left behind.

681
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:39,968
And ever since that moment,

682
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,004
Jack has wondered,
what did he say to her?

683
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:46,508
Sawyer's leap allowed his
friends to reach the freighter.

684
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:49,011
But when they arrived,
they quickly learned

685
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:52,114
the mercenary team
rigged the boat with explosives

686
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:55,684
that were about to blow.

687
00:30:55,851 --> 00:31:00,255
It's Jin!

688
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:08,363
Jin!

689
00:31:09,531 --> 00:31:12,801
What are you doing here?
- Decided to take a dip.

690
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,436
What you celebratin'?

691
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:16,405
I'm not celebrating.

692
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:19,408
The thing about Sawyer jumping
is it kind of backfires.

693
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:22,210
Is that our boat?
- It was.

694
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:24,146
Jumping off
the chopper might just have led

695
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:27,616
to him saving his own life,
but he now thinks that Jack

696
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:31,587
and Kate and Hurley and Sayid and Desmond
and the baby... they could all be dead.

697
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,123
Could all be completely dead.
Yeah. The helicopter turns around,

698
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,260
now starts flying towards the
island...  - yeah, what is that?

699
00:31:38,427 --> 00:31:43,565
And then all of a sudden,
there's a giant white flash...

700
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,834
and the island disappears.

701
00:31:46,001 --> 00:31:49,471
And all that's left are a couple
of ring waves on the water.

702
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:51,974
Now you have this helicopter
just flying around

703
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,276
in the middle of the ocean
with no place to land,

704
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:57,913
and the helicopter
crashes into the water.

705
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,583
Get the baby.

706
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,118
Jack? Where's Desmond?

707
00:32:03,518 --> 00:32:05,654
Get the baby.
- I got him.

708
00:32:05,821 --> 00:32:07,522
And they're screwed. They're out
in the middle of the water.

709
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:10,592
There's no way that anyone's
ever gonna find them.

710
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,294
Long and behold,
there's this boat.

711
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:15,664
God almighty.
There's a boat out there!

712
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,501
Hey!

713
00:32:19,668 --> 00:32:22,671
We're gonna have to lie.
- Lie about what?

714
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,507
Every moment since we crashed
on the island.

715
00:32:25,674 --> 00:32:27,409
You said that our plane
was discovered

716
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:29,278
on the bottom of the ocean.
Well, someone put it there-

717
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:31,446
someone who wants everyone
to think that we're dead.

718
00:32:32,214 --> 00:32:33,448
So what do you think's
gonna happen to us

719
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,317
when we tell them that
that wasn't our plane?

720
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:41,523
What do you think's gonna happen to the people
we left behind? - Jack, we can't pull it off.

721
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,126
Just let me do the talking.

722
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,094
Ms. Widmore!

723
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:50,365
Throw them a rope! Take them
'round to the stern! - Penny?

724
00:32:50,532 --> 00:32:54,970
- Penny!

725
00:33:01,743 --> 00:33:06,415
I love you, Penny,
and i'll never leave you again.

726
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:12,588
This is Penny. This is
Kate and-And Aaron. - Hi.

727
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:15,891
And jack. Jack, this is Penny.
It's nice to meet you, Penny.

728
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:17,326
Hi.

729
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:21,897
But we need to talk.

730
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,604
Why are we doing this, dude?

731
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:30,906
Because it's the only way
to keep them safe.

732
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:33,075
To protect the friends
they left behind,

733
00:33:33,242 --> 00:33:35,244
the survivors agreed to lie.

734
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,114
You sure about this,
brother? Are you sure?

735
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,583
As long as i've got Penny,
i'll be fine.

736
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,621
Then i'll see you in
another life, brother. Bye.

737
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:47,689
And so began
their long journey home,

738
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:50,192
where the life
that awaited them

739
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,227
was not what they'd hoped for.

740
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:54,930
Six of them came back
to civilization.

741
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,299
They are Jack, Kate, Hurley,

742
00:33:57,466 --> 00:34:01,036
Sayid, Sun and baby Aaron.

743
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:03,639
These people who will be known
as the "oceanic six"

744
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:06,675
decide to lie. - We were in
the water for over a day

745
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,877
before the current took us in.
By then,

746
00:34:09,044 --> 00:34:10,545
there was only eight of us left.

747
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:12,047
They wanna
protect everybody

748
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,149
that was left on the island.
So they go along with this lie,

749
00:34:14,283 --> 00:34:17,486
and this becomes a part of their
cover story. - Is it possible there are

750
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,056
any other survivors from the crash
yet to be discoved? - No. Absolutely not.

751
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,493
They quickly discover that
they really didn't have much

752
00:34:24,526 --> 00:34:25,961
in the way of lives
back in the real world.

753
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:27,496
There was this sort of
gnawing feeling

754
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:28,463
that maybe
they made a mistake,

755
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:30,832
maybe they shouldn't have left
the island in the first place.

756
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,769
Hey, how's everybody doing?
What are you talking about?

757
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:38,173
Building a fire or hunting
boars? - They have survivors' guilt,

758
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,276
And that makes them pretty
miserable. - She looks just like Jin.

759
00:34:41,443 --> 00:34:43,745
Yes, she does.

760
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,249
Sun's in kind of
a tragic place

761
00:34:47,316 --> 00:34:48,917
because she's back
in the real world,

762
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:50,185
and she's kind of living in
with the tragedy of believing

763
00:34:50,352 --> 00:34:52,588
That her husband died
in this freighter explosion.

764
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:56,258
She has a daughter,
and she's not really that able

765
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:59,595
to move on with her life because
she's so distraught and angry

766
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:01,697
over the circumstances
of his death.

767
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:06,835
The last time we saw her,

768
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:08,870
she was actually having
this sort of secret meeting

769
00:35:09,037 --> 00:35:11,473
with Charles Widmore, who,
last we checked, was a bad guy.

770
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,841
You and I have
common interests.

771
00:35:13,008 --> 00:35:16,545
When you're ready
to discuss them, call me.

772
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:19,414
As you know, we're not the only
ones who left the island.

773
00:35:19,448 --> 00:35:21,717
We know the only other person
who's left the island,

774
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:26,121
and that's Benjamin Linus via
sort of unconventional means.

775
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,156
He basically
pushes this wheel underground

776
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:29,825
in a cavern somewhere.

777
00:35:29,992 --> 00:35:31,693
He gets bathed in light,
and then suddenly he wakes up

778
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:33,729
the desert in Tunisia
in the middle of nowhere.

779
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,035
I just want
to bury my wife in peace.

780
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:44,039
Mr. Jarrah?

781
00:35:44,072 --> 00:35:45,374
There's a woman outside.
She says she knows you,

782
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,409
But she wasn't on
the list of family members.

783
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:51,380
When the oceanic six are finally
rescued and discovered,

784
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:53,682
the love of his life,
this woman named Nadia,

785
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:55,350
is there to greet Sayid.

786
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:56,385
And they finally get to pick up
where they left off,

787
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:58,687
and they're married.

788
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:01,256
Unfortunately, this marriage
does not last long

789
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,091
because nadia dies
in an accident.

790
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:06,228
Benjamin Linus comes to Sayid
and tells him,

791
00:36:06,261 --> 00:36:09,264
"This was no accident.
Your wife was murdered."

792
00:36:08,397 --> 00:36:10,999
Why would these people
want to murder her?

793
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,935
And he gives Sayid
a list of names,

794
00:36:13,101 --> 00:36:15,704
sort of this vast consortium
of men

795
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,773
who might or might not
work for Charles Widmore.

796
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,741
Since that time,

797
00:36:19,908 --> 00:36:22,077
Sayid has spent all of his time
exacting vengeance

798
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:25,447
by killing anybody who
Benjamin Linus tells him to.

799
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,517
I have another name for you.

800
00:36:28,684 --> 00:36:31,019
Who's next?
That's acting out.

801
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:33,922
That's what i would do if i were
feeling guilty.- I just killed a man

802
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:36,425
who's been perched outside
this facility for the last week.

803
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:40,095
I want you to come with me.
- We're not going back, are we

804
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:42,531
No, just somewhere safe.

805
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,902
I don't think
we did the right thing, Jack.

806
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:49,037
I think it wants us
to come back. Hurley...

807
00:36:48,303 --> 00:36:51,240
and it's gonna do everythingt can
- We're never going back!

808
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:53,642
There's a strong
moral streak in Hurley.

809
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,310
He's not really
very comfortable

810
00:36:55,477 --> 00:36:57,379
with the idea that
they are telling this lie

811
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,548
and they've left these other
people behind on the island.

812
00:36:59,715 --> 00:37:01,884
And since he's gotten
off the island,

813
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,386
he starts to see dead people.
- Help!

814
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:07,055
What the hell
is wrong with you?

815
00:37:07,222 --> 00:37:09,258
And this makes Hurley, uh,
basically freak out

816
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:11,727
and he gets himself
thrown into the nuthouse

817
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:13,729
In order to avoid that.

818
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,398
I've been having regular
conversations with dead people.

819
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:18,467
The last thing i need now
is paranoia.

820
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,402
Don't move!

821
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:23,906
I
- Just don't bring him back, Kate.

822
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:28,477
Don't you dare bring him back!

823
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,348
Kate comes back
to civilization,

824
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:36,018
And she tries on the role
of bel a responsible person.

825
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,319
She's got this kid, Aaron,

826
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:39,288
who she's telling everyone
is her child

827
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:41,323
but, in fact, was actually
Claire's child.

828
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,859
So every day, she sort of
sees the gravity... hey.

829
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,961
of the lie that she's telling.

830
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:48,664
Maybe you and i could
grab some coffee together.

831
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,499
She starts a relationship up
with Jack.

832
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:52,534
In fact,
they actually get engaged

833
00:37:52,701 --> 00:37:54,603
and look like they're
gonna get married.

834
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:59,708
Of course i will. Yes.
It works for a while,

835
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:01,043
but then things
start to unravel.

836
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:03,011
She's keeping a secret
from Jack.

837
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:05,714
She made a promise to sawyer
before sawyer jumped out

838
00:38:06,014 --> 00:38:08,150
of the helicopter, and she
won't tell Jack what that is.

839
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:11,553
Why won't you tell me?
- Because-Because he wouldn't want me to.

840
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,522
But he's not here, is he?

841
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:15,824
I'm the one who's here.

842
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:17,859
I'm the one who saved you.

843
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:20,696
So there's
this huge mystery

844
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:23,365
that's hanging over them,
and Jack refuses to trust her.

845
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:24,633
If you have problems,
you need to figure them out,

846
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,035
'cause I can't have you
like this around my son.

847
00:38:27,202 --> 00:38:30,539
He just won't let it go,
and their relationship explodes.

848
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:35,143
You're not even related
to him!

849
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:42,684
About ten months ago,

850
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,586
I wrote what i wanted to say
at my father's funeral

851
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:48,323
on the back of a cocktail napkin
at the Sydney airport.

852
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,559
Once Jack left the island,

853
00:38:50,726 --> 00:38:53,228
he finally gets to have
his father's funeral.

854
00:38:53,395 --> 00:38:55,097
This Australian woman
comes up to Jack afterwards

855
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:57,699
and introduces herself and says,
"I knew your father.

856
00:38:57,866 --> 00:39:01,036
"In fact, um, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

857
00:39:01,203 --> 00:39:03,372
but he's the father
of my daughter."

858
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:07,075
She was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

859
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:09,711
Her name was Claire.

860
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:13,282
Jack is now harboring
this incredible secret.

861
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:16,184
It was emotionally devastating
for him to learn,

862
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:18,854
after leaving Claire behind,
that this was his half-sister.

863
00:39:19,021 --> 00:39:21,557
Um, Jack starts popping pills
and drinking.

864
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:25,260
He starts seeing ghosts, which is bad.
He-Yeah, which is not- That's not a good thing.

865
00:39:25,427 --> 00:39:28,196
No. And he grows this
really bad beard... yeah.

866
00:39:28,363 --> 00:39:30,432
Which is another sign.
Yeah, he's not a happy guy,

867
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:32,868
and I think when you see
how getting off the island

868
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:36,805
has affected Jack, maybe in fact
this reinforces the notion

869
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:38,840
that they have
a greater destiny,

870
00:39:37,606 --> 00:39:40,108
And that
that destiny is on the island.

871
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,411
Jack finally
came to this realization

872
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:46,281
three years
after leaving the island...

873
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:50,886
when he learned of the death
of one of his fellow survivors.

874
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:53,155
When he finds out
that Locke is dead,

875
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:56,291
he's so devastated
that he tries to kill himself.

876
00:39:56,325 --> 00:39:57,993
He goes and, like, gets
on a bridge and is gonna jump.

877
00:39:58,026 --> 00:40:00,996
and you go, wow, why is jack
so upset that Locke is dead?

878
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,231
I think what
he comes to realize is

879
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:04,666
they're kind of two sides
of the same coin.

880
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,169
In a way, they kind of
need each other,

881
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:09,137
and the island needs
both of them in a way that Jack

882
00:40:09,304 --> 00:40:11,707
doesn't really understand
until that point.

883
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,843
He told me
that after I left the island,

884
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,246
Some very bad things
happened.

885
00:40:17,412 --> 00:40:20,782
And he told me that it was
my fault for leaving.

886
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:24,853
And he said
that I had to come back.

887
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,990
All of you have to go back.

888
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:32,327
We're gonna have
to bring him, too.

889
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,696
The journey for the oceanic six
is gonna be,

890
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,166
how do we actually get back to this
place? This island was very hard to find

891
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:40,636
before any shenanigans
were pulled.

892
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:42,537
Now the island
is completely gone.

893
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:44,673
So even if you wanted
to get back to it,

894
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,342
it'd be enormously difficult.
Meanwhile, the question is

895
00:40:47,376 --> 00:40:48,977
what hpened to the people
who were left behind?

896
00:40:49,044 --> 00:40:52,080
I mean, the island disappeared
in a big flash of white light.

897
00:40:52,114 --> 00:40:54,216
Where did they go,
and what are the consequences

898
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:56,718
of that flash
of white light?

899
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:00,689
We've basically spent five years
with these people now.

900
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:02,824
What's cool to us
about season five

901
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,826
is that the show's
finding a new gear.

902
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:07,195
It's starting
to slip into that mode

903
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:08,797
of answering more questions
than it's asking.

904
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,899
We really get the sense
that the characters

905
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:14,570
are moving toward something. Yeah,
there's a mythology to "lost,"

906
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,071
but each season of the show
is a book,

907
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,941
and this book has its own
particular characteristics.

908
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:21,710
and there's some really great
adventure storytelling

909
00:41:21,877 --> 00:41:25,914
in this season that the audience
is gonna really love.

910
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,317
We made a mistake.

911
00:41:28,483 --> 00:41:31,987
We... were not supposed
to leave.

912
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:36,558
Yes, we were.
