1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,360
- Is that Benjamin Linus? - We need you to save his life.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,400
If I take him, he's not ever gonna be the same again.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,960
He will always be one of us.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:19,800
Get your ass out here right now, or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,660
I stole her as a baby from an insane woman.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,630
She means nothing to me. so if you want to kill her,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,130
Go ahead and do it--

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,930
This guy is dangerous.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Sun, that boat I came here on was filled with commandos

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,700
Whose only mission was to get him.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,700
And how'd that work out for everyone?

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,460
- You know him? - Yeah.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,460
He's the man who killed me.

15
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,160
- What have you done, Richard? - Calm down

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,000
- Calm down. this has nothing to do with you. - So it's true?

17
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,180
You actually brought one of them to our temple?

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,830
He's just a boy, and he was dying.

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,600
Then you should've let him die.

20
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,400
Jacob wanted it done.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,130
The island chooses is the island's chooses.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,160
You know that.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,430
Yes. yes, of course.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,300
What's his name?

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,800
Hello, Benjamin.

26
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,860
What happened?

27
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,860
You were injured.

28
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,330
How?

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,660
You don't remember?

30
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,660
Where am i?

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,930
You're among friends.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
We're going to take care of you.

33
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,600
My dad--is he here?

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,060
You'll be back to him soon enough.

35
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,030
No. no, I don't want to go back.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,030
Okay, easy. easy. oh!

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
I don't want to go back.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
I wanna stay.

39
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,330
I wanna be one of you.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Just because you're living with them

41
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:44,660
Doesn't mean you can't be one of us.

42
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,700
You should be dead, Benjamin.

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,100
But this island...

44
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,760
It saved your life.

45
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,760
Who are you?

46
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,060
I'm Charles.

47
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,630
Charles widmore.

48
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,900
Ben.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,060
Hello, Ben.

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,000
Welcome back to the land of the living.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,830
My god.

52
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,130
You're alive.

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Yes, I am.

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,900
I knew it.

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,730
I knew that this would happen.

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,260
Then why are you so surprised to see me?

57
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,860
Because it's one thing to believe it, John.

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,460
It's another thing to see it.

59
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,330
Then why were you trying to run away to the main island?

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,960
I broke the rules,John.

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,330
I came back to the island.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,360
I was going to answer for what I'd done.

63
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,930
I was going back...

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
To be judged.

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,160
Judged?

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,600
By whom?

67
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,600
Well, j-john,

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,260
We don't even have a word for it,

69
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,500
But I believe you call it the monster.

70
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,930
Morning.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,730
Hello.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
What's in the crate?

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,830
Just some stuff we need to get moved.

74
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,630
Need a hand?

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh, thanks. we got it.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,100
Okay. have a great day.

77
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,830
How you feeling, my friend?

78
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,200
Like someone hit me with an oar, but I'll live.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,930
- What do you make of him? - I'm not sure.

80
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,360
What has he told you?

81
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,230
When you were out cold, he was watching over you.

82
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,200
And he said you killed him.

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,060
I killed him?

84
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,560
Really? 'cause he looks fine to me.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,230
You know, I don't really remember him from the plane.

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,600
- Do you? - No, I don't.

87
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,130
What if...

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,400
He was already here, before we crashed?

89
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,900
If he thinks I killed him, then he's insane.

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,460
We may be dealing with a man who's dangerously deranged.

91
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,130
Then the question is, what are we gonna do about it?

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,100
Don't worry, my friend.

93
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,400
I have your back.

94
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,200
Caesar.

95
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,030
Pleasure to meet you, Caesar. I'm Ben.

96
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,830
You want me to do it?

97
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,800
I can do it if you want me to, ben.

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,700
Shut up!

99
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,000
And stay here, Ethan.

100
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,530
Don't! don't do it.

101
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,600
You're the one who infected us, aren't you?!

102
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,860
No! shh.

103
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,700
- Donnez... -It's okay. it's okay, baby.

104
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,930
Please, don't take my Alex!

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,530
Do you want your baby to live?

106
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Why are you taking her?!

107
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Be grateful you're still alive.

108
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,900
Now you listen to me.

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,000
If you try to follow me or if you ever come looking for me,

110
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll kill you.

111
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,500
And if you want your child to live,

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,400
Every time you hear whispers, you run the other way.

113
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,830
What's that?

114
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,060
Just something sentimental.

115
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,930
So this is your old office, huh?

116
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,660
I never pictured you leading your people

117
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,660
From behind a desk.

118
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,700
It seems a little...

119
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,560
Corporate.

120
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,430
- Was there something that you needed, John? - Well, Ben, I was hoping

121
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,530
That you and I could talk about the elephant in the room.

122
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,460
I assume you're referring to the fact that I killed you.

123
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,760
Yeah.

124
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,260
It was the only way to get you back to the island,

125
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,300
Along with as many of those who left as possible.

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,230
You do remember, John--that's why you left in the first place,

127
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,130
To convince 'em to come back?

128
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
But you failed.

129
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,260
And the only way to bring them together

130
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,260
Was by your death, and you understood that.

131
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,930
It's why you were about to kill yourself when i stopped you.

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,300
If all i had to do was die, Ben, then why did you stop me?

133
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,260
You had critical information that would've died with you.

134
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,800
And once you'd given it to me...

135
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,130
Well, i just didn't have time

136
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,630
To talk you back into hanging yourself.

137
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,400
So i took a shortcut.

138
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,560
And look at you, John. i was right.

139
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,500
You're here. you're back. so are the rest of them.

140
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know where yet exactly, but they came. it worked.

141
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,060
And that's why i did it,

142
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,030
Because it was in the best interests of the island.

143
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,530
I was just hoping for an apology.

144
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,330
I've decided to help you, Ben.

145
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,460
Help me do what?

146
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,760
Do what you say you are on your way to do.

147
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,600
Be judged.

148
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,860
That's not something you want to see, John.

149
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,330
If everything you've done

150
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Has been in the best interests of the island...

151
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
Then i'm sure the monster will understand.

152
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,060
Let's go.

153
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,260
- What are you doing? - We're taking a boat.

154
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,530
Where?

155
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,700
Over to the main island.

156
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,460
I don't think so, my friend.

157
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,330
Are these your boats?

158
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Are they yours?

159
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,130
Caesar, right?

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,630
I was under the impression these were found here

161
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,630
So i'm just gonna borrow one.

162
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,960
I'm happy to leave the other boat for you

163
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:29,060
- In case you want to follow us.   - "us"?

164
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,730
Are you going with him?

165
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
He didn't really give me a choice.

166
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,860
I'm sorry, but i'm calling the shots here

167
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,060
And i say you are not taking anything.

168
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,060
What you are going to do is to sit down

169
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,527
And tell us how you know so much

170
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,700
about this island, my friend.

171
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,330
You're in the habit of calling people "friend,"

172
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,300
But i don't think you mean it.

173
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,930
-Step away from the boat.  -no. i'm

174
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,600
not gonna step awe the boats

175
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm gonna take it, and you're gonna let me, my friend.

176
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,837
You're not taking anything.

177
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:04,830
you looking for this?

178
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,530
This gentleman and i are taking a boat.

179
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Does anyone else have a problem with that?

180
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,730
Consider that my apology.

181
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,960
Home, sweet home.

182
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,386
Looks like we're not the first

183
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,900
ones who decided to tie up here

184
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,860
That would be Sun and Lapidus.

185
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,360
I showed 'em where the boats were,

186
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,330
And Sun thanked me by smashing me on the head with a paddle.

187
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,160
Oh. is she the one that hurt your arm?

188
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,900
I noticed you were favoring it on the way over.

189
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,630
No.

190
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,630
Someone else hurt my arm.

191
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,500
You just make friends everywhere you go, don't ya?

192
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, i've found sometimes that friends can be

193
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,200
Significantly more dangerous than enemies, John.

194
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,300
Is that why you shot an unarmed man in the chest?

195
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,000
The man was unarmed because i'd stolen his gun--

196
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,960
The gun he was going to use to kill you.

197
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,930
I couldn't let that happen.

198
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,030
No sense in me dying twice, right?

199
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,330
You're welcome.

200
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,930
We're going to your old house, aren't we?

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,630
Yes.

202
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,430
It's the only place i can summon it...

203
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,260
The "monster."

204
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,100
Once it arrives, i'll either be forgiven...

205
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
Or i won't.

206
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,360
I think you're lying.

207
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,200
Lying about what?

208
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,160
That you want to be judged for leaving the island

209
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,600
And coming back because it's against the rules.

210
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,480
I don't think you care about rules.

211
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,900
Then what do i want to be judged for, John?

212
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,100
For killing your daughter.

213
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,730
Did you do it?

214
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,860
We had a...

215
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,530
Complication.

216
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,030
I'm sorry. is that a... baby?

217
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,160
Your orders were to exterminate that woman.

218
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,200
Why? she's no threat to us. she's insane, Charles.

219
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,160
Besides, you didn't tell me she had a child.

220
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,800
What was it i was supposed to do?

221
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,030
Kill it.

222
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
It's not an "it." this is a child.

223
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
You might find this difficult to understand, Benjamin...

224
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
Every decision i've made has been about

225
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,530
Protecting this island.

226
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,930
Is killing this baby what Jacob wants?

227
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,360
Then here she is.

228
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,730
You do it.

229
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,900
So whose idea was it to move into these houses?

230
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,560
Excuse me?

231
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,560
Well, your people were living in the jungle.

232
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,530
And then after you murdered the Dharma folk,

233
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
You relocated here.

234
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,730
I just wondered if it was your idea.

235
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,590
Do you disapprove, John?

236
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,800
It just doesn't seem like something the island would want.

237
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,730
You don't have the first idea what this island wants.

238
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,160
Are you sure about that?

239
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,900
That was your house, wasn't it?

240
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,860
Yes, and that's Alex's room.

241
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,660
Well, i suppose you better go over there and check it out.

242
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,400
Sun?

243
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,300
What are you doing here?

244
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,330
This used to be my house. i saw a light turned on.

245
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,200
What are the two of you doing in here?

246
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,360
- That was taken in 1977.  - Are you trying to tell me

247
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,730
That your friends were in the Dharma initiative?

248
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,100
You don't know about this?

249
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,560
Of course not.

250
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,760
Where did you get this? who gave this to you?

251
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,900
We met some crazy old man outside.

252
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,260
He said his name was Christian.

253
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,300
- He told us to come in here and wait. - Wait for what?

254
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,860
He said if i ever wanted to see my husband again,

255
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,160
I had to wait here for John locke.

256
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,330
But considering he's dead, we ain't holding our breath.

257
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,560
Well, you might want to look outside.

258
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,400
What you're saying, it's...

259
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,700
Impossible.

260
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,100
But here I am.

261
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,800
I don't know how, I don't know why,

262
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,000
But I'm sure there's a very good reason for it.

263
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,700
As long as the dead guy says there's a reason,

264
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,430
Well, then I guess everything's gonna be just peachy.

265
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,300
And forget about the fact that the rest of your people

266
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,300
Are supposedly 30 years ago...

267
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,260
Now the only ones who are here to help us

268
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,660
Are a murderer and a guy who can't seem to remember

269
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,700
How the hell he got out of a coffin.

270
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,660
Sun, please, let's just go back to the plane,

271
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,265
See if I can fix the radio,

272
00:20:55,265 --> 00:20:56,800
and maybe we can get some help.

273
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,730
If you leave with him,

274
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,630
you'll never find your husband again.

275
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm all the help you need.

276
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,300
Are you saying you know how to find them?

277
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
How to find Jin?

278
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,400
I have some ideas.

279
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm sorry to say,

280
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,730
But I'm leaving with or without you.

281
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,300
If there's any chance of finding my husband,

282
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,460
Then I have to stay.

283
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,030
All right.

284
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,760
For god sake, watch your back.

285
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,300
All right.

286
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,760
How do we find Jin?

287
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,230
Ben has something to do first. isn't that right, Ben?

288
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,660
Yes, John. That's right.

289
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,400
Better get to it then.

290
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,100
I'll be outside.

291
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,330
Again, daddy! again!

292
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,300
Okay. okay. wow, Alex!

293
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,260
Any higher, and you're gonna fly right off the island.

294
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,860
The sub's about to leave.

295
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,500
Higher, daddy! higher!

296
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,030
All right.

297
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,200
You don't have to see him off, Ben.

298
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,700
Yes, Richard, I do.

299
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,800
Higher! higher, daddy!

300
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,260
Charles!

301
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,830
I came to say good-bye.

302
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,860
No, you didn't. you came to gloat.

303
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,960
No, don't act as if I wanted this.

304
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,100
You brought this on yourself.

305
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,160
Are you quite certain you want to do this, benjamin?

306
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,460
You left the island regularly. you had a daughter

307
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,930
With an outsider. you broke the rules, charles.

308
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,150
And what makes you think you deserve to take what's mine?

309
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,260
Because I won't be selfish.

310
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,360
Because I'll sacrifice anything to protect this island.

311
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,030
You wouldn't sacrifice alex.

312
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,030
You're the one who wanted her dead, charles,

313
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,130
Not the island.

314
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,230
I hope you're right, benjamin,

315
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
Because if you aren't,

316
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,700
And it is the island that wants her dead,

317
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,300
She'll be dead.

318
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,500
And one day, you'll be standing where I'm standing now.

319
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,830
You'll be the one being banished,

320
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,800
And then you'll finally realize

321
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,800
That you cannot fight the inevitable.

322
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,160
I'll be seeing you, boy.

323
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,600
Where did john go?

324
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,560
He said he had something to do.

325
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,600
Did he say what it was?

326
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,930
No, I didn't ask.

327
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,330
Jack must have lied.

328
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,830
Excuse me? about locke being dead?

329
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,130
I don't know why he would, but that's the only explanation.

330
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,130
Jack didn't lie. john was dead.

331
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Just because he was in a coffin

332
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,260
Doesn't mean that he couldn't have faked his dea--

333
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,930
Trust me. I'm sure.

334
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,060
So you knew this would happen to locke

335
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,260
If we brought him back here?

336
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,430
Sun, I had no idea it would happen.

337
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,930
I've seen this island do miraculous things.

338
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
I've seen it heal the sick,

339
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,130
But never once has it done anything like this.

340
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,700
Dead is dead.

341
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,160
You don't get to come back from that,

342
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,200
Not even here.

343
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,360
So the fact that john locke is walking around this island...

344
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,330
Scares the living hell out of me.

345
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,830
You may want to go inside.

346
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,400
Why?

347
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,400
Because what's about to come out of that jungle

348
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,660
Is something I can't control.

349
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,760
Any luck?

350
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,730
It hasn't shown up yet.

351
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,900
Last time we didn't have to wait this long.

352
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,430
It's not a train, john. it doesn't run on a schedule.

353
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,800
Well, if it's not gonna come to us, then...

354
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,300
I suppose we'll have to go to it.

355
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,660
It doesn't work that way. I only know how to summon it.

356
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,660
I don't know where it actually is.

357
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,230
I do.

358
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,760
It's weird for me, too.

359
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,330
Excuse me?

360
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,300
I realize how strange this all is--

361
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,460
Me, here.

362
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,530
But I assure you, sun,

363
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,860
I'm the same man I've always been.

364
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,100
Are you ready?

365
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,330
Lead the way.

366
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,200
Hello?

367
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,660
Charles? it's Benjamin.

368
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,760
How did you get this number?

369
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,160
Doesn't matter. what matters is

370
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,230
I'm going back to the island today.

371
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,100
The island won't let you come back, trust me.

372
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,430
I've spent almost 20 years trying to return.

373
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,200
Well, charles, where you failed, I'm going to succeed...

374
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,860
Just as soon as I do one thing.

375
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,060
And what's that, benjamin?

376
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,660
Kill your daughter.

377
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,230
In fact, I'm looking at "our mutual friend" right now.

378
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

379
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,060
- It's the name of the boat that penny's on. - Don't you dare.

380
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,360
Good-bye, Charles.

381
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,030
May I ask you a question, John?

382
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,730
Shoot.

383
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,760
How is it that you know where you're going?

384
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,160
I just know.

385
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,160
I mean, how does that work, exactly?

386
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,660
How does what work?

387
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,930
The knowing. I mean, did it come upon you gradually,

388
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,900
Or did you wake up one morning

389
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,900
Suddenly understanding the mysteries of the universe?

390
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,730
- You don't like this, do you? - What?

391
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,360
Having to ask questions

392
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,360
That you don't know the answers to,

393
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,330
Blindly following someone in the hopes that

394
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,500
They'll lead you to whatever it is you're looking for.

395
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,700
No, John, I don't like it at all.

396
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,500
Well, now you know what it was like to be me.

397
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,330
We should keep moving.

398
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,230
Yes, we should.

399
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,700
I think I know where we're going now, John.

400
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,730
Do you?

401
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,600
It's the same place they brought me as a child.

402
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,430
It's where the island healed me.

403
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,860
Let's hope it's as generous this time around.

404
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,430
What is it?

405
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,630
It's the wall around our temple.

406
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,000
What temple?

407
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,230
About a half mile from here.

408
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,200
We built this wall to keep people like the two of you

409
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,900
From ever seeing it.

410
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,600
We're not going into your temple, Ben.

411
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,900
We're going under it.

412
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,260
After you.

413
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,030
I need to ask a favor of you, Sun.

414
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,430
If you can ever get off this island,

415
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,260
Find Desmond Hume for me. Tell him I said I was sorry.

416
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,560
Sorry for what?

417
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,730
He'll know.

418
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,160
What are you doing here?

419
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,460
Desmond!

420
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,660
Desmond!

421
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,960
Des?!

422
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,300
Don't move.

423
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,930
Not another word.

424
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
Hello, Penelope.

425
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,030
My name is Benjamin Linus.

426
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,230
I'm sorry that you're caught up in the middle of this thing,

427
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,380
- But your father-- - My father and I

428
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,830
Have absolutely no relationship whatsoever,

429
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,730
- So whatever-- - Your father is a really terrible human being.

430
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,460
He's responsible for the killing of my daughter.

431
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,960
That's why I'm here.

432
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,860
Mommy!

433
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,260
Charlie, go back inside, babe.

434
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,700
Go back inside. Please.

435
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,500
Please, whatever you do, don't hurt my son.

436
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,860
- Please don't hurt my son. - Mommy? Mommy?

437
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,630
Charlie, go inside!

438
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,660
Captain Lapidus! Captain Lapidus!

439
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,700
You're back. thank god.

440
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,360
They found guns.

441
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,960
What are you talking about? who found guns?

442
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,900
Ilana and three of the others.

443
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,200
They said they were in charge now.

444
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,060
Where are they?

445
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,860
Ilana!

446
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,860
What's going on?

447
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,130
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

448
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,230
What?

449
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,060
Answer the question!

450
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,060
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

451
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,300
I have no idea what the--

452
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,760
Get everyone else. tell them it's time.

453
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,930
And tie him up.

454
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,130
He's coming with us.

455
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,060
You know, you were right.

456
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,860
About what?

457
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,860
Why I need to be judged.

458
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,860
When Charles Widmore's men came,

459
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,930
They gave me a choice.

460
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,760
Either leave the island or let my daughter die.

461
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,560
All I had to do was walk out of the house

462
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,100
And go with them.

463
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,100
But I didn't do it.

464
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,800
So you were right.

465
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:00,030
John, I did kill Alex.

466
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,360
And now I have to answer for that.

467
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,560
I appreciate you showing me the way,

468
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,630
But I think I can take it from here.

469
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,200
You got it.

470
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:28,860
I'll meet you outside, if I live--

471
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,760
Ben!

472
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,200
Are you all right?

473
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,930
Never better.

474
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Hang on. I'll find something to get you out of there.

475
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,500
John, wait!

476
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,860
You didn't tell me she had a child.

477
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,430
What was it I was supposed to do?

478
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,630
- Kill it. - It's not an "it." This is a child.

479
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,200
Higher! Again, daddy! Again!

480
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,430
Higher! Higher, daddy!

481
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,330
I hate you!

482
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,700
I hate your guts! I wish you were dead.

483
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,030
These people--

484
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,660
You said they're dangerous.

485
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,360
More dangerous than you?

486
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,200
Dad, they're serious.

487
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,330
They killed Karl and my mother.

488
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,030
Please, dad.

489
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,530
Help me!

490
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,900
She's not my daughter.

491
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,860
She means nothing to me.

492
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:17,030
So if you wanna kill her, go ahead and--

493
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,030
Daddy?

494
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,760
Alex.

495
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,730
Hi, dad.

496
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,030
Ohh, alex.

497
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm so, so sorry.

498
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,560
It was all my fault.

499
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,630
I know.

500
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,560
Listen to me, you bastard! I know

501
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,660
That you're already planning to kill John again,

502
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,230
And I want you to know that if you so much as touch him,

503
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,860
I will hunt you down and destroy you.

504
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,700
You will listen to every word John locke says,

505
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,860
And you will follow his every order.

506
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,960
Do you understand?

507
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,200
Say it!

508
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,660
Say you'll follow him.

509
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,460
Yes, I will. I'll follow him. I swear.

510
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,730
Ben?

511
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,560
Ben!

512
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,500
Ben?

513
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,400
What happened?

514
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,160
It let me live.
