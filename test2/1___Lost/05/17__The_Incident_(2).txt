1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,592
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,956
Jack is on his way
to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,234
We have to stop him.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,036
Jack, we need to be there
at the moment of the incident.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,549
- Why the hell are we stopping?
- That's why.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,754
- What's going on, Kate?
- Doc, we gotta talk.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,668
- You wanna talk, get in the van...
- I ain't gettin' in the van!

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,753
I need five minutes. Say what I gotta
say, then you can do whatever you want.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,870
But you're gonna listen.
You owe me that much.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,079
Five minutes.

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,472
Dr Shephard? You all right?

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,755
The dural sac. I cut it.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,389
- Give me some suction.
- Calm down. It's all right.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,596
- Fluid's leaking.
- Look at me.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,558
- Give me some suction.
- Jack.

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,517
Look at me.

17
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,319
Count to five.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,198
- What are you talking about?
- Stitching up the sac

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,272
so this girl isn't paralysed
for the rest of her life.

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,670
The only way you're gonna do that
is not to be afraid.

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,070
So close your eyes and count to five.

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,435
And then fix her, Jack.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,632
Or I'll have to fix her for you.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,310
One, two,

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,278
three, four...

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,989
...five.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,073
Sutures.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,636
Hey, kiddo.

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,871
Girl's in recovery, responsive
to stimulus below the waist,

30
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,077
so no paralysis.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,517
Good.

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,749
Something wrong, Jack?

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,794
You embarrassed me.

34
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,552
- Did I?
- It was bad enough

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,996
that everybody thinks
the reason I got this residency

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,436
is because you're my father.
But then you...

37
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,671
You put me in a timeout
during my first major procedure!

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,876
In front of my entire team.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,197
Dad, I know you don't believe in me,

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,872
but I need them to.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,198
Are you sure I'm the one
who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,793
One of these yours?

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,799
- Machine got stuck.
- Guess it just needed a little push.

44
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,956
- Take a load off, doc.
- No, thanks.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,598
Sit down, Jack.

46
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,919
My folks died when I was eight.
I ever tell you that?

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,433
No.

48
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,398
Con man took my dad
for everything he had.

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,916
He didn't handle it too well, so...

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,551
Shot my mom.
Then he blew his own head off.

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,315
I was hiding under the bed when it
happened. Heard the whole thing.

52
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,031
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,271
That was a year ago.

54
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,155
- What?
- Right now it's July, 1977.

55
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,231
Which means that happened last year.

56
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,233
So I could have hopped on the sub,
gone back to the States,

57
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,838
walked right into my house and
stopped my daddy from killing anybody.

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,911
Why didn't you?

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,831
Because, Jack...

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,230
...what's done is done.

61
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,432
It doesn't have to be that way.

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,310
What did you screw up so bad the
first time, you'll blow up a damn nuke

63
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,755
- for a second chance?
- Not what this is about.

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,796
Then what is it about?

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,790
Three years ago, Locke told me that
all this was happening for a reason.

66
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,192
- That us being here was our destiny.
- I don't speak destiny.

67
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,280
What I do understand
is a man does what he does

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,635
'cause he wants something for himself.

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,870
What do you want, Jack?

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,917
I had her.

71
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,393
I had her, and I lost her.

72
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,591
Kate?

73
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,198
Damn, doc, she's standing
on the other side of those trees.

74
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,478
- You want her back, just ask her.
- No, it's too late for that.

75
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,993
Your five minutes is up.

76
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,956
Jack!
If what you're doing even works,

77
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,794
you and Kate will be strangers.
And she'll be in damn handcuffs.

78
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,440
What's meant to be is meant to be.

79
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,032
I guess there's nothing I can say
that'll change your mind.

80
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,792
I guess there's not.

81
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,351
Who the hell do you think you are?!

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,112
Think you can come here
and do whatever the hell you want?

83
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,798
I had a life here!

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,512
Sawyer, listen...

85
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,719
You don't get it.

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,158
Will you stop?

87
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,629
- Will you stop?!
- No.

88
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,919
James!

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,512
- Let him go.
- He wouldn't listen.

90
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,512
- I had to. He won't stop!
- That's because he's right.

91
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,474
- What?
- He's right.

92
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,710
James, we have to do this.

93
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,189
What are you talking about?

94
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,431
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

95
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,635
What happened?!

96
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,757
I changed my mind.

97
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,791
Girls, your dad and I have something
we need to talk to you both about.

98
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,031
- Are we moving again?
- No, stupid.

99
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,678
- They're getting a divorce.
- Rachel.

100
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,954
Well, aren't you?

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,512
- Yes.
- But we need you both to understand

102
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,674
that your father and I,
we still love each other.

103
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,753
Because people love each other doesn't
mean they're supposed to be together.

104
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,550
- What if you are supposed to be?
- We're not, honey.

105
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,074
- But how can you know for sure?
- We just know.

106
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,118
And, when you're a grownup,

107
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,077
you'll understand.

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,591
I don't wanna understand!

109
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,229
- Juliet, wait!
- I don't wanna understand!

110
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,357
- Stop! We gotta talk about this!
- There's nothing to talk about.

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,716
- Let Jack do what he came here to do.
- Maybe you should have told me

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,598
you had a change of heart before
I brought him out to kick his ass!

113
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,874
- Would that have stopped you?
- No!

114
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,635
- Glad you got it out of your system.
- Hey!

115
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,029
Don't!

116
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,351
I need you to tell me
where all this is coming from.

117
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,796
One minute, you're leading the
great sub escape, now you're onboard

118
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,677
with blowing up the damn island?

119
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,111
I got a right to know
why you changed your mind.

120
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,869
I changed my mind
when I saw you look at her.

121
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,676
Don't... Don't.

122
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,558
I don't care who I looked at.

123
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,153
I'm with you.

124
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,274
And you would stay
with me forever if I let you.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,238
And that is why I will always love you.

126
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,111
What we had was just for a while.
Just because we love each other

127
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,751
doesn't mean we're meant to be together.
Maybe we were never supposed to be.

128
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,470
So if Jack can make it that none of
you ever come here, then he should.

129
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,157
Why are you doing this, Juliet?

130
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,552
I...

131
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,151
If I never meet you,
then I never have to lose you.

132
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,398
Slow down that drill.

133
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,959
This has got to be...
It can't be like that.

134
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,632
Radzinsky!

135
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,278
- What is it now?
- Gauss readings jumped off the charts.

136
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,358
Let me see.

137
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,598
- This is it. On top of the pocket.
- If we drill and hit that pocket,

138
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,559
- all hell is gonna break loose.
- <i>Radzinsky, are you there? Over.</i>

139
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,313
- <i>Stuart, come in.</i>
- What do you want, Phil?

140
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,675
That Hostile
that shot the kid came back.

141
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,275
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Here at the barracks.

142
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,954
He attacked us and got rescued
by some other recruits.

143
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,838
- They stole a van and took off.
- Took off where?

144
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,912
I don't know.
Roger said one of them had a bomb.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,356
That Hostile knows about the Swan.

146
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,433
Get some men and some guns,
get your asses out here right now!

147
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,636
If they're coming here,
we'll be ready.

148
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,199
Come on!

149
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,072
Jack?

150
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,669
What happened?

151
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,196
My talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.

152
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,871
- Does it hurt?
- It's OK.

153
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,598
OK.

154
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,477
Do you remember when I sewed you up
when we first got here?

155
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,152
Yeah.

156
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,997
Seems like a million years ago.

157
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,512
Or 30 years from now.

158
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,832
Kate, why did you make me promise
to never ask about Aaron?

159
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,235
Because I was...

160
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,318
...so angry with you
for making me come back here.

161
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,915
Is he why you came back?

162
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,593
I came back so he
could be where he belongs.

163
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,516
- With his mother.
- If this works,

164
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,592
Claire'll never come to the island.
They'll always be together,

165
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,671
- the way they're meant to be.
- She was gonna give him up.

166
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,877
You don't know what she'd do.
And, whatever it is,

167
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,757
it would be her choice.

168
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,749
If you wanna save Claire,
this is the only way to do it.

169
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,279
But nothing... Nothing in my life
has ever felt so right.

170
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,953
And...

171
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,031
...I just need you to believe that.

172
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,628
Keep cooling it!
Don't let it get hot!

173
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,236
- Keep the drill going!
- It's about to happen.

174
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,432
Are you with me on this?

175
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,990
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

176
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,269
...two, three, four.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

177
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,439
One wallet.

178
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,674
Two hundred and 27 dollars cash.

179
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,631
One ballpoint pen.

180
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,229
One Fruit Roll-Up.

181
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,631
- Sign here.
- You don't understand. It's a mistake.

182
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,472
I killed a bunch of people.

183
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
You see this?
This is a discharge form.

184
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,554
You've been cleared.
So take your stuff and go.

185
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,758
Look, dude, there are men
with tranquiliser guns

186
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,957
hunting me down. They want to
bring me somewhere against my will.

187
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,751
There's a cab stand right out front.

188
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,676
- Sorry. I didn't see it was taken.
- I'm only going a few blocks.

189
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,751
- You want to share?
- Cool! You sure?

190
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,273
Come on in.

191
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,270
- You want some? It's cherry.
- No, thanks.

192
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,518
- What were you in for?
- Excuse me?

193
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,434
Jail. I was there
'cause I killed three people.

194
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,796
I didn't really.
Guess they figured it out.

195
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,792
- What about you?
- I wasn't in jail.

196
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,235
Then what were you doing
sitting outside a prison in a cab?

197
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,430
I was waiting for you, Hugo.

198
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,470
- Then you must be dead.
- I'm definitely not dead.

199
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,748
What do you want from me?

200
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,195
I wanna know why
you won't go back to the island.

201
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,277
- 'Cause I'm cursed.
- Is that so?

202
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,671
That's why the plane crashed,

203
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,355
my friends died, Libby, Charlie.

204
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,796
Now they visit me,
and I can't make it stop.

205
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,113
What if you weren't cursed?

206
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,397
- What if you were blessed?
- How do you mean, blessed?

207
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,917
Well, you get to talk to
the people you've lost.

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,072
- Seems like a wonderful thing to me.
- Sure, it's wonderful

209
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,312
- except for the part where I'm crazy.
- I've got some news for you, Hugo.

210
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,960
You're just gonna have to
take my word on this.

211
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,917
You are not crazy.

212
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,517
- Who are you, dude?
- I'm just up here on the corner.

213
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,514
Ajira Airways, flight 316 out of LAX.
Leaves in 24 hours.

214
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,912
All you have to do is be on that plane.
It's your choice, Hugo.

215
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,276
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

216
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,833
- Wait! You forgot your guitar.
- It's not my guitar.

217
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,596
Don't worry, dude. Everything'll be
fine when Jack changes the future.

218
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,238
Or the past. One of those.

219
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,914
I don't think
your buddy's gonna make it.

220
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,029
He'll make it.

221
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,469
- Dude, what happened to your face?
- Nothing.

222
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,152
We were just up on a ridge where we
could look down into the Swan site.

223
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,869
Something just happened down there.
They hit something.

224
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,756
- It's time for me to go.
- It's all set to go.

225
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,195
Remember, be careful.

226
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,748
It's rigged to explode on impact.

227
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,469
According to Faraday's plan, you must
get the bomb as close as you can

228
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,279
to the source of electromagnetism.

229
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,829
Sayid, this is gonna work.

230
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,638
And it'll save you.

231
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,996
Nothing can save me.

232
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,432
See you in Los Angeles.

233
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,276
What is it? Why are we stopping?

234
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,832
You'll see.

235
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,396
Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard,
but what's it have to do with Jacob?

236
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,039
It's where he lives.

237
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,672
Oh, my God!

238
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,040
Oh, my God! Call 911!

239
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,550
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

240
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,395
I'm sorry this happened to you.

241
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,716
Are you sure you need to do this?

242
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,800
If you waited,
Jacob would come to you, John.

243
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,791
I'm tired of waiting.

244
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,273
Where is he, Richard?

245
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,399
What happened to the rest of the statue?

246
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,395
I don't know.
It was like that when I got here.

247
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,196
Do you expect me to believe that?

248
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,471
Not really.

249
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,673
All right, Ben. Let's go.

250
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,873
What are you doing?

251
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,554
- John wants me to join him.
- You can't bring him in.

252
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,790
- Why not?
- Only our leader can request

253
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,838
an audience with Jacob.
There can only be one leader at a time.

254
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,232
I'm beginning to think you just
make these rules up as you go along.

255
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,836
Ben is coming in with me. If that's a
problem, Jacob and I can work it out.

256
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,351
Tell him I said hello.

257
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,072
Will you be able to do this, Ben?

258
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,954
I know it won't be easy,
but things will change once he's gone.

259
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,669
I promise.

260
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,591
- Can I ask you something, LaFleur?
- There ain't no more LaFleur.

261
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,076
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Has it occurred to any of you

262
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,199
that your buddy's actually gonna cause
the thing he's trying to prevent?

263
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,395
Perhaps that little nuke
is the incident.

264
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,315
So maybe the best thing to do
is nothing.

265
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,878
I'm glad you all thought this through.

266
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,032
- What's going on?
- It's Phil.

267
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,509
That's the road to the Swan.

268
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,955
If they see Jack, they'll kill him.

269
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,755
What do you think, blondie?

270
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,756
Live together and die alone.

271
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,036
Still running pretty hot.

272
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,315
- Good for you. You got here fast.
- Any sign of them?

273
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,674
Not yet. You got time
to set up a perimeter.

274
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,594
- Did you call these men to the site?
- You, rear. You, top.

275
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,310
- We need to get people away from here!
- Top of the scaffolding. Go, now!

276
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,079
There!

277
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,753
Go, go, over there!

278
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,628
Get him!

279
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,799
Flank him! Get him now!

280
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,869
Who's this?!

281
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,992
Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man.
Tell 'em to put the guns down!

282
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,672
Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

283
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,398
You can come out now, doc!

284
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,396
Hurry up and do your business.

285
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,473
Turn that damn thing off!

286
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,679
What's the matter?

287
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,395
- It won't shut down!
- Why not?

288
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,870
- Something's pulling the drill down!
- We hit the pocket!

289
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,838
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waiting for? Drop it!

290
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,508
This don't look like LAX.

291
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,073
Dad!

292
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,589
Jack!

293
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,870
Get away from here!
Get as far away from here as you can!

294
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,149
- Get in! What the hell's going on?
- Let's get out of here!

295
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,433
Go, go, go!

296
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,071
Hey, LaFleur!

297
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,193
- Help!
- Juliet!

298
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,276
Come on! Sawyer, help!

299
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,759
Juliet!

300
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,431
Where do you think you're going?

301
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,997
Kate! Help me get those chains off!

302
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,231
Hold on. You hold on!

303
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,437
- I can't! I can't get it off!
- I got you.

304
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,477
I can't!

305
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,030
- I can't reach her!
- You hold on!

306
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,679
I got you.

307
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,588
Sawyer!

308
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,873
- Don't you leave me.
- It's OK.

309
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,234
Don't you leave me!

310
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,516
- I love you!
- No, you don't let go!

311
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,397
- I love you, James.
- No!

312
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,268
- I love you so much!
- No! No, don't let go!

313
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,993
Juliet! No!

314
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,590
- Water?
- Do you have any alcohol?

315
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,796
No. Sure wish I did.

316
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,993
Don't shoot.

317
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,154
It's OK.

318
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,353
It's all right.

319
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,438
Which one of you is Ricardos?

320
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,797
It's Richard, actually.

321
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,797
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

322
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,593
Richard. I'm Ilana.

323
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,756
I have something you need to see.

324
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,514
Open it up.

325
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,353
It's OK. It's OK. Let them.

326
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,793
- Where did you find him?
- In the cargo hold of the plane

327
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,199
we came here on.

328
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,712
In a coffin.

329
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,989
I don't understand.

330
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,872
If this is Locke, who's in there?

331
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,789
You like it?

332
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,798
I did it myself.

333
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,559
Takes a very long time
when you're making the thread,

334
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,758
but I suppose that's the point,
isn't it?

335
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,879
Hello, Jacob.

336
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,752
You found your loophole.

337
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,993
Indeed I did.

338
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,910
And you have no idea

339
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,355
what I've gone through

340
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,192
to be here.

341
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,749
- Have you met before?
- In a manner of speaking.

342
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,271
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

343
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,958
Benjamin, whatever he's told you,

344
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,315
I want you to understand one thing.

345
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,956
You have a choice.

346
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,512
What choice?

347
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,238
You can do what he asks,
or you can go.

348
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,359
Leave us to discuss our... issues.

349
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,037
So now, after all this time,

350
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,233
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

351
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,435
Thirty-five years
I lived on this island.

352
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,719
And all I ever heard was your name,
over and over.

353
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,078
Richard would bring me your
instructions, all those slips of paper.

354
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,549
All those lists.

355
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,071
And I never questioned anything.

356
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,993
I did as I was told.

357
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,558
But when I dared to ask
to see you myself,

358
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,315
I was told, "You have to wait.

359
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,073
You have to be patient."

360
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,594
But when he asked to see you,

361
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,435
he gets marched straight up here
as if he was Moses.

362
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,511
So why him?

363
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,718
What was it that was so wrong with me?

364
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,956
What about me?

365
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,196
What about you?

366
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,072
Well...

367
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,552
- They're coming.
- What?

368
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,113
I can't hear you.

369
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,077
They're coming.

370
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,311
- Juliet!
- Sawyer, get off of there!

371
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,392
You have to come out!

372
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,589
It's going down!
This thing is gonna go!

373
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,670
You have to go,
this thing is gonna go at any second.

374
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,433
Jack!
Jack, help me get him off of here.

375
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,552
Come on!

376
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,909
Come on! Come on,
you son of a bitch!
