<i>when a freighter transporting a team 
of scientists arrived near the island.

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,960
<i>But rescue was not the primary mission.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
This is Charles Widmore, the man 
whose boat is parked offshore.

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,430
What does he want?

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,080
<i>Charles Widmore was a mysterious and powerful man 
and the nemesis of Benjamin Linus,

47
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
<i>the leader of the Others.

48
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,880
<i>Widmore had been trying to locate 
the island for years,

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>and he staged the recovery of flight 815 
to keep anyone else from finding the island.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Get your ass out here right now.

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,550
<i>Another team from the freighter arrived...

I'm not coming out of this house.

54

<i>And in the process, Ben's daughter,
Alex, became a casualty.

55

So if you want to kill her, go ahead and do it.

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,500
<i>So the survivors made a deal.

57
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,760
What was the arrangement?

58
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,930
They, uh, help us free you,
and we let 'em off the island.

59
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,710
Fair enough.

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,020
The helicopter is yours.

61
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,740
You have a safe journey back.

62
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,660
So we can go off the island?

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,260
That's it?

64
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,020

It's the only way to protect it.

68
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,980
It's an island, John.

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,050
No one needs to protect it.

70
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,800
It's not an island.

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,940
It's a place where miracles happen.

72
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,440
Let's go, Freckles.

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,000
I've seen enough of this rock.

74
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,310
Let's go for a ride!

75
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,480
<i>Jack, Kate, Sawyer and their friends 
left for the freighter by chopper,

<i>as the science team took others by boat.

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,200
<i>But the chopper was leaking fuel...

78
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,130
<i>so Sawyer took action.

79
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,230
Why are you telling me this?

80
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,920
Just do it, Freckles.

81
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,120
Sawyer!

82
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,760
<i>Sawyer helped his friends
and made his way back to the island,

83
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,080
<i>where Locke assumed his new role 
as leader of the Others.

84
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,600
Hello, John. Welcome home.

85
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,960
<i>But with the freighter still offshore,
Ben went deep below the Orchid station

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,260
<i>to move the island so Charles Widmore 
could never find it again.

87
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,670
There it is! The boat! I see it!

88
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,170
<i>The chopper reached the freighter,
only to find that it was rigged with explosives.

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,990
- It's Jin! Turn around!
- We can't do it!

90
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,000
Jin!

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,620
What are you doing here?

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,360
Decided to take a dip.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,230
What you celebratin'?

94
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,160
I'm not celebrating.

95
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,650
is that our boat?

96
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,700
It was.

97
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,470
<i>With the freighter destroyed, the chopper 
had no choice but to return to the island.

98
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,650
Yeah, what is that?

99
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,860
<i>But the island was gone.

100
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,790
That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

101
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,300
I can't believe he did it.

102
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
He moved the island.

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,640
No, he didn't.

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
You got another explanation, man,
I'd love to hear it.

105
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,850
There's a boat out there!

106
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,070
We're gonna have to lie.

107
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,260
Lie about what?

108
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,890
Our plane was discovered 
on the bottom of the ocean.

109
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,650
Well, someone put it there... someone who 
wants everyone to think that we're dead.

110
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,680
So what do you think's gonna happen to us 
when we tell them that that wasn't our plane?

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,770
What do you think's gonna happen 
to the people that we left behind?

112
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,480
Just let me do the talking.

113
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,180
- Throw them a rope!
- Penny?

114
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,960
<i>Penny Widmore was Desmond's 
long- lost love,

115
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,060
<i>and she'd been searching for him 
for over three years.

116
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:52,410
I love you, Penny, and I'll never leave you again.

117
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,920
<i>On board Penny's boat, 
Jack planned the next move,

<i>while Kate focused on Aaron,
the son of Claire,

119
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,430
<i>an oceanic survivor who went 
missing on the island.

120
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,020
I think we should say he's mine.

121
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,630
After everyonee've lost...
Michael, Jin and Sawyer...

122
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,620
I can't lose him, too.

123
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,520
Sawyer's not dead.

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,320
But he's gone.

125
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,870
Kate...

126
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,550
tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have 
to convince everyone to lie.

127
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,650
Are you with me?

128
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,670
I have always been with you.

129
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, are we all okay with this?

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,820
Kate?

131
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,680
Sun?

132
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
I don't think we should lie, dude.

133
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,040
I mean, the island disappeared.
We all saw it.it's gone. Bloop!

134
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,280
You think anyone's gonna believe that?

135
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,870
We need to protect the people 
that we left behind,Hurley.

136
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,790
I don't want to spend the rest 
of my life lying. Do you?

137
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,610
No, but I don't believe we have 
a better choice and so it began.

138
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,690
<i>Jack and his fellow survivors said 
good- bye to Penny and Desmond,

<i>News of their miraculous rescue 
spread quickly,

141

<i>and before they made
their way back to civilization,

142

<i>they'd become instant celebrities.

143
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,790
There's a lot of press that want 
to speak to you.

144
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,670
They're referring to you as "the Oceanic Six".

145
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:22,590
<i>The oceanic six were finally home,
a moment they never dreamed would arrived.

146
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,840
<i>But the life that awaited them 
was not what they'd hoped for,

147
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,810
<i>and with the world waiting to hear 
their story, the lie was about to begin.

148
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,640
It happened really fast. I remember the impact,
the plane fiing up with water.

149
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,000
A group of us got to the emergency door,
and, um, got out before it went down.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,120
Given the amazing circumstances 
surrounding the survival of you six,

151
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,520
it is possible there are any other survivors 
from the crash yet to be discovered?

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,210
No. Absolutely not.

153
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,990
Mom?

154
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,410
Hello?

155
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,300
<i>The survivors tried to adjust

all the way home.

157
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,850
Surprise!

158
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,440
Interesting choice of theme.

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,650
Yeah, mom really doesn't get it, dude.

160
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,560
<i>It was clear that family and friends 
could not begin to understand

161
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,200
<i>what the survivors had been through...

162
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,510
<i>Hurley grew troubled
- Turn around!

163
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,360
<i>when he began having encounters 
with oceanic survivors who died on the island.

164
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,870
Help! Help!

165
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,730
What the hell is wrong with you?

166
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,150
Are you trying to get tossed
into the nuthouse?

167
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,760
Because ifhat's what you want, I can make
that happen right now, my friend.

168
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,770
You can?

169
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,250
Thank you!

170
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,690
<i>But it was becoming clear...

171
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,140
- Jack!
<i>the decision to lie would always haunt them.

172
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,580
I don't think we did the right thing, Jack.

173
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,100
I think it wants us to come back.

174
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,680
- Hurley...
- And it' gonna do everything it can...

175
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,960
We're never going back!

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,780
Never say never, dude.

177
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,500
<i>The events of the rescue had 
an even greater impact on Sun.

178
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,870
<i>She was unable to move past Jin's presumed 
death and took out her pain on her father.

179
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,030
<i>Without Jin, the birth of her daughter 
was bittersweet.

180
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,710
<i>But Sun's grief soon turned to vengeance.

181
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,610
Excuse me. Mr.Widmore?

182
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,050
I'm Sun Kwon.

183
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,270
You mentioned that you and I had...
common interests.

184
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,890
Why don't you tell me exactly 
what they might be?

185
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,320
To kill Benjamin Linus.

186
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,290
<i>The Oceanic Six were not the only 
people to leave the island.

187
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,600
<i>After rning the wheel, Benjamin Linus 
was transported to the tunisian desert,

188
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,550
<i>10 months in the future, and it wasn't long 
before Ben made contact with the Oceanic Six.

189
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,870
I just want to bury my wife in peace.

190
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,210
Mr. Jarrah, there'a woman outside.

191
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,320
She says she knows you, but she 
wasn't on the list of family members.

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,370
Nadia?

193
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,570
After the rescue, Sayid was reunited 
with his long- lost love,

194
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,360
<i>but their reunion would be short- lived.

195
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,890
<i>She had been run down by 
a car in Los Angeles,

196
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,440
<i>and Ben claimed he had proof 
that Widmore was responsible.

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,610
Why would these people 
want to murder her?

198
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,630
I don't know, but they did.

199
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,250
and so an alliance was born.

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,250
<i>Sayid became an assassin for Ben, 
exacting vengeance 

201
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,490
Who is next?

202
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,220
Good morning.

203
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,800
Is this your first time in the Seychelles?

204
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,020
<i>Sayid went on killing...

205
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,040
<i>until there was no one left.

206
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,100
You've taken care of everyone 
who posed a threat to your friends.

207
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,920
It's been a pleasure working with you, Sayid.

208
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,930
That's it? What I do now?

209
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,070
I suppose you should go live your life.

210
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,440
You're free, Sayid.

211
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,280
<i>Shortly after the rescue, Kate fulfilled the promise
... she made to wyer on the chopper.

212
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,100
Hey, Cassidy.

213
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,330
Oh, my God! I saw you on the news.

214
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,660
What are you doing here?

215
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,510
Sawyer sent me.

216
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,520
<i>Kate knew Cassidy before the crash, but neither 
were aware they shared another connection.

217
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,330
What a coward.

218
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,070
He was trying to do the right thing.

219
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,850
He was trying to get away from you.

220
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,320
I told him he had a daughter.

221
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,080
He never so much as lifted 
a finger to try to call her.

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,380
So, now I'm supposed to think he's a hero 
because he told you to come here and help us?

223
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,110
Hell, I bet this money's not even his, is it?

224
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,580
My father couldn't stand eulogies.

225
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,270
"The only good thing about a wake 
is the free booze," he'd say.

226
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,780
<i>For Jack,coming home provided him the opportunity 
to say good- bye to his father Christian

227
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,990
<i>who died in Sydney.

228
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,340
I loved you. I miss you.

229
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,300
<i>But a visitor from Australia came 
to the service with shocking news for Jack.

230
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,180
My father didn't have a daughter.

231
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,810
Yes, he did.

232
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,190
She was on your plane, too.

233
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,550
Her name was Claire.

234
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,070
<i>Claire's mother was unaware 
that Aaron was her grandson,

235
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,930
<i>but Jack and Kate were left stunned.

236
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,530
<i>When Kate was tried for 
the murder of her abusive father...

237
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,070
The defense calls dr. Jack Shephard 
to the witness stand.

238
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,450
<i>... Jack was there for her.

239
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,470
I only have one question for you.

240
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,750
Do you love the defendant?

241
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,180
No.

242
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
Not anymore.

243
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,850
<i>The charges against Kate 
were dropped.

244
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,850
I just wanted to tell you that 
what I said in there...

245
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,780
I didn't mean it.

246
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,880
"... and yesterday, things went on 
just as usual."

247
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,070
<i>Jack moved in with Kate and Aaron.

248
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,640
<i>It seemed that all were happy... 
a family.

249
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm so glad that you're here.

250
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,320
Me, too.

251
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,930
Do you really think that I'm good at this?

252
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,880
Yeah.

253
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,440
You're good at this.

254
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,730
Will you marry me?

255
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,420
Of course I will.

256
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,820
<i>Kate was happy to begin a new life.

257
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,040
He's refusing to take his meds,
and he's stopped sleeping.

258
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,750
<i>But Hurley's encounters 
with dead friends continued,

259
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,010
<i>and one gave him a message 
to pass on to Jack.

260
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,840
You're not supposed to raise him, Jack.

261
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,450
Do you think he means Aaron?

262
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,140
Take your meds, Hurley.

263
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,680
Just take 'em.

264
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,400
Hey, Jack! Charlie said someone's 
gonna be visiting you, too.

265
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,570
Soon.

266
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,860
<i>Jack slowly began to lose control...

267
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,590
Jack?

268
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,360
<i>... and for good reason...
he saw his dead father.

269
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,220
<i>Jack began drinking and taking pills

270
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,800
<i>and to make matters worse...

271
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I gotta go. Jack's home.

272
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
<i>He stopped trusting Kate.

273
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,780
Why won't you tell me?

274
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,870
Because he wouldn't want me to.

275
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,070
<i>The promise she made to Sawyer 
was coming between them

276
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,640
<i>and ultimately brought their 
relationship to an end.

277
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,560
I'm the one who saved you.

278
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,290
You can't do this. All right?

279
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,430
'cause I can't have you like this 
around my son.

280
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:35,290
You're not even related to him!

281
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,650
And what was this thing before 
you guys blew it up?

282
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,120
A Dharma station.

283
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,930
For what?

284
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,990
There was a man named Desmond 
living down in it.

285
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,340
He was pushing a button every 
108 minutes to save the world.

286
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,320
- Really?
- Really.

287
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,530
<i>The survivors left behind on the island...

288
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,160
Son of a...

... bitch.

291
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,370
<i>When Ben turned the wheel below
the Orchid station to move the island,

292
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,340
<i>it caused a serious side effect.

293
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,750
Oh, no!

294
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,290
<i>The Oceanic survivors and the scientists 
from the freighter began flashing through time.

295
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,150
Whatever Ben Linus did, 
I think dislodged us.

296
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,850
Dislodged us from what?

297
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,380
Time.

298
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,070
<i>They flashed to numerous time 
periods on the island

299
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,180
<i>and met the others in the 1950s.

300

Your name is Widmore?

Charles Widmore?

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,220
<i>led him directly to a confrontation 
with Charles Widmore.

319
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,540
I need to know where I can find 
Daniel Faraday's mother.

320
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,180
I haven't seen or heard from 
my daughter for three years.

321
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,810
Just answer me this: is she safe?

322
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,420
Where's Faraday's mother?

323
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,540
She's in Los Angeles.

324
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,480
<i>But on the island, the flashes continued.

325
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,140
Turn around slowly.

326
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,290
Jin?

327
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,650
- Sawyer?
- Jin!

328
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:55,480
<i>Jin survived the freighter explosion and 
had been flashing through time as well.

329
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,870
Where is Sun?

330
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,980
Hey, John.

331
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,780
<i>Richard Alpert found Locke and told him 
the only way to stop the flashes

332
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,330
<i>was to bring back those 
who'd left the island.

333
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,300
How am I supposed to do that?

334
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,680
You're gonna have to die, John.

335
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,530
We have to go back to The Orchid.

336
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,560
Excuse me?

337
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,710
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

338
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,370
<i>Locke returned to the location 
of the Orchid station.

339
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,050
Hello, John.

340
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,290
What are you doing down here?

341
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,380
I'm here to help you the rest of the way.

342
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,620
<i>And he turned the same wheel 
that Ben turned.

343
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,170
Say hello to my son.

344
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,340
<i>In the process, the time flashes stopped.

345
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,050
I think it's over. I think John did it.

346
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,940
Now what?

347
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,450
Now we wait for him to come back.

348
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,930
<i>But Sawyer and his group were left 
stranded on the island in 1974,

349
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,810
<i>and they had no choice 
but to join the Dharma Initiative.

350
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,720
<i>Locke was transported three years 
into the future...

351
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,180
<i>to the tunisian desert, where he was soon 
found by men working for Charles Widmore.

352
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,230
I met you when I was 17.

353
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,840
How long has it been for you 
since we first met?

354
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,140
Four days.

355
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,880
That's incredible.

356
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,200
<i>Widmore wanted to find the island,
so he helped Locke in any way he could.

357
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,990
The folder contains your people's 
whereabouts,

358
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,980
everyone that was on the island that left.

359
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,870
Mira. Tienes un visitante.
(Look. You've a visitor)

360
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,450
<i>But Locke's task would prove 
to be difficult.

361
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,240
I know how it sounds, Sayid,
but you have to trust me.

362
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm not going back.

363
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,090
Hello, Hugo.

364
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,310
Hey, Susie, am I talking to a dude 
in a wheelchair right now?

365
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,230
Yep.

366
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,660
Whoa, dude!

367
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,040
I need you to come back to the island with me.

368
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,300
- What?
- And not just you, but everybody who left.

369
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,470
No, I'm not going anywhere with you!

370
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,860
- Kate, I don't think you understand...
- No, you made yourself perfectly clear,

371
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,500
and the answer is no.

372
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,050
<i>Locke grew discouraged, but his 
situation soon became dangerous.

373
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,240
<i>this turn of fate gave Locke 
another chance to prove his case.

374
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,440
What are you doing here?

375
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,060
We have to go back.

376
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,160
Of course we do.

377
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,480
Jack, the people I left behind 
need our help.

378
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,730
We're supposed to go back.

379
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,230
Because it's our destiny.

380
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,310
How many times are you gonna 
say that to me, John?

381
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,090
Good-bye, John.

382
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,430
Your father says hello.

383
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,050
What?

384
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,940
The man who told me how to bring you all back... 
he said to tell his son hello.

385
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,400
He said his name was Christian.

386
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,030
My father is dead.

387
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,460
He didn't look dead to me.

388
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,520
You leave me alone, and you 
leave the rest of 'em alone!

389
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>Locke had failed, and for him, 
there was only one option.

390
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,300
Wait, please. John, stop!

391
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,350
What... what are you doing here?

392
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,180
- John, just calm down.
- What do you want from me?

393
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,160
- Please, let me help.
- Answer the question!

394
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,030
I'm trying to protect you!

395
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,810
No! Widmore came to me.

396
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,930
- He saved me.
- No, John, he used you.

397
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,990
Charles Widmore is the reason
I moved the island

398
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,400
to keep him away so
that you could lead.

399
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,410
I can't lead anyone.

400
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,610
I couldn't get any of them.

401
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,220
I couldn't get a single one of them 
to come back with me.

402
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,530
- Jack booked a ticket.
- What?

403
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,340
A plane ticket from Los Angeles 
to Sydney... tonight.

404
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,940
Whatever you said to him, John,
it worked.

405
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,120
And if you got Jack, 

406
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,910
I know we can do this, John.

407
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,890
You haven't even been to Sun yet.

408
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,890
Let's start with her.

409
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,140
I promised Jin that I wouldn't 
bring her back.

410
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,800
Jin is alive?

411
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,920
He wanted me to tell her that 
his body washed up on the beach.

412
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,970
He gave me his wedding ring 
to prove it.

413
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,450
All right.

414
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:11,370
I don't know where we go from there,
but we'll figure something out.

415
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,470
I know where we go.

416
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,790
There's a woman here 
in Los Angeles... Eloise Hawking.

417
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,420
Eloise Hawking?Are you sure?

418
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,390
Yeah, why? Do you know her?

419
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,900
Yes, John.

420
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,610
I know her.

421
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,800
I'll miss you, John. I really will.

422
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
<i>Jack began taking frequent trips
across the Pacific...

423
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,900
Excuse me. Can I get another one 
of those, please?

424
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
How about a newspaper instead?

425
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>And during one flight home,
he learned that Locke was dead.

426
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,800
<i>for the first time, Jack reazed that
he and Locke need one another,

427
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,600

was on the island.

428
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,100
Hello? It's me.

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I just need to see you.

430
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,100
Why did you call me, Jack?

431
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,800
- Been flying a lot.
- Why?

432
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,600
Because I want it to crash, Kate.

433
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:34,300
I actually close my eyes, 
and I pray that I can get back.

434
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,200
I have to go.

435
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,000
We were not supposed to leave.

436
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,200
Yes, we were.

437
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,500
Good- bye, Jack.

438
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,700
We have to go back, Kate.

439
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
"We have to go back"?

440
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,500
I spent the last three years trying 
to forget all of the horrible things 

441
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,500
that happened on the day that we left.

442
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,000
How dare you ask me to go back?

443
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,900
<i>But Jack wouldn't let go,
and he soon found an unlikely ally.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,200
Hello, Jack.

445
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,700
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

446
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Did he tell you that I was off the island?

447
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,700
Yes, he did. He told me

448
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,200
that after I left the island,
some very bad things happened,

449
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
and he said that I had to come back.

450
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm here to tell you that the island
won't let you come alone.

451
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
All of you have to go back.

452
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,900
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

453
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Sayid had no intention of returning 
to the island.

454
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,900
<i>But with Locke dead, he was 
serious about protecting his friends.

I want you to come with me.

456
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,900
- We're not going back, are we?
- No.

457
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Just somewhere safe.

458
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,500
Wait here.

459
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Hey, he's got a gun! Come on!  
Get out of here!

460
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,600
I thought it was supposed 
to be a safe house.

461
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,600
<i>Jack found new purpose and joined Ben to
convince his friends to return to the island.

00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
<i>Jack brought Sayid to the hospital

All right. Sayid, you've been attacked.

469
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,800

- At his parents' house.

470

Hello, Hugo.

471
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
Get away from me.

to go back to the island.

475
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,200
If you come with me, you won't ever
have to lie again. Let me help you.

476
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,200
Never, dude.

477
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,400
hey, you got me! that's right! You got me!

478
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,700
That's right! I killed 'em. I killed 'em all.

479
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,900
Just get me away from here.

480
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
<i>Ben's plan was in jeopardy.

481
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,000
Hello. Who's there?

482
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,200
<i>But Kate's problems were just beginning.

483
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,200
You have to go back.

484
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,400
Don't move. Don't you touch my son!

485
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,800
Claire?

486
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,300
You can't bring him back, Kate.

487
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,900
Don't you dare bring him back!

488
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,900
<i>And her fears... were soon valited.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,900
Miss Austen? we're here to get a blood sample
from you and one from your son Aaron.

490
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,100
Why?

491
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,000
To determine your relationship to the child.

492
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,400
- Please, may we come in?
- Get off my property.

493
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,900
If you won't comply, then I'm going to
have to come back with the sheriff.

494
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,100
Then come back with the sheriff.

495
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,700
<i>The possibility of losing Aaron
had become a reality for Kate.

496
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,400
<i>and as she set out to find answers,
Jack was there to help.

497

- Somebody wants Aaron.
- What?

498
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,978
There's a lawyer in there. 

499
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,522
His clients... they know we're lying,
and they're gonna take him away.

500
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,600
Look, I gotta go, all right? Get in or don't.

501
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,300
<i>The path led them to a motel room
occupied by claire's mother...

Oh, my god.

503
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,700
<i>who was presumably in L.A. to take her grandson
away from Kate. So Jack made an appeal.

504
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Ms. Littleton, I understand
that you feel the need to do this.

505
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,000
but I need you to know that everything that
Kate and I have done, it was for Aaron.

506
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,200
Who's Aaron?

507
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
<i>It was clear that Slaire's mother
was not after Aaron.

508
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
<i>But that night, Kate would learn who was.

509
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,300
- Hello, Kate.
- It's okay. He's with me.

510
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,000
He's with you?

511
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,200
He's here to help us,
to help everyone that we left behind.

512
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,500
It's him... he's the one who's 
trying to take Aaron.

513
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,800
No, you... you don't understand.

514
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,400
No, Jack, she's right.

515
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,200
<i>Sun was ready to exact the revenge
she long sought for jin's death.

516
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,700
Who the hell do you think you are?
Why don't you leave me and my son alone?

517
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Because he's not your son, Kate.

518
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,700
- Move away, Kate.
- Sun, what are you doing?

519
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,200
- Sun... 
- I said move away!

520
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,900
Sun, listen. I know you think you're helping...

521
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,800
If it wasn't for you, Jin would still be alive.

522
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,300
I didn't kill your husband, Sun,
because he's not dead.

523
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,200
- You're lying.
- No, Sun.

524
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,700
How do you know he's alive?

525
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,800
There's someone here in Los Angeles. Let me
take you to them, and I'll show you the proof.

526
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,700
Someone? Who?

527
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
The same person that's gonna show us
how to get back to the island.

528
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,500
Is that what this is about?

529
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,100
This is insane. You guys are crazy.

530
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,600
- Kate... 
- Jack, don't!

531
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,500
Sayid, where are you going?

532
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
I don't want any part of this.

533
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,300
And if I see you or him again...
it'll be extremely unpleasant for all of us.

534
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,500
What's a glass of that run you?

535
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,100
Whatever it is, it's worth it.

536
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,500
I don't understand why someone would
pay 120 bucks for a glass of anything.

537
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,300
If you knew what my drink cost,
why did you ask me?

538
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
You so much as flinch and you're dead.

539
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,200
I was hired to bring you to guam.

540
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
Who hired you?

541
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,300
The family of Peter Avellino...

542
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,100
the man you killed in cold blood last year
on a golf course in the Seychelles.

543
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,500
You're going to answer
for what you've done.

544
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,700
Take it.

545
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,000
<i>Before Ben brought 
Jack and Sun to Eloise Hawking,

546
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,000
<i>he provided Sun with proof 
that Jin was alive.

547
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,900
John gave it to me.

548
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
Why didn't Locke tell me himself?

549
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:13,800
I don't know, but all those people back
on the island, Jin included, need our help.

550
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,100
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

551
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
What are you doing here?

552
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,600
I assume the same thing you are.

553
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,800
You're looking for Faraday's mother, too?

554
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Eloise Hawking 
was Daniel Faraday's mother

555
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,100
and the person who knew how to
get the Oceanic Six back to the island.

556
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
What is this place?

557
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,900
The Dharma Initiative called 
the lamp post.

558
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,800
This is how they found the island.

559
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,700
547
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:05,000
<i>She explained that the island 
was always moving.

560
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:54,200
<i>Consequently, the group had a very small 
window of opportunity find their way back.

561
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,600
There's a commercial airliner
flying from Los Angeles to Guam...

562
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,700
Ajira Airways Flight 3- 1- 6.

563
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,700
It must be that plane.

564
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,300
Excuse me. Am I really hearing this?
You're all going back to the island? Willingly?

565
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Yes.

566
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,900
I came here to deliver a message.

567
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,800
Daniel Faraday sent me here.

568
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,900
He wanted me to tell you that he
and all the people on the island need your help.

569
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,400
But I am helping,dear.

570
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,000
Consider the message delivered.

571
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,800
So that's it. We just get on that flight,
and we just and hope that it works?

572
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
No, that's not all, Jack.

573
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,400
What's this?

574
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,500
It's John Locke's suicide note.

575
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,100
He is going to lp you get back.
John is going to be a substitute.

576
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,800
A substitute for who?

577
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,800
You need to, as best you can,
recreate the conditions of the original flight,

578
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,000
which is why you need to give
John something of your father's.

579
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,500
That's what you have to do.

580
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,800
This is ridiculous.

581
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is,

582
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:08,300
and start asking yourself whether
or not you believe it's going to work.

583
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,500
<i>Jack was not entirely comfortable
taking such a leap of faith,

584
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,900
<i>but when he paid a visit to his grandfather,
he made a timely discovery.

585
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
- Are these yours, granddad?
- Those were your father's.

586
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,300
<i>For Kate, a return to the island
was the furthest thing from her mind.

587

Aaron? Aaron? Aaron!

588
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,900
<i>But when she nearly lost Aaron 
in a supermarket,

589
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Is this your mommy?

590
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,600
<i>she began to question if she was
the right person to be his mother.

591
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,100
As scared as I was, all I could 
think was, it's about time.

592
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,500
I mean, why would I expect him
to be taken?

593
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,400
Because you took him,Kate.

594
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,100
I had to take him. he needed me.

595
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,400
You need him.

596
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Sawy broke your heart.
How else were you supposed to fix it?

597
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Mrs. littleton, I'm Kate austen.

598
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,600
I know who you are.

599
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,600
<i>Though it was the hardest decision of her life,
Kate knew what needed to be done.

600
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
He's waiting for you.

601
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,500
I told him that you're his grandmother,

602
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,500
that you'll take care of him
while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.

603
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Where are you going?

604
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,200
I'm going back to find your daughter.

605
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,500
Kate? What are you doing here?

606
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,200
- Are you still going back to the island?
- Yeah.

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,600
Then I'm going with you.

608
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,700
- Where's Aaron? Where... 
- Don't ask questions.

609
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,900
If you want me to go with you, you will never
ask me about Aaron. 

610
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,800
Do you understand, Jack?

611
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,100
- Yes.
- Thank you.

612
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,500
<i>The next morning, Ben prepared to
even the score with Charles Widmore.

613

Charles? It's Benjamin.

614

How did you get this number?

615
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,700
It doesn't matter. What matters is,
I'm going back to the island today.

616

The island won't let you come back. 
Trust me.

617

Just as soon as I do one thing... 
kill your daughter.

I've been, uh, sidetracked,

626
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,400
and I need you to pick up Locke's body
and take it to the airport. Please.

627
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,500
Wherever you are, John,
you must be laughing your ass off,

628
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,500
'cause this is even crazier than you were.

629
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,800
I've already heard everything 
you had to say, John.

630
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,000
You wanted me to go back. 
I'm going back.

631
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,800
Rest in peace.

632
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,200
mr. Shephard, the reason for
transporting mr. Bentham to Guam?

633
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Uh, these were his wishes.

634
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,700
I have to inform you that due 
to the increased security measures,

635
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,100
we are required to open the casket 
and perform a screening. 

636
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Do you understand, Mr. Shephard?

637
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,600
Yes. Yes. I understand.

638
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,200
Please remove all jackets, sweaters,
jewelry and footwear.

639
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,800
- Jack.
- Sun. Hey.

640
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,300
I thought maybe you might 
change your mind.

641
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,100
if there is even a chance that Jin is alive,
I have to be on that plane.

642
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,700
<i>This group who came home
was coming together again...

643
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,500
<i>each for very different reasons.

644
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,500
Are you sure we're going to Guam?

645
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,000
Where else would we be going?

646
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,200
Hurley, what are you doing here?
How did you know about the...

647
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,500
All that matters is that I'm here, right?

648
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,700
Can I ask you a favor?
Can we get the next plane?

649
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,100
This is the plane we're taking.

650
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,600
Welcome to Ajira Air. Thank you, sir.

651
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,000
Welcome aboard, ma'am. Absolutely...

652
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,100
- You made it.
- Yeah.

653
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,100
Hold up! Wait, please.

654
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,500
- Thank you for not closing it.
- Oh, that's okay.

655
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
Wait!  What's he doing here?

656
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,200
- Hurley...
- No, no! He can't come!

657
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,200
If you want to get back,
this is how it's gonna have to be.

658
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,900
- Are you working for Benjamin Linus?
- Who's Benjamin Linus?

659
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
He's a monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

660
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,200
Why would I work for somebody like that?

661
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,800
I did.

662
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,400
Is everything okay?

663
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,400
Yes. Yes, everything's fine. Right?

664
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes, Jack, I'll be fine.

665
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,000
- It's pretty crazy, huh?
- Which part?

666
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:41,300
You don't think it means something
that somehow we're all back together?

667
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,800
We're on the same plane, Jack.
Doesn't make us together.

668
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,200
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
this is your captain Frank J. Lapidus,

669
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,500
and on behalf of the entire flight crew,
welcome aboard.

670
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,500
- Well, hello, doc.
- What are you doing here, Frank?

671
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Oh, I fly this route all the time.
Sometimes I take the big birds into New-Delhi.

672
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,600
Is that Sayid... and Hurley?

673
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,400
Wait a second. We're not going 
to Guam, are we?

674
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,000
<i>It seemed that destiny was
calling this group back to the island,

675
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,500
<i>and Jack could only hope this leap of faith
would make things right again.

676
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,900
Jack, I wish you had believd me. J.L.

677
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,100
- You all right there, Frank?
- I'm just fine.

678
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,800
Dude? You might want to fasten 
your seat belt.

679
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I have the controls.

680
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,100
Is that a runway?

681
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,500
Massive instrument failure!
We're putting her down!

682
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,900
Mayday, mayday, mayday! 
This is Ajira 3- 1- 6...

683
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
Brace for impact!

684
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,100
Hey.

685
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,700
<i>The Oceanic Six made it 
back to the island...

686
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,400
- Frank?
- Sun.

687
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,100
- Are you all right?
- Oh, my God. What happened?

688
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,000
I don't know.

689
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,600
690
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,900
Where's everyone else?

690
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,200
<i>With one group in 2007...

691
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,800
- Where did they go?
- They're gone.

692
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Gone where?

693
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
How would I know?

694
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,400
<i>... and the other in 1977.

695
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,200
Anyone?!

696
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,100
Help!

697
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,700
Dude.

698
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,400
Jin?

699
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,900
What? Wait. What?

700
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,900
No. Don't bring them in.

701
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,300
Just meet me in the north valley.

702
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,100
Who was it?

703
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,500
James. What's going on?

704
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
I gotta go.

705
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,500
Dude! I can't believe it!

706
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,700
Easy on the ribs there, kong.

707
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,700
- I actually missed that.
- Missed you,too,Hugo.

708
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,500
- Sawyer.
- Doc.

709
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,600
- Good to see you, Kate.
- You, too, James.

710
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,600
So what's up with you guys
in the old Dharma jumpsuits?

711
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
We're in the Dharma Initiative.

712
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,900
They came back to the island?

713
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,300
No. We came back, and so did you.

714
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,200
It's 1977.

715
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,300
All right, listen, you're all gonna be
the second batch of recruits

716
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
coming in off a sub rolling
into port right about now.

717
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,400
So we ain't got much time.

718
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,700
You want us to say we came in on the sub?
How's that gonna work?

719
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Everyone gets knocked out before the trip,
so no one meets each other until we process 'em.

720
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,500
Your name's gonna be on the list.

721
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,700
So when you get in there,
just wait for 'em to call your name.

722
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,600
When they do, just smile, step up,
take your jumpsuits and work assignments.

723
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,700
Okay, ready? 
Everybody say, "Namaste."

724
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
Namaste.

725
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
<i>30 years in the future,

726

trying to sort through a mystery of their own.

Hello. My name is Caesar. What's yours?
