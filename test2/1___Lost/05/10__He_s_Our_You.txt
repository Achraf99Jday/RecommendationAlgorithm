1
00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:02,365
Previously on <i>Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:03,441
Are you one of them?

3
00:00:03,522 --> 00:00:04,972
- One of who?
- A hostile.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,580
- What's your name?
- Ben.

5
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:07,928
Take me with you.

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,666
If that's what you really want, Ben.
If that's what you want.

7
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,358
I want you to think about that.

8
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:17,014
And you're gonna have to be
very, very patient.

9
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:20,172
You wanna protect your friends
or not, Sayid?

10
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:24,276
I'm Sayid Jarrah,
one of the Oceanic Six.

11
00:00:36,823 --> 00:00:38,924
Stop right there!

12
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:42,995
Sayid?

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,398
Jin.

14
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,600
Shut up! Get down.

15
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:51,070
Say another word,
and you're dead.

16
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:54,340
I brought you a sandwich.
Are you a hostile?

17
00:00:54,374 --> 00:00:56,842
- Do you think I am?
- What's your name?

18
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,277
Sayid.

19
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:00,179
I'm Ben.

20
00:01:01,848 --> 00:01:04,783
It's nice to meet you, Ben.

21
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,759
Hey, Phil.

22
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:27,960
Hey.

23
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:31,697
I brought another sandwich for him.

24
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,265
Chicken salad this time.

25
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,601
Yeah, I don't think
it's the menu.

26
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,936
He's not eating.
Save yourself the trouble, kid.

27
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:39,972
But Horace told me to.

28
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,441
Why does he care so much?
The guy's a hostile.

29
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:45,778
- That doesn't mean he's not hungry.
- Whatever.

30
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,386
I brought you a sandwich.

31
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,461
And a book.

32
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:04,496
I read it twice.

33
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:05,631
It's good.

34
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,966
Thank you.

35
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,569
Did Richard send you?

36
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,007
Richard.

37
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,709
He's your leader, right?

38
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,581
It's just a camera.

39
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:25,217
They can see,
but they can't hear.

40
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,588
Four years ago,
I ran away into the jungle,

41
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,256
and Richard found me.

42
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,258
I said I wanted to leave,

43
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:36,328
that I wanted to join you.

44
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,831
So I've been patient.

45
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,203
And if you're patient, too,

46
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,238
I think I can help you.

47
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:56,064
Lost SO5E10:
"He's Our You"

48
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:23,555
How'd it go?

49
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,358
He tried to bribe me.

50
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:29,161
- It didn't work.
- Of course it didn't.

51
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,396
Where to now?

52
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,732
Nowhere.

53
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,034
- You're done.
- What do you mean, I'm done?

54
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,603
<i>We're</i> done.

55
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:39,671
Andropov was the last one.

56
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,673
You've taken care of everyone

57
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,343
who posed a threat to your friends.

58
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:47,212
It's been a pleasure
working with you, Sayid.

59
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:51,583
So that's it?

60
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:54,653
I killed all those people for you,

61
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,389
and now you're just...
w- walking away?

62
00:06:57,423 --> 00:06:59,825
You didn't kill them
for <i>me,</i> Sayid.

63
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:02,294
<i>You're</i> the one
that asked for their names.

64
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:06,331
There's no one else
in Widmore's organization

65
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,901
that we need to go after.

66
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,536
Congratulations.

67
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,172
Mission accomplished.

68
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,174
What do I do now?

69
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:19,344
I suppose you should
go live your life.

70
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,814
You're free, Sayid.

71
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,737
Put out your hands.

72
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,274
Come on.

73
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:03,822
Thank you.

74
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:06,725
It's nice to finally
hear your voice.

75
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,462
I'm Horace.

76
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,268
Now's the part
where you tell me <i>your</i> name.

77
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:22,641
I need you to tell me what you
were doing out in that jungle.

78
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:26,645
- Ask him about the model. I-
- Radzinsky. I got this.

79
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:31,783
Those handcuffs-

80
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:36,521
Are you having some kind
of problem with your people?

81
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,424
Because either you were
in some kind of disagreement,

82
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,860
which makes me wanna help you,

83
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,096
or you're a spy
trying to infiltrate us.

84
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:47,966
So which is it?

85
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,744
Okay.

86
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:03,682
I'm gonna give you
an hour to decide

87
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:06,451
whether you wanna talk to me.

88
00:09:06,486 --> 00:09:09,688
But if you decide
you don't want to...

89
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:13,592
then I'm gonna have to take this
to the next level.

90
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,049
I think your bacon's ready.

91
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,383
Oh.

92
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:40,185
I forgot.

93
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,721
What's on the TV?

94
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:54,499
It's over, isn't it?

95
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:56,201
What's over?

96
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,036
This.

97
00:09:58,071 --> 00:10:00,238
Us... playing house.

98
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:01,940
All of it.

99
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,445
I never actually thought
they'd come back.

100
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:08,780
So they're back.
Nothing's changed.

101
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,283
What if Sayid tells them
who he is?

102
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:13,352
Sayid ain't sayin' nothin'.

103
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,622
Hey.

104
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:20,692
I got this under control.

105
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,800
Morning, H.

106
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,302
- Jim.
- What's up?

107
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:32,270
- Juliet.
- Horace.

108
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:35,440
I just spoke to the prisoner.
We have a problem.

109
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:41,980
- Why? What'd he say?
- Nothing, which is what worries me.

110
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:44,616
We need to find out
why he violated the truce,

111
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,252
why the hell he would
come into our territory.

112
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:50,188
I'm just gonna have to have
Oldham do his thing on him.

113
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,493
That psychopath? No way!

114
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:57,963
What choice do I have?

115
00:10:57,997 --> 00:11:00,732
Just let me
have go at him alone.

116
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:03,301
Be my guest,
but I'm telling you, man,

117
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:05,237
he is not gonna talk.

118
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,672
Oh, he'll talk to <i>me. </i>

119
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:13,578
- Mr. LaFleur.
- Take your lunch, Phil.

120
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,982
You going back there alone?

121
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:19,117
Take your lunch, Phil.

122
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:21,053
Yes, sir.

123
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,394
How you doing?

124
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,396
A 12-year-old Ben Linus

125
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:33,965
brought me
a chicken salad sandwich.

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,269
- How do you <i>think</i> I'm doing?
- Sweet kid, huh?

127
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:39,571
How can you live with him here?

128
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:42,441
'cause I ain't got a choice.

129
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:45,343
Is that so?

130
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:48,914
Let's see how <i>you</i> feel after
3 years of living in the '70s.

131
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,416
Lucky for you...

132
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,699
I spent that time getting myself

133
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,453
in a position to save your ass.

134
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,858
I'm sorry, Sayid.

135
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:10,102
- What are you doing?
- When I tell them I got your confession,

136
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,185
I need them to believe that
you didn't give it up easy.

137
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:12,771
What confession?

138
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:15,006
We're gonna say
you were trying to defect.

139
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,742
You were gonna offer
some intel on the others

140
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:18,850
In exchange for living with us.

141
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,545
And why in God's name
would I want to do that?

142
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,538
What the hell else
am I supposed to do with you?

143
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,515
Let me go.

144
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,151
And <i>then</i> what?
I can't just let you go.

145
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:27,352
Why not?

146
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:31,223
Because these people
trust me.

147
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,358
I've built a life here,
and a pretty good one.

148
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:36,628
I let you go,
all that goes away.

149
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:39,131
So you got yourself
a choice, chief.

150
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:41,800
Either you cooperate and join
the party in Dharmaville,

151
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,835
or you're on your own.

152
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:50,542
Then I guess I'm on my own.

153
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,682
Fresh off the griddle.

154
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:57,452
And don't forget
to try the dipping sauces.

155
00:12:57,586 --> 00:12:59,054
They really
bring out the ham.

156
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:00,789
Thanks, Hurley.

157
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:03,658
So...

158
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,127
What's going on with Sayid?

159
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,201
Don't know anything yet.

160
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:08,663
What do you mean,
you don't know anything?

161
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,299
I thought you were
at Sawyer's last night.

162
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,643
What did he tell you?

163
00:13:11,744 --> 00:13:13,635
He told me to leave him
alone and let him do his job.

164
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,403
And you're going to?

165
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:19,039
I'll talk to Juliet,
see what she can tell me.

166
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:21,975
Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you
anything, why would Juliet?

167
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,478
- Well, why wouldn't she?
- 'Cause they're together.

168
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:28,015
- What do you mean, they're together?
- "Together" as...

169
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,717
They live together.
Like, not as roommates.

170
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:33,220
You know, "together"
like you guys were.

171
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,725
I thought
it was kind of obvious.

172
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:39,594
- I mean, who couldn't see that comin'?
- Hurley.

173
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:50,304
Well, I guess I better...
Go make some more waffles.

174
00:13:53,341 --> 00:13:55,275
Did <i>you</i> know?

175
00:13:57,512 --> 00:13:59,446
Yeah.

176
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,448
Hmm.

177
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:26,173
You know what I can't figure out?

178
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,042
Is how the hell you got caught.

179
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,312
You hostiles are supposed
to be the kings of the jungle.

180
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:35,249
And how dumb are you that you
got captured by these idiots?

181
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:40,320
And yet <i>you're</i> the one
who mops up after them.

182
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:43,423
Yeah, well...

183
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,927
We'll see how cute you are once
Oldham gets done with you, pal.

184
00:14:54,903 --> 00:14:57,404
What the hell
are you doing here?

185
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:59,840
I was bringing you a sandwich.

186
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:01,141
A sandwich?

187
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:05,812
You never made me a sandwich
in your life.

188
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:08,615
Yeah, well...
I- I made one for myself...

189
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,551
Uh-huh.

190
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,003
So... So I just thought
that I'd bring you-

191
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:12,886
Oh, yeah? You just...

192
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:15,522
- Dad, don't!
- Don't you lie to me.

193
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:18,992
What are you doin' down here?

194
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:24,731
You made this sandwich for <i>him,</i>
didn't you?

195
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,767
- Hmm?
- Yes.

196
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:29,003
- Who told you to do that?
- Nobody.

197
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,105
- Nobody?
- I just thought that-

198
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:34,375
You "just thought," huh?

199
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,976
Go home.

200
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,346
Go on. I'll tell you
what to think.

201
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:23,424
How did you find me?

202
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,026
I looked.

203
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:28,328
What do you want, Ben?

204
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,931
John Locke is dead.

205
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,769
I think he was murdered.

206
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,539
Why would anyone kill him?

207
00:16:38,573 --> 00:16:40,541
I'd say it was retribution

208
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:43,677
for the work
you and I have been doing.

209
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,679
So you're in danger, Sayid.

210
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,982
If I can find you, so can
the people that found Locke.

211
00:16:49,017 --> 00:16:51,952
The same people who,
even as we speak,

212
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,755
are sitting outside
Hugo's mental institution.

213
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,757
They're watching him?

214
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,960
A man in a sedan
has been there all week,

215
00:16:59,994 --> 00:17:03,464
just waiting...

216
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:06,467
presumably for you or me
to show our faces.

217
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,470
And that's why you're here?

218
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:12,906
You actually came all this way
to suggest that I kill this man?

219
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,008
You don't <i>want</i> to?

220
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:18,245
What makes you think I <i>want</i> to?

221
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,647
Because, Sayid...

222
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,649
to put it simply,

223
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:25,452
you're capable of things
that most other men aren't.

224
00:17:25,487 --> 00:17:27,421
Every choice
you've made in your life,

225
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,890
whether it was
to murder or to torture,

226
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,160
it hasn't really
been a choice at all, has it?

227
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:35,596
It's in your nature.
It's what you are.

228
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,033
You're a killer, Sayid.

229
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:50,344
I'm not what you think I am.

230
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:54,615
I don't like killing.

231
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:58,018
Well, then I apologize.

232
00:17:58,052 --> 00:18:00,020
I was mistaken about you.

233
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:23,277
All right, last chance.

234
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,626
Take him to Oldham.

235
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,185
<i># I can't give you #</i>

236
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,888

<i># I've plenty of #</i>

241
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,133
Oldham.

242
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,468
<i># baby #</i>

243
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:24,204
Hey, man.
Are we ready?

244
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:27,307
<i># dream a while,</i>
<i>scheme a while #</i>

245
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:31,845

00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:35,949
<i># and I guess- #</i>

248
00:19:40,154 --> 00:19:42,589
Who is that man?

249
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:48,762
He's our <i>you. </i>

250
00:19:59,974 --> 00:20:02,876
Better put him
in the restraints.

251
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:29,569
They're for your protection.

252
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,773
There are side effects
to what I'm giving you.

253
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,043
Open his mouth.

254
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,647
Open up.

255
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,827
Don't be afraid.

256
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:56,830
Just turn your mind off.
Let it take effect.

257
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:03,470
It's beyond your control,

258
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,540
so fighting it is
a poor use of your energies.

259
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:09,209
You see,

260
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:13,447
whether you struggle or not,
one thing's for sure, friend.

261
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:18,186
You <i>will</i> tell us the truth.

262
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,388
There's somebody-
somebody here in Los Angeles.

263
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,790
- Let me take you to them.
- Who?

264
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,159
The same person
that's gonna show us

265
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:38,029
- how to get back to the island.
- Is that what this is about?

266
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,733
This is insane.
You are all crazy.

267
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,539
Sayid, where are you going?

268
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,274
I don't want any part of this.

269
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,510
And if I see <i>you</i> again,

270
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:55,746
it'll be extremely unpleasant
for us both.

271
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,291
Do you have a menu?

272
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,293
There you go.

273
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,262
Sir? Another MacCutcheon?

274
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:13,097
Please.

275
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,068
What's that run you?

276
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,569
Excuse me?

277
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:20,471
That scotch.

278
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,440
What's a glass of that run you?

279
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,178
Whatever it is, it's worth it.

280
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,846
I don't understand

281
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:32,483
why someone would pay 120 bucks
for a glass of anything.

282
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,689
If you knew what my drink cost,
why did you ask me?

283
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:48,966
Same reason I'm eating my dinner
here instead of a table.

284
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,402
I'll have the rib eye,
bloody.

285
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,371
Yes, ma'am.
Rib eye, bloody.

286
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,810
Are you a professional?

287
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,413
A professional what?

288
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,682
You think I'm a prostitute?

289
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,485
Mm.

290
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,388
I'm not a professional anything.
I just...

291
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,057
Thought you looked sad.

292
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,859
I like sad men.

293
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,395
I'm sorry to hear that.

294
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,636
So...

295
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,507
Other than drinking alone at bars...

296
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,110
what do you do?

297
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,745
For a living.

298
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,014
I'm between jobs
at the moment.

299
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,551
So what <i>did</i> you do?

300
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,155
The only thing
I was ever good at.

301
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,991
Then why did you quit?

302
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,727
I'm trying to change.

303
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,132
I know why you're sad now.

304
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,168
Do you?

305
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,137
When you are that good
at something,

306
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,506
there are always going to be people

307
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,943
who tempt you into staying the same.

308
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,851
And how do you know so much
about temptation?

309
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:20,057
Buy me a glass of that scotch,
and I'll tell you.

310
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:38,331
Hello there.

311
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:40,346
Hello?

312
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,418
I'm going to ask you
a few questions.

313
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,789
I want you to relax
and answer them truthfully...

314
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,426
Not that you'll have
any choice about it.

315
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,294
What is your name?

316
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,296
Sayid.

317
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,665
Sayid Jarrah.

318
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,869
All right, Sayid.

319
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,405
Why were you in handcuffs
when we found you?

320
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,640
Because...

321
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,278
because I am a bad man.

322
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,014
Were you running away
from your people?

323
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,549
What people?

324
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:19,850
The hostiles.

325
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,722
I am not a hostile.

326
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,024
Then where did you
come from, Sayid?

327
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,827
I came on a plane.

328
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,128
What plane?

329
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,764
Ajira flight 3-1-6.

330
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,300
And that's how
I returned to the island.

331
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,202
"Returned"?
You've been here before?

332
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,503
Oh, yes.

333
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,138
The first time,

334
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:43,441
I was
on Oceanic flight 8-1-5.

335
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,476
It crashed.

336
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,978
I was here
for a hundred days.

337
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,647
Then I left.

338
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,918
Ask Sawyer.

339
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,886
- Who's "Sawyer"?
- Who cares?!

340
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,589
None of this matters.
Ask him about the Flame.

341
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,658
<i>Quiet. </i>

342
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,993
What do you know
about our stations here?

343
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,465
I know the Flame was
a communication station.

344
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,869
The Pearl was to observe
other stations.

345
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,638
The Swan was to study
electromagnetism.

346
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,013
But, of course, that was
before the incident-

347
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:17,875
The swan?!

348
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,112
How could he know what
we were gonna name it?

349
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,747
We haven't even built it yet!
I <i>told</i> you! He saw the model!

350
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,816
- You see?! He <i>is</i> a spy!
- Hey!

351
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:26,710
I knew it!

352
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,285
Radzinsky!
I'm not gonna tell you again.

353
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,353
Cool it.

354
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,059
You're all going to die,
you know.

355
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:37,962
What?

356
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,932
You're going to be killed.

357
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,340
How exactly
would you know this, Sayid?

358
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,509
Because I am
from the future.

359
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,616
Maybe I should've used
half a dropper.

360
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,051
Oops.

361
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:08,759
You...

362
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,395
You used exactly enough.

363
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:18,369
Bench grinder, lube equipment,
drill press over here.

364
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,838
Plugs, bearings,
sockets, ratchets here.

365
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,040
How are you
with a flat four engine?

366
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,725
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

367
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:27,678
No, not really.

368
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:28,879
It's okay.

369
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,885
Jack told you about us...

370
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,355
No. Hurley, actually.

371
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,097
It's kind of a relief, actually.

372
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,567
I wasn't quite sure
how to do it

373
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,903
without it sounding like
I was telling you to stay away.

374
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,205
It's fine.

375
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,801
All right...

376
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,769
What do we do with him?

377
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,105
We kill him.

378
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,377
Hold on a second.
We're not killing anyone, right?

379
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,212
He violated the truce.

380
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:38,048
What do you think <i>they</i> would do
if they caught one of <i>us?</i>

381
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,150
Since when did we start
acting like them?

382
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,586
- We're civilized.
- Yes, we are.

383
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,755
We have a rule of law.

384
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,259
And we've given him every
opportunity to defend himself.

385
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,729
Blah, blah, blah. Need I remind
you, this man's <i>seen</i> things?

386
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,932
He <i>knows</i> things.
There's nothing to talk about.

387
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,068
- He's a spy.
- You sure about that, Stu?

388
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,070
He was trying to escape
from the hostiles.

389
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,072
He obviously has problems
with his people.

390
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,041
Yeah, and sharing our secrets

391
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,677
are the quickest way for him
to solve those problems.

392
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,845
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little more time to consider.

393
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:09,913
Consider?

394
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,949
I mean, the longer
he's among us,

395
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,951
the-the more danger we're in.

396
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,787
I can talk to him, Horace.
I just need more time.

397
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,356
No, you <i>had</i> your chance, LaFleur!

398
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,092
Why are we on <i>your</i> clock, Radzinsky?

399
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,528
Horace, you've got to call
for a vote.

400
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,631
Either we make a decision,

401
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,934
or I call Ann Arbor...

402
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,337
and they make it for us.

403
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,040
Radzinsky's right.

404
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:39,143
Horace, please...

405
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:42,313
I can't...

406
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,816
I can't sleep
with one eye open.

407
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,152
We have a baby now.

408
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,187
We have to think about Ethan.

409
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,258
We have to think
about all the children here.

410
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,863
How are we going to feel safe
with this man around?

411
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,034
I don't know what he's up to,

412
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:07,471
but we can't keep him here.

413
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,644
We have no choice.

414
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,553
Okay.

415
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,089
Let's put it to a vote.

416
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,124
All in favor
of Radzinsky's solution,

417
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,792
raise your hand.

418
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,605
LaFleur?

419
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,546
I would really like to say
it's unanimous.

420
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:05,803
Mmm.

421
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,975
Just for the record,

422
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,578
I really was
just there for dinner.

423
00:31:13,612 --> 00:31:16,381
Are you afraid I'll get the wrong idea?

424
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,317
Mmm.

425
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:21,419
I think
it's too late for that.

426
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,264
Take it off.

427
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:54,819
You so much as flinch,
and you're dead.

428
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:57,055
So who are you?

429
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,524
You asked me earlier
if I was a professional.

430
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:02,660
I am a professional.
I was hired to bring you to Guam.

431
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:04,195
Who hired you?

432
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,397
The family of Peter Avellino-

433
00:32:06,432 --> 00:32:08,866
the man you killed
in cold blood last year

434
00:32:08,901 --> 00:32:11,603
on a golf course
in the Seychelles.

435
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:14,572
- You're a bounty hunter?
- Doesn't matter what I am.

436
00:32:14,607 --> 00:32:18,376
You're going to answer
for what you've done.

437
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,319
Hit me in the face.

438
00:32:28,354 --> 00:32:29,988
What?

439
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:33,525
Go on. You owe me one anyway,
so make it a good one.

440
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:36,862
Then I want you to take
these keys out of my pocket

441
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,364
and let yourself out.

442
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,617
The guard outside is Phil.
He's a dimwit, so I reckon

443
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:44,603
you can get his gun before
he even realizes you're out.

444
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,538
Just promise me
you won't shoot him.

445
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:50,241
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm fine right here.

446
00:32:50,276 --> 00:32:51,876
They're gonna kill you.

447
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,712
They just took a vote.
Even the new mom wants you dead.

448
00:32:54,747 --> 00:32:57,348
I'm going to stay here, James.

449
00:32:57,383 --> 00:32:59,951
This morning, you were
begging me to let you go.

450
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:02,420
- Why would you change your-
- Because...

451
00:33:02,454 --> 00:33:04,889
when I woke up in the jungle

452
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:09,427
and I realized I was
back on this island...

453
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:11,929
I felt there was
no purpose to it.

454
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:16,634
But now I know
exactly why I'm here.

455
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:19,203
To get shot? <i>Then</i> what?

456
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:23,608
You're out of your mind.

457
00:33:58,444 --> 00:33:59,777
Hey.

458
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:01,880
Hi.

459
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:09,954
Why'd you come back?

460
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:11,856
What?

461
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,425
Sayid just filled my ear

462
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,128
full of some crap
about his damn purpose,

463
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,730
and I wanna know...
Why'd y'all come back?

464
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,732
Uh...

465
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:22,200
<i>Why,</i> Kate?

466
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:29,440
I don't know why
everyone else came back.

467
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:31,509
I just know why I did.

468
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,082
What?

469
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:49,594
What the hell?!

470
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,643
Are you ok?

471
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:10,515
Craig! Grab a wrench, open those
valves. Get the hoses going.

472
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:12,118
Okay.

473
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:19,657
Erin, grab the fire gear!

474
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:21,726
Bill, go help Craig.

475
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:25,630
What the hell happened?

476
00:35:25,664 --> 00:35:28,866
Three years-no burning buses.
Y'all are back for <i>one day... </i>

477
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,068
Get on that hose.

478
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,080
Man this hose!

479
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,682
Push it out!

480
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:49,787
All security! All security!
This is LaFleur! We have a fire!

481
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,923
Everyone get to building 15 <i>now!</i>

482
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:53,958
Roger that. I'm on my way.

483
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:17,882
What happened
to your glasses?

484
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,283
My dad.

485
00:36:19,318 --> 00:36:21,385
For bringing me
the sandwich?

486
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,521
I know.

487
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:26,090
My father was a
hard man as well.

488
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:29,827
I really hate it here.

489
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:34,599
If I let you out...

490
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:39,770
will you take me with you,

491
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:41,606
to your people?

492
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:45,743
Yes, Ben, I will.

493
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,883
That's why I'm here.

494
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:57,039
<i>Attention, passengers. </i>

495
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,808
<i>Ajira Airways flight 3-1-6</i>
<i>to Honolulu and Guam... </i>

496
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,349
Are you sure
we're going to Guam?

497
00:37:09,384 --> 00:37:11,418
Where else would we be going?

498
00:37:20,727 --> 00:37:23,031
Can I ask you a favor?

499
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,899
Can we get the next plane?

500
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:27,301
Why?

501
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,636
I'm very superstitious
when it comes to flying.

502
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,740
I'll buy you a rabbit's foot
at the gift shop.

503
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:35,475
This is
the plane we're taking.

504
00:37:45,153 --> 00:37:48,689
Sorry about the handcuffs,
but at least we're in business.

505
00:37:48,824 --> 00:37:52,093
Hold up! Wait, please!
Thank you for not closing it.

506
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,904
What's he doing here?!
No, no, he can't come!

507
00:38:03,038 --> 00:38:05,473
Hurley, hey,
if you want to get back,

508
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,576
- this is how it's gonna have to be.
- Are you working for Benjamin Linus?

509
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,512
- What?
- Are you working for him?

510
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:13,180
Who's Benjamin Linus?

511
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:16,316
He's a liar, a manipulator...

512
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,720
a man who allowed
his own daughter to be murdered

513
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:20,488
to save himself...

514
00:38:20,622 --> 00:38:23,624
A monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

515
00:38:25,593 --> 00:38:28,996
Why would I work
for somebody like that?

516
00:38:30,498 --> 00:38:31,999
I did.

517
00:39:06,768 --> 00:39:09,169
Hide!

518
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,132
Jin?

519
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,634
Sayid.

520
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:46,039
What are you doing here?
How did you get out?

521
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:49,142
Sawyer let me go.
They were going to kill me.

522
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:50,844
What?

523
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:53,148
Attention. The prisoner escaped.

524
00:39:53,282 --> 00:39:55,717
The hostile is no longer
in custody. Be on the lookout.

525
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,990
He could be armed.

526
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,019
They don't know he released me.

527
00:39:59,154 --> 00:40:01,489
Please, Jin,
I need to keep moving.

528
00:40:01,923 --> 00:40:03,490
Okay.

529
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:05,525
Let me talk to him first.

530
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:13,100
- LaFleur, it's Jin here.
- Come in.

531
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,140
Whoa!

532
00:40:20,174 --> 00:40:22,743
Where'd you learn to do <i>that?</i>

533
00:40:23,278 --> 00:40:25,078
Come on.

534
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:28,015
We better go.
He called LaFleur.

535
00:40:34,289 --> 00:40:36,623
You were right about me.

536
00:40:36,658 --> 00:40:38,492
What?

537
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:41,128
I <i>am</i> a killer.

538
