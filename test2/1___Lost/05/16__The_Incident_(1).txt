Previously on Lost

00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,001
Dharma folks at the Swan work site

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:05,002
they're gonna drill into the ground

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,503
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:09,940
<i>and that will cause
your plane--</i>

6
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:16,500
Oceanic 815--
to crash on this island.
and just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,700
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

Mornin'

10
00:01:53,703 --> 00:01:55,703
Mind if I join you?

11
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:56,904
Please.

12
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:05,148
Want some fish?

13
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,084
Thank you. i just ate.

14
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,454
I take it you're here
'cause of the ship.

15
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,689
I am.

16
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,695
How did they find
the island?

17
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,665
You'll have to ask 'em
when they get here.

18
00:02:21,732 --> 00:02:24,233
I don't have to ask.

19
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,103
<i>you brought them here.</i>

20
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:32,275
<i>still trying to prove me wrong,
aren't you?
you are wrong.</i>

21
00:02:32,343 --> 00:02:34,177
Am i?

22
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:37,246
They come. they fight.

23
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:40,216
They destroy. they corrupt.

24
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:42,652
It always ends the same.

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,354
It only ends once.

26
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:49,025
Anything that happens
before that is just progress.

27
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,271
Do you have any idea
how badly i wanna kill you?

28
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,608
Yes.

29
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:08,645
One of these days,
sooner or later...

30
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:11,347
I'm going to find a loophole,
my friend.

31
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,217
Well, when you do,
i'll be right here.

32
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,356
Always nice
talking to you, jacob.

33
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:23,393
Nice talking to you, too.

Fine. i'll do it. but you're
gonna be lookout, okay?

39
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:21,655
Okay.

he's gonna farm the land

43
00:04:36,604 --> 00:04:39,372
All the way out to ames road.
yeah, i hear that, too.

What you kids got there?

50
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,093
Open your bag.

51
00:05:01,162 --> 00:05:03,030
(thermos rattles)

52
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,532
Mm-hmm.
where'd you get this?

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,268
Got it over there.
i know you.

54
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:12,339
You're diane austen's girl.
what's your name?
katie.

55
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:14,742
Well, katie, i'm calling
your mom, then the cops,

56
00:05:14,809 --> 00:05:18,678
Because i don't tolerate
stealing here. you understand?

57
00:05:18,747 --> 00:05:21,014
(man) no need to do that.

58
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,383
I'll pay for it.

59
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,485
I hope this is enough.

60
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:30,390
Well, long as somebody
pays for it,

61
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,193
Guess there's no harm done.

62
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,163
But i don't wanna
see you in here ever again

63
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,365
Without your parents.
you understand me?

64
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,103
Thanks, mister.

65
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,905
You're welcome.

66
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:49,143
You're not gonna
steal anymore, are you?

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,050
Be good, katie.

68
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,722
<i>(man) welcome aboard, everyone.</i>

69

74
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:18,205
Have a nice rest.
see you on the other side.
(click)

75
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,011
We have to get out of here.

76
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:25,578
"out of here"?

77
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,580
We're underwater.

78
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:31,351
What the hell are you doing
here? how'd you get caught?
i came back to get you.

79
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,854
Came back to get me for what?
where's jack?

80
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:37,858
Jack is on his way
to blow up a hydrogen bomb.

81
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:41,862
Why the hell
would he do that?
does it matter?
we have to stop him.

82
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,435
(sighs)

83
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:50,103
Sorry, i'm gonna pass.

84
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,105
Did you hear
what i just said?

85
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,142
Yeah, i heard you.
you just don't get it, kate.

86
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,912
We we happy in dharmaville
till y'all showed up.

87
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,049
But now that's all over.

88
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,517
So we're gonna
drink our o.j.

89
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,987
And take our chances
in the real world.

90
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:09,022
Jack wants
to blow up the island?

91
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:14,094
Good for jack.

92
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:17,564
Is there anything in there
about how we're supposed to move

93
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,067
A 10-ton bomb
across the island?

94
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:22,402
(sid) actually,
it's 20 tons.

95
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,704
Fortunately,
it seems that faraday

96
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:27,140
Never intended to freight
the device in its entirety.

97
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,175
What?

98
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:30,477
He lt
detailed instructions

99
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:33,080
On how to remove
the plutonium core...

100
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,783
And how to detonate it.

101
00:07:36,851 --> 00:07:38,886
Faraday told me
that we needed to wipe out

102
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,888
Some kind of pocket
of energy.

103
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:43,823
Is only part of the bomb
gonna be enough to do that?

104
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:46,393
The core itself is
a thermonuclear weapon.

105
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,863
It'll be more than enough.

106
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,434
Hey! hey! wait.

107
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:56,403
We sealed that thing up
20 years ago,

108
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,971
And we put it underground

109
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,473
Because it was
emitting radiation.

110
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,575
Does this sound like
a good idea to you, eloise?
richard--

111
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:07,014
You're pregnant.
which is exactly why we have
to help them see this through.

112
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:09,249
Once the core is removed,

113
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:10,317
Then what?

114
00:08:10,385 --> 00:08:12,286
Then we have
approximately two hours

115
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:15,488
To take it to the swan site.
two hours?

116
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:18,959
When faraday
returned to the island,

117
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:22,930
He was very explicit
about his timetable.

118
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:25,899
Well then...
we'd better get movin'.

119
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,906
(hammering and whirring)

120
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,179
(men shouting indistinctly)

121
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,148
Who stopped the damn drill?!

122
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,882
I did.

123
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:45,452
Why?
because when we passed
70 meters,

124
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,421
The drill temp went up
60 degrees,

125
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,423
And i didn't want it
to melt.

126
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,192
Well, pierre, that's why we have
a truck full of water.

127
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,527
So cool it down
and turn it on.

128
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:56,563
Stuart, we've just
evacuated the island

129
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,498
Of all nonessential
personnel.

130
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,500
We're in the midst
of a possible inrrection.

131
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,469
Do you really think
this is the ideal time

132
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:06,506
For your experiments?
i've been working
on this project for six years--

133
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:09,476
Designing a station
that'll be able

134
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:13,180
To manipulate electromagnetism
in ways we only dreamed of.
have you thought
about the consequences

135
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,315
Of drilling
into that pocket?!

136
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:19,252
We have no idea
what we are going to--
if edison was only worried
about the consequences,

137
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,621
We'd all still
be sitting in the dark.

138
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:23,656
I came to this island
to change the world, pierre.

139
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,892
<i>that's exactly what
i inte to to.</i>

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,228
Let's get it started!
(punches button)

141
00:09:28,296 --> 00:09:31,231
(drilling resumes)

142
00:10:02,796 --> 00:10:04,731
(locke) take five, everybody.

143
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,567
We still got a ways to go
to get to jacob's.

144
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,237
Who's jacob?

145
00:10:10,304 --> 00:10:12,839
He's in charge
of this island.

146
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,807
You said john was in charge.

147
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,277
No, i said
he was the leader--

148
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:20,047
A title that i've discovered
is incredibly temporary.

149
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,115
But everyone answers
to someone,

150
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:24,584
And the leader
answers to jacob.

151
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:26,286
What's he like?

152
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,558
I don't know, sun.
i've never met him.

153
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,004
You've been staring for
the last ten minutes, richard.

154
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,840
Is there something
you would like to ask me?

155
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:52,011
Ben told me that...
he strangled you.

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,415
That is my recollection,
yes.

157
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:57,417
He said he was sure
you were dead.

158
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,619
He saw your coffin
loaded onto that plane

159
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,322
That you came back on.
hoare you alive?

160
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,324
Well, you've been
on this island

161
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:06,759
Much longer than i have,
richard.

162
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,962
If anyone should have
an explanation,

163
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:12,399
I'd think it would be you.
yeah, i-i have been here
a long time, john,

164
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:14,701
And i've seen things
on this island

165
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,703
That i can barely describe.

166
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,172
But... i've never seen someone
come back to life.

167
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,842
And i've never seen anyone
who doesn't age.

168
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,844
It doesn't mean
it can't happen.

169
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,914
I'm this way
because of jacob.

170
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,916
And if i had to guess,

171
00:11:29,984 --> 00:11:32,486
He's the reason you're not
in that coffin anymore.

172
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,454
I agree completely,
richard.

173
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:38,191
That's why i'm doing this--
so i can thank him.

174
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,161
(sighs) and once i've done that,
we're gonna need to deal with

175
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,730
The rest of the passengers
from the ajira flight

176
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:45,698
That brought me here.

177
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:49,002
What do you mean, "deal with"?
you know what i mean.

178
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,440
Let's go!

179
00:12:18,966 --> 00:12:20,634
Untie the crates.

180
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:27,240
Why'd we even bring
this yahoo?
becae we might need him.

181
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:30,644
<i>for what? he didn't know
the answer to the question.</i>

182
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:33,146
That doesn't mean
he's not important.

183
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:35,248
What, you think
he's a candidate?

184
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,854
He's awake.

185
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:48,161
How long you been
listening to us?

186
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,864
Long enough to wonder what
the hell i'm a candidate for.

187
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:53,433
(grunts)

188
00:12:55,436 --> 00:12:58,238
Who the hell
are you people?
we're friends.

189
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:01,140
So you smack all your friends
in the face with a rifle,

190
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:03,577
Shove 'em in a boat
and kidnap 'em?

191
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,612
Only the ones we like.

192
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,917
(bram) let's go.

193
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:15,188
(grunts)

194
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,592
What's in the box?

195
00:13:23,797 --> 00:13:24,864
Your call.

196
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:31,771
Open it.

197
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:49,656
Terrific.

198
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,729
Need a pen, son?

199
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:47,067
Yeah. thanks.

200
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:52,206
There you go.

201
00:14:52,273 --> 00:14:53,941
You can keep it.

202
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:00,848
I'm very sorry about
your mother and father, james.

203
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,427
(bird calling)

204
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:18,298
Come on, jimmy. we gotta get
to the cemetery, okay?

205
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,668
What you writin'?

206
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,070
Nothin'.

207
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:31,245
"dear mr. sawyer,

208
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:34,381
"you don't know who i am,
but i know who you are,

209
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:36,483
And i know what you done."

210
00:15:43,658 --> 00:15:45,725
Listen to me, jimmy.

211
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,360
I know you're angry

212
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:50,330
At the manhat did this
to your mamand daddy.

213
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:53,433
And hell,
you got every right to be.

214
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,270
But you gotta move on, boy.

215
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,038
They're gone,

216
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:02,542
And there ain't nothin'
you can do to change that.

217
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,346
What's done is done.

218
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:12,385
Now promise me you're not gonna
finish that letter.

219
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:17,024
I promise.

220
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,159
Good.

221
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:23,931
Come on.
let's go say good-bye.

222
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,812
Let me get this straight.

223
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,549
Jack sets off a nuke,
which means somehow resets everything.

224
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:45,719
So flight 815 never crashes.
it just...

225
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:48,755
Lands in l.a. safe and sound,
and none of this never happens.

226
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:50,724
Sawyer, if jack does this,

227
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,293
He could kill everyone
on the island.
yeah, i heard that part.

228
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,763
And you're okay with that?
you ain't hearing me, kate.

229
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,268
I made a choice,
and i'm sticking to it.

230
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:04,071
I decided to leave,
and i'm leavin'.

231
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:06,240
All right,
here's your sedatives.

232
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,043
(grunts)
(grunts)

233
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,612
What the hell
did you just do?

234
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,616
<i>we decided to leave
this island, james. we did.</i>

235
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,419
And now we're going back.
(unlocks handcuff)

236
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:22,789
You serious?
we can't just
let those people die.

237
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:26,426
You want out?

238
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:29,429
You wanna stay here
and whine about it?

239
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,702
Unlock the damn cuffs.

240
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,670
"galaga" to base.
the system check is complete.

241
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:40,407
We're locked on
departure bearing

242
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:42,409
And ready to leave the island.
(click)

243
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,378
(man) roger that, "galaga."
have a safe trip.

244
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:46,346
See you on the return.
(click)

245
00:17:46,414 --> 00:17:48,048
(cocks gun)

246
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:51,318
Give me your gun.

247
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:57,057
Appreciate that, captain. now we
need you to surface the sub.

248
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,428
What? i can't take this sub--
oh, i think you can.

249
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:04,331
Once we're gone, proceed
on course. whatever you do,

250
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:07,134
Do not take those people
back to the island. understand?

251
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:09,102
And what if horace
tries to contact me?

252
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,504
What am i supposed to say?

253
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:12,906
(crackle)

254
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,908
You ain't home.

255
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:19,212
Go.

256
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:24,117
(valves hissing, horn blows)

257
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:34,027
Sayid...

258
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,129
Is this big enough?
that'll do.

259
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:42,970
Are you done
with faraday's journal?
take it.

260
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,132
Can i ask you a question?

261
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,633
Sure.

262
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:16,336
Over, uh, 20 years ago,

263
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:18,372
A man named john locke...

264
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,175
He walked right into our camp,

265
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,178
And he told me that he was
gonna be our leader.

266
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:29,182
Now i've gone off the island
three times since then

267
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,451
To visit him.

268
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,821
But he never seemed, uh,
particularly special to me.

269
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,956
You said you had a question.

270
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:39,459
<i>you know him? locke?</i>

271
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:42,996
(chuckles)

272
00:19:43,064 --> 00:19:44,531
Yeah.

273
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,299
Yeah, i know him.

274
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:51,538
And if i were you,
i wouldn't give up on him.

275
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,345
(waves crashing)

276
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:09,022
Why haven't you
told him yet?

277
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,723
Told who what?

278
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,562
Richard. why haven't you told
him about my plans for jacob?

279
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:18,532
If by "plans" you mean
murdering him, john,

280
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,901
I assume you'd want
to keep that a secret.

281
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:25,572
(chuckles) when did that
ever stop you?

282
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:28,041
Well, i started thinking
differently about things

283
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,510
When my dead daughter
threatened to destroy me

284
00:20:30,578 --> 00:20:32,812
If i didt do
everything you said.

285
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,415
Whoa. w-w-wait. wait.

286
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,417
Where did this happen?

287
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:40,053
In that cavern
beneath the temple,

288
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:42,989
When we went
to see the monster.

289
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,725
So...

290
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:47,694
You're willing to do
whatever i say

291
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,729
No matter what it is?

292
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:53,666
Yes.

293
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,903
Well, then...

294
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:59,906
I guess i won't have to
convince you after all.

295
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,877
Convince me to do what?

296
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,116
I'm not gonna kill jacob,
ben.

297
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,452
<i>you are.</i>

298
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,113
Paris or rome?
no. (laughs)

299
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:31,582
Florence?
it doesn't matter, sayid...

300
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,852
Yes, it does.
as long as we're together.

301
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,188
It's our anniversary. we have
to find the perfect place.
i would settle for finng
my sunglasses.

302
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,361
Excuse me, sir?
could you you help me?

303
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,965
I'm sorry. i think i'm lost.
are you from los angeles?

304
00:21:47,032 --> 00:21:49,600
What are you looking for?
i found them. (grunts)

305
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:53,271
(tires screech)

306
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,741
(tires peal, engine revs)
nadia?

307
00:21:56,808 --> 00:22:00,578
(gasping)

308
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:03,848
(whispers) nadia?

309
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:07,485
(voice breaks) nadia?

310
00:22:07,552 --> 00:22:10,989
(speaking arabic)

311
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:21,966
(siren wailing)

312
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:24,969
(crying)

313
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:50,161
Time is short. let's go.

314
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,492
(solid knocks)

315
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,727
(hollow knock)

316
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,563
Mm, stand back.

317
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,672
(grunting)

318
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:42,746
(panting)
(sets down sledgehammer)

319
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,815
It's one of the dharma houses.

320
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,185
I'll go first.

321
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:49,988
Jack, don't misunderstand
who's in charge here.

322
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,522
<i>i'll go first.</i>

323
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,125
Becausif someone
at that house is a threat,

324
00:23:54,193 --> 00:23:56,660
You might hesitate...
but i won't.

325
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:59,163
All right. oy, eloise, go on.
after you.

326
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,199
Once we give you
the "alllear,"

327
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:04,835
<i>then you bring the bomb.</i>

328
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,571
We don't want any acci--oh!

329
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,707
What the hell are you ing?

330
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:12,176
(cocks gun)
i'm protecting our leader.
get back.

331
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:16,080
She's gonna be angry
when she wakes up,

332
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:18,516
But that's a lot better
than being dead.

333
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,485
She ordered me to help you.
we helped you.

334
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:22,453
Now you're on your own.

335
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:26,157
And i'm taking her out
the way we came in.

336
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:27,625
After you.

337
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:40,171
(siren wailing)

338
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:43,174
(indistinct shouting)

339
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:57,121
<i>(man over p.a.) all residents,
we are in a code black.</i>

340
00:24:57,189 --> 00:24:58,756
<i>report with your weapons</i>

341
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:00,891
<i>to your security assignments
immediately.</i>

342
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,527
(indistinct shting continues)

343
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:05,930
<i>if you come into contact
with a hostile,</i>

344
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:08,699
<i>you are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

345
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,969
How the hell are we gonna
get out of here?

346
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:14,738
(siren continues wailing)

347
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,141
(man) go! we don't have time!

348
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,110
We hide in plain sight.

349
00:25:19,178 --> 00:25:24,348
(siren continues wailing)

350
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,784
(phil speaking indistinctly)

351
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:29,454
Set up a perimeter
around the barracks first.

352
00:25:29,521 --> 00:25:32,557
You gonna go over there
by the gate. you get two...

353
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,860
(phil continues indistinctly)

354
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:39,997
So you guys go.
you go to pylons.

355
00:25:40,065 --> 00:25:42,633
(man) we're gathering
over there.

356
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,669
(siren continues wailing)

357
00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:51,675
(woman shouts indistinctly)

358
00:25:51,743 --> 00:25:53,244
(man shouts indistinctly)

359
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:56,013
Hey.

360
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:57,548
Hey!

361
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,954
You're the son of a bitch
who shot my kid.
don't fire that weapon!

362
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,857
(cocks pistol)
i'm carrying
a nuclear device.

363
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,727
(woman screams)
(man) it's the hostile!

364
00:26:14,733 --> 00:26:17,168
(indistinct shouting, gunfire)

365
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:22,740
(man) hey!
(man) let's go!

366
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,342
(gunshot ricochets)

367
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,945
(gunfire continues)

368
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:29,380
(click)

369
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:31,849
(gunfire continues)

370
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:36,420
(gunfire resumes)

371
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,268
Get in!

372
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:52,903
(sayid grunts)

373
00:26:52,971 --> 00:26:54,038
Drive!

374
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:55,839
(revs engine)

375
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,800
(sawyer) from the looks
of the sun,

376
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:16,136
I'd say that's
the north shore over there.

377
00:27:16,203 --> 00:27:19,973
(kate) sun's over there.
that's gotta be the west coast.

378
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,243
Really?
what, you got a compass?
no. do you?

379
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:37,958
(grunts)

380
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:41,461
(panting)

381
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:46,567
Thank you.

382
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:48,435
For what?

383
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:51,071
For backing me up
at the sub.

384
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,539
No problem.

385
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,143
I got no idea
where the hell we are.

386
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,112
(vincent barks)

387
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,415
Vincent! come here! hey!

388
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,917
Hey! hey!

389
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,552
How you doing, boy?

390
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,220
I haven't seen you

391
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:09,556
Since the flaming arrows
three years ago.
hi!

392
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:12,525
How you doing?
how did he survive alone
out here?

393
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:15,395
(rose) oh, hell, no.

394
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,533
Bernard!

395
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,009
(both laugh)

396
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:30,644
They found us.

397
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:36,016
Son of a bitch.

398
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:43,289
Is that a bomb?!

399
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:45,325
Try not to move.
i need to stop the bleeding.

400
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,595
What's going on back there?
is sayid okay?
does he look okay?!

401
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:51,898
Just keep your eyes
on the damn road!

402
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:54,901
Should i pull over?
yeah, let's pull over
and get shot! just drive!

403
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,470
I don't know
where we're going.
the swan site. head to the swan.

404
00:28:57,538 --> 00:29:00,340
Why do you want to go there?
if sayid's shot, shouldn't we--

405
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:04,410
Hurley, if you want to save
sayid, take us to the swan.
the swan it is.

406
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:08,414
(jin) jack, what's at the swan?
i think i found a way
to get you back to your wife.

407
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,887
So hold on.
you're telling me

408
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,356
You've just been living
out here in the jungle

409
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,159
For the past three years,
by yourselves?
uh-huh.

410
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:21,594
Well, i'm sorry y'all
got left behind.

411
00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:24,064
Didn't you hear me shout out,
"meet at the creek"?

412
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:26,566
You mean with flaming arrows
raining down around us,

413
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,369
Killing everyone we knew?
oh, sure, we heard ya.

414
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:31,571
Well, we spent all sorts of time
looking for ya.

415
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:34,808
I had jin out searching
the island grid by grid.

416
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,777
Ah, we know.

417
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,112
You know?

418
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,049
Oh, sure, you guys all joined up
with the dharma initiative.

419
00:29:42,116 --> 00:29:44,184
Well, damn, i could've
brought both y'all in.

420
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:47,888
Why didn't you find a way
to tell us you were out here?
because we're retired.

421
00:29:49,757 --> 00:29:54,161
(birds chirping)

422
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:56,163
So y'all been
scavenging food

423
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,099
And living out in a hut
by yourselves.
people try their whole lives

424
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,069
To get themselves a nice,
quiet place near the ocean

425
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:05,471
Where they can live in peace.
and we did it.

426
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,440
That's what we made
for ourselves.

427
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:10,476
Well, i hate to rain
on your parade, but...

428
00:30:10,544 --> 00:30:12,545
Your condo's
about to go ka-blooey.

429
00:30:12,613 --> 00:30:14,347
Jack has a bomb.

430
00:30:14,415 --> 00:30:15,448
Who cares?

431
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:17,117
Excuse me?

432
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:19,452
It's always something
with you people.

433
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,955
Now you say
jack's got a bomb.

434
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:25,358
And what, you guys are all
gonna try to stop him, right?

435
00:30:25,426 --> 00:30:26,827
Yeah, that's right.

436
00:30:26,894 --> 00:30:28,729
We traveled back
30 years in time,

437
00:30:28,796 --> 00:30:32,165
And you're still trying to find
ways to shoot each other?

438
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,501
Rose, we just need to know

439
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,971
Which way the dharma barracks
are from here

440
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,107
So we can stop jack,

441
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,109
Or you're gonna be dead.

442
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,676
We all will.

443
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,946
So we die.

444
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,048
We just care
about being together.

445
00:30:53,821 --> 00:30:56,223
That's all that matters
in the end.

446
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:05,665
The barracks
are 5 miles that way.

447
00:31:09,904 --> 00:31:11,604
Bernard.
sawyer.

448
00:31:11,672 --> 00:31:12,906
Rose.

449
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,641
Thank you.

450
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,477
(sawyer) let's go.
(juliet whispers) bye.

451
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,946
You sure don't want
some tea?

452
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,887
Maybe another time.

453
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,302
I wish you'd never showed me
what was in this damn box.

454
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,337
What the hell you gonna
do with it anyway?

455
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:46,339
We need to show it
to somebody.

456
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:47,874
What for?

457
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,976
So they'll know
what they're up against.

458
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:52,946
What exactly
are they up against?
something
a hell of a lot scarier

459
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,882
Than what's in this box,
frank.

460
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,320
Don't worry, though. as long
as you're with us, you're fine.

461
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:03,290
That's be reassuring if
i knew who you were, "friend."

462
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:05,959
We are the good guys.

463
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,795
In my experience, the people
who go out of their way

464
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:11,631
To tell you that the good guys
are the bad guys.

465
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:16,769
We're here.

466
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:32,919
Look at the ash!

467
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,525
Wait here.

468
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:43,629
(birds chirping and squawking)

469
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:51,704
(man speaking russian)

470
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,741
(wheels rattling)

471
00:33:02,683 --> 00:33:06,953
(speaking russian)

472
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,950
(speaking russian)

473
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,088
(speaking russian)

474
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:47,460
I'm here
because i need your help.

475
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,068
Can you do that?

476
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,907
Will you help me, ilana?

477
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,412
Yes.

478
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:14,254
(door creaks)

479
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:40,947
(sets down rifle)

480
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:00,000
What happened?

481
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:02,635
He isn't there,
hasn't been in a long time.

482
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,871
Someone else
has been using it.

483
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,742
Burn it!

484
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:15,848
I'm no tree hugger
or anything,

485
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,152
But that's a pretty good way
to torch the whole jungle,

486
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,254
Don't you think?
(glass shatters, whoosh)

487
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:23,123
So what now?

488
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,666
<i>well, i guess we know
where we're going.</i>

489
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,868
(fire crackling)

490
00:36:23,446 --> 00:36:25,380
(man) oh! oh, my god!

491
00:36:25,448 --> 00:36:28,383
(murmuring)

492
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:36,959
Oh, my god! call 9-1-1!

493
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,962
(woman) is he all right?
(woman) i don't know!

494
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,496
(man speaks indistinctly)

495
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:49,538
(gasps)

496
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:52,007
Don't worry. everything's
gonna be all right.

497
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:58,948
I'm sorry
this happened to you.

498
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:08,356
(surf rolling)

499
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,775
This is our old camp.

500
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:28,310
Home sweet home.

501
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,881
All right, everyone,
richard tells me

502
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,918
We should get to where
we're going by nightfall.

503
00:37:35,986 --> 00:37:37,886
So why don't you all
take this opportunity

504
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:39,855
To rest up
and catch your breath?

505
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,858
Considering what i have planned
for ya, you're gonna need it.

506
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:46,194
(indistinct conversations)

507
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,938
Everything all right?

508
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,841
<i>i was
enjoying some alone time.</i>

509
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:03,145
You see what's behind you?

510
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,318
It's a door. how about that?

511
00:38:10,386 --> 00:38:12,287
It's not just a door, ben.

512
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:15,490
It's the door to the hatch
where you and i first met.

513
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,461
You mind if
i ask you a question?

514
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,097
I'm a pisces.

515
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,933
What happened
that day at the cabin,

516
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,870
When you first took me
to meet jacob?

517
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,341
Well, you clearly
already know

518
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,844
That i was talking to
an empty chair, john...

519
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:40,315
That i was pretending.

520
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:43,786
Which is not to say that i
wasn't as surprised as you were

521
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:47,289
When things started flying
around in the room.

522
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:49,758
But why would you go
to all the trouble

523
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,994
To make something
like that up?

524
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:57,566
I was embarrassed.

525
00:38:57,633 --> 00:39:01,236
I didn't want you to know
that i had never seen jacob.

526
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,375
So, yes, i lied.

527
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:11,546
That's what i do.

528
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,822
All right, then.

529
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:23,558
<i>why do you want me
to kill jacob, john?</i>

530
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,563
Because...

531
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,399
Despite your loyal service
to this island,

532
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:33,268
You got cancer...

533
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:37,072
You had to watch
your own daughter gunned down

534
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,408
Right in front of you.

535
00:39:40,476 --> 00:39:42,477
And your reward
for those sacrifices?

536
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:44,046
You were banished.

537
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,315
And you did all this

538
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:50,518
In the name of a man
you'd never even met.

539
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:54,689
So the question is, ben,

540
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:58,127
<i>why the hell
wouldn't you wanna kill jacob?</i>

541
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:40,735
(cradle creaks)

542
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:30,512
(all chuckle)

543
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,122
How much further?

544
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,124
Uh, we're about five minutes
away.

545
00:43:16,192 --> 00:43:19,227
You can't stop the bleeding.

546
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:21,496
I need fresh dressings.

547
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:25,434
Jack, so this bomb is supposed
to what, blow us back in time?

548
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:26,601
We're not going back in time.

549
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:29,204
Right, because that
would be ridiculous.

550
00:43:29,272 --> 00:43:31,139
I need to modify the bomb.

551
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:34,076
I can rig it
so it detonates on impact.

552
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:37,679
Jack, we need to be there
at the moment of the incident.

553
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:40,148
(pants) or all of this
will be for nothing.

554
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:41,984
(gravel sprays)

555
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:43,986
Why the hell are we stopping?

556
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:45,420
<i>that's why.</i>

558
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,852
You'll see.

559
00:44:37,874 --> 00:44:39,842
Well, it's a wonderful foot,
richard,

560
00:44:39,909 --> 00:44:44,146
But what does it
have to do with jacob?
it's where he lives.

561
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,562
(slides open van doo

562
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:02,365
What's going on, kate?

563
00:45:02,432 --> 00:45:05,434
Doc, we gotta talk.

564
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:10,606
You wanna talk? then get in
the van. we don't have time--
i ain't gettin' in the van.

565
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:12,941
I need five minutes,
that's all.

566
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:14,943
I'll say what i gotta say,

567
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:18,013
And then you can do whatever
the hell you want to.

568
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:21,617
But you're gonna listen.
you owe me that much, jack.

569
00:45:25,054 --> 00:45:26,889
Five minutes.

570
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,834
(monitor beeping steadily)

571
00:45:52,115 --> 00:45:54,283
(monitor continues beeping
steadily)

572
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,484

573
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:57,620
(panting)

574
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,789
Dr. shephard?
you all right?

575
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:02,491
The dural sac--i cut it.

576
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,794
(monitor continues beeping
steadily)

577
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:07,330
Give me some suction.
(christian) calm down.
it's all right.

578
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,598
The fluid's leaking everywhere.
i can't--
look at me.

579
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,701
Give me some suction.
(woman) yes, doctor.

580
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,569
<i>jack... look at me.</i>

581
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,574
Count to five.
what are you talking about?

582
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,009
I'm talking about
you stitching up the sac

583
00:46:21,077 --> 00:46:23,979
So this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

584
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:28,250
And the only way you're gonna
do that is not to be afraid.

585
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,554
So close your eyes,
count to five,

586
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,156
And then fix her, jack.

587
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:39,495
Or i'll have to fix her
for you.

588
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,736
(monitor continues beeping
steadily)

589
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:50,038
One... (sighs)

590
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,307
Two...

591
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,009
Three...

592
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,246
Four...

593
00:46:57,313 --> 00:46:58,481
Five.

594
00:47:02,118 --> 00:47:03,586
Sutures.

595
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,425
(coin clinks)

596
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,894

<i>(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)</i>

602
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,942
Hey, kiddo.
girl's in recovery.

603
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,378
She's responsive
to stimulus below the waist,

604
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,247
So... no paralysis.

605
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:33,649
Good.

606
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,253
Something wrong, jack?

607
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:40,423
You embarrassed me.

608
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,958
Did i?

609
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,394
You know, it's bad enough

610
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:47,362
That everybody
in this hospital thinks

611
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,899
The only reason
i got this residency

612
00:47:49,966 --> 00:47:52,367
Is because you're my father.
but then you... (sighs)

613
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:55,270
You put me in a time-out
during my first major procedure,

614
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,907
In front of my entire team.

615
00:47:57,974 --> 00:48:02,010
(sighs) dad, i know
you don't believe in me,

616
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:04,212
But i need them to.

617
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,348
<i>are you sure i'm the one</i>

618
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:09,919
Who doesn't believe in you,
jack?

619
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:14,723
(coins clink, machine beeps)

620
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,428
One of these yours?

621
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,632
(sighs)

622
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,300
Machine got stuck.

623
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:28,571
I guess it just needed
a little push.

624
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,690
Take a load off, doc.

625
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,725
No, thanks.

626
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,394
Sit down, jack.

627
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:56,665
(birds chirping)

628

(exhales deeply)

629
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,872
My folks died
when i was 8 years old.

630
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,040
I ever tell you that?

631
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,710
No.

632
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,479
Con man took my dad
for everything he had.

633
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:14,182
He didn't handle it
too well, so...

634
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:19,187
He shot my mom,
then he blew his own head off.

635
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:21,657
I was hiding under the bed
when it happened.

636
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,759
I heard the whole thing.

637
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,630
I'm sorry.
yeah.

638
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,234
That was a year ago.

639
00:49:32,301 --> 00:49:34,202
What?

640
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,339
Right now it's july 1977,

641
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:40,509
Which means that happened
last year.

642
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,245
So i could've
hopped on the sub,

643
00:49:43,312 --> 00:49:45,614
Gone back to the states,

644
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,517
Walked right in my house

645
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,420
And stopped my daddy
from killing anybody.

646
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:53,556
Why didn't you?

647
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:57,459
Because, jack...

648
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,128
What's done is done.

649
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,368
It doesn't have to be
that way.

650
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,471
What did you screw up so bad
the first time around

651
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,506
You're willing to blow up
a damn nuke

652
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,976
Just for a second chance?
that's not what this is about.

653
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,311
<i>then what is it about?</i>

654
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:21,650
Three years ago,

655
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:25,353
Locke told me that all this
was happening for a reason,

656
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:28,156
That us being here
was our destiny.

657
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:30,793
I don't speak "destiny."

658
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,762
What i do understand
is a man does wh he does

659
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,498
'cause he wants something
for himself.

660
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:44,439
What do you want, jack?

661
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,316
I had her.

662
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,221
I had her, and i lost her.

663
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:03,225
Kate.

664
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,893
Well, damn, doc,

665
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,863
She's standing right on
the other side of those trees.

666
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,332
You want her back,
just go and ask her.

667
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:13,102
Nah, it's too late
for that.

668
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,075
Your five minutes is up.

669
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:23,045
Jack...

670
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,313
If what you're doin'
even works,

671
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,315
You and kate
will be strangers,

672
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:29,284
And she'll be
in damn handcuffs.

673
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,521
If it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

674
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:37,425
Well, i guess
there's nothing i can say

675
00:51:37,493 --> 00:51:40,629
That's gonna
change your mind.
no, i guess there's not.

676
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,164
(both grunt)

677
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:44,599
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

678
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:53,575
(both grunting)

679
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,610
(spits)

680
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,013
You think you can come here

681
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,448
And do whatever the hell
you want?

682
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:02,785
<i>i had a life here!</i>

683
00:52:04,353 --> 00:52:06,321
(both grunting)

684
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,925
(groans)
sawyer...

685
00:52:12,862 --> 00:52:14,063
(grunts)
(groans)

686
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:23,638
(both grunting)

687
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:26,341
Will you stop?
(groans)

688
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,811
Will you stop?!
no.

689
00:52:30,279 --> 00:52:33,515
Aah! (grunting)

690
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,218
(juliet) james!

691
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:38,721
Let him go.

692
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,489
He wouldn't listen.
i had to. he won't stop!
(cghs)

693
00:52:41,557 --> 00:52:44,126
That's because he's right.

694
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,961
What?!

695
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,562
He's right, james.

696
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,531
<i>we have to do this.</i>

697
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,800
What are you talking about?!

698
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,737
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

699
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,605
What happened?!

700
00:52:58,908 --> 00:53:01,509
I changed my mind.

701
00:53:11,081 --> 00:53:14,350
Girls...
your dad and i have something

702
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:16,752
We need to talk
to you both about.

703
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,854
Are we moving again?

704
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:21,290
No, stupid.
they're getting a divorce.

705
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:23,025
<i>rachel--
well, aren't you?</i>

706
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:26,862
Yes.
but...

707
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,864
We need you both
to understand

708
00:53:28,932 --> 00:53:31,300
That your father and i...

709
00:53:31,368 --> 00:53:33,269
We still love each other.

710
00:53:33,337 --> 00:53:35,804
Just because two people
love each other,

711
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:38,341
Doesn't always mean
they're supposed to be together.

712
00:53:38,408 --> 00:53:40,843
<i>but what if you are
supposed to be together?</i>

713
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,312
We're not, honey.

714
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,814
But how can you know
for sure?
we just know.

715
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,150
(cries)

716
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:50,052
And when you're a grown-up,

717
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,054
You'll understand.

718
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:55,691
I don't wanna understand!

719
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:57,560
Juliet, wait!

720
00:53:57,628 --> 00:53:59,462
I don't wanna understand!

721
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:02,431
Stop!
we gotta talk about this!
there's nothing
to talk about, james.

722
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:04,567
We have to let jack do
what he came here to do.

723
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:07,370
Well, maybe you shoulda told me
you had a change of heart

724
00:54:07,437 --> 00:54:11,340
Before i brought him out
in the jungle to kick his ass.
would that have stopped you?

725
00:54:11,408 --> 00:54:14,277
No.
well, then i'm glad you finally
got it out of your system.

726
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:16,779
Hey! hey!
you, don't.

727
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:20,149
I need you to tell me
where all this is coming from.

728
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:23,452
I mean, one minute, you're
leading the great sub escape,

729
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,889
And now you're on board
with blowing up the damn island?

730
00:54:26,956 --> 00:54:30,193
I got a right to know
why you changed your mind.

731
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:33,162
(panting)

732
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,098
I changed my mind
when i saw you look at her.

733
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:39,702
Don't. don't.

734
00:54:39,769 --> 00:54:41,370
(whispers) don't. don't.

735
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:43,939
I don't care
who i looked at.

736
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:45,675
I'm with you.

737
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:50,213
And you would stay with me
forever if i let you,

738
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,082
And that is why
i will always love you.

739
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:56,018
You don't--
what we had, it was just
for a little while.

740
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,986
And just because
we love each other,

741
00:54:58,054 --> 00:54:59,955
It doesn't mean
that we're meant to be together.

742
00:55:00,023 --> 00:55:02,791
<i>i mean, maybe we were never
supposed to be together.</i>

743
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:05,761
So if jack can make it that--
that none of you ever come here,

744
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:07,796
Then he should.

745
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:12,868
Why you doing this, juliet?

746
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:19,174
(voice breaks) i...

747
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:27,082
If i never meet you,
then i never have to lose you.

748
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:36,158
(drilling)

749
00:55:38,995 --> 00:55:40,796
(both speaking indistinctly)

750
00:55:40,864 --> 00:55:42,998
(chang) radzinsky!

751
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:44,667
What is it now?!

752
00:55:44,735 --> 00:55:47,770
The gauss readings
has jumped off the charts.

753
00:55:47,837 --> 00:55:50,339
Let me see.

754
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:53,376
This is it!
we're on top of the pocket!

755
00:55:53,443 --> 00:55:55,344
If we keep drilling
and hit that pocket,

756
00:55:55,412 --> 00:55:58,381
All hell
is gonna break loose!
(phil) radzinsky,
are you there? over.

757
00:55:58,448 --> 00:56:02,184
Stuart, come in!
what do you want, phil?

758
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:04,587
That hostile that shot the kid?
he came back.

759
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:07,256
What the hell
are you talking about?

760
00:56:07,324 --> 00:56:09,224
Here at the barracks.
he--he attacked us

761
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:11,193
And then got rescued
by some of the other recruits.

762
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:13,462
They stole a van and took off.
took off where?

763
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,164
I don't know,

764
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:17,166
But roger said
that one of them had a bomb.

765
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:20,603
Thatostile knows
about the swan!

766
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:22,571
Get some men and some guns,

767
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:24,940
And get your asses
out here right now!

768
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:28,210
If they're coming here,
we're gonna be ready for 'em.

769
00:56:28,278 --> 00:56:31,647
(radzinsky) come on!
keep it on the ground!

770
00:56:31,715 --> 00:56:35,451
Jack? what happened?

771
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,620
Uh... (sighs)

772
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:40,088
Yeah, my talk with sawyer
didn't go so good.

773
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:41,657
(chuckles)

774
00:56:41,725 --> 00:56:43,659
Does it hurt?

775
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:45,628
Ah, it's okay.
okay.

776
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:48,664
(drilling continues)

777
00:56:48,732 --> 00:56:52,401
(birds chirping)

778
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:56,372
Do you remember when i sewed
you up? when we first got here?

779
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,541
Yeah. (chuckle

780
00:56:58,608 --> 00:57:00,509
Seems like
a million years ago.

781
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:03,078
Or 30 years from now.

782
00:57:03,146 --> 00:57:06,482
(chuckles)

783
00:57:12,956 --> 00:57:16,792
Kate, why'd you make me promise
to never ask about aaron?

784
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:24,333
Because i was...

785
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:28,371
So angry with you
for making me come back here.

786
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:31,940
Is he why you came back?

787
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:35,711
I came back so he could be
where he belongs--

788
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,646
With his mother.

789
00:57:37,714 --> 00:57:39,948
If this works, claire will
never come to the land,

790
00:57:40,016 --> 00:57:41,950
And they'll always
be together,

791
00:57:42,018 --> 00:57:45,488
Just the way
they're meant to be.
she was gonna give him up
for adoption, jack.

792
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,490
Well, you don't know
what she would do.

793
00:57:47,557 --> 00:57:49,692
And whatever it is,
it would be her choice.

794
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,863
If you wanna save claire?
this is the only way to do it.

795
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:59,334
<i>nothing... nothing in my life
has ever felt so right.</i>

796
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:02,170
And... (sighs)

797
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:05,007
I just need you
to believe that.

798
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:12,681
(loud creaking, crash)

799
00:58:12,749 --> 00:58:13,716
Go!

800
00:58:13,784 --> 00:58:16,051
Keep going!

801
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,454
(alarm blaring)

802
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:21,457
Keep the drill going!

803
00:58:21,525 --> 00:58:23,826
It's about to happen.

804
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,566
Are you with me on this?

805
00:58:35,572 --> 00:58:37,807
Yes.

806
00:58:37,874 --> 00:58:39,107
Then let's go.

807
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:48,680
(man) copy that.

808
00:58:48,747 --> 00:58:51,482
One wallet.

809
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:56,554
$227 cash.

810
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:59,624
One ballpoint pen.
(clicks)

811
00:58:59,692 --> 00:59:01,559
One fruit roll-up.

812
00:59:01,627 --> 00:59:03,528
Sign here.
(lays down pen)

813
00:59:03,595 --> 00:59:05,997
You don't understand.
this is a big mistake.

814
00:59:06,065 --> 00:59:08,300
I killed a bunch of people.

815
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:10,635
You see this?

816
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:12,971
This is a discharge form.
you've been cleared.

817
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,374
So take your stuff and go.
look, dude...

818
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:19,777
There are men
with tranquilizer guns

819
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:21,746
Hunting me down
like an animal.

820
00:59:21,814 --> 00:59:24,382
They wanna bring me somewhere
against my will.

821
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,319
There's a cab stand
right out front.

822
00:59:34,126 --> 00:59:36,895
Oh. sorry. i didn't see
it was taken, dude.

823
00:59:36,963 --> 00:59:40,698
Actually, i'm only going
a few blocks if you wanna share.
cool. are you sure?

824
00:59:40,766 --> 00:59:43,168
Come on in.

825
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:50,608
You want some?

826
00:59:50,676 --> 00:59:52,110
Cherry.

827
00:59:52,178 --> 00:59:53,578
No thanks.

828
00:59:53,645 --> 00:59:55,213
(wrapper crinkles)

829
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,882
So what were you in for?

830
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:58,850
(rips wrapper)
excuse me?

831
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:00,085
Jail.

832
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:02,687
I was there
'cause i killed three people.

833
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:05,957
But i didn't really.
i guess they figured it out.

834
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:07,558
What about you?

835
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:10,762
I wasn't in jail.

836
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:14,432
Well, then what were you doing
sitting outside a prison?

837
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,301
In a cab?

838
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:19,504
I was waitin' for you,
hugo.

839
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:22,107
Oh.

840
01:00:22,174 --> 01:00:24,042
Then you must be dead.

841
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:25,710
I'm definitely not dead.

842
01:00:27,846 --> 01:00:30,248
Well, what do you want
from me?

843
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:33,718
I wanna know why you won't
go back to the island.

844
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:42,027
'cause i'm cursed.

845
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:44,095
Is that so?

846
01:00:44,163 --> 01:00:46,097
Uh-huh.

847
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:49,700
That's why the plane crashed,
my friends died--

848
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:51,869
Libby, charlie.

849
01:00:51,938 --> 01:00:54,005
Now they visit me,

850
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:55,974
And i can't make it stop.

851
01:00:56,042 --> 01:00:59,577
Well,
what if you weren't cursed?

852
01:00:59,645 --> 01:01:01,546
What if you were blessed?

853
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:04,215
How do you mean "blessed?"

854
01:01:04,283 --> 01:01:07,819
Well, you get to talk
to people you've lost...

855
01:01:07,886 --> 01:01:10,288
Seems like a pretty wonderful
thing to me.

856
01:01:10,356 --> 01:01:12,257
Oh, i'm sure it's wonderful,

857
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:14,792
<i>except for the part
where i'm crazy.</i>

858
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,828
(clicks tongue) i've got
some news for you, hugo,

859
01:01:16,895 --> 01:01:19,797
And you're just gonna have to
take my word on this.

860
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:22,900
<i>you are not crazy.</i>

861
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:28,639
<i>who are you, dude?</i>

862
01:01:28,707 --> 01:01:31,909
I'm just up here
on the corner.

863
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:36,014
Ajira airways flight 316
out of l.a.x.

864
01:01:36,082 --> 01:01:37,983
Leaves in 24 hours.

865
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,185
All you have to do
is get on that plane.

866
01:01:40,252 --> 01:01:42,520
<i>it's your choice, hugo.</i>

867
01:01:42,588 --> 01:01:45,890
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

868
01:01:50,629 --> 01:01:52,663
Wait!
you forgot your guitar.

869
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:55,666
It's not my guitar.

870
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,704
Don't worry, dude.

871
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:03,741
Everything'll be fine
when jack changes the future...

872
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:05,843
Or the past.

873
01:02:05,911 --> 01:02:07,512
One of those.

874
01:02:07,579 --> 01:02:10,748
I don't think your bud's
gonna make it.

875
01:02:10,816 --> 01:02:12,450
He'll make it.

876
01:02:14,153 --> 01:02:16,654
Dude, what happened
to your face?

877
01:02:16,722 --> 01:02:18,423
Nothin'.

878
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:20,892
We were just up on a ridge

879
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:23,928
Where we could look down
into the swan site.

880
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:25,930
(drops bag)
something just happened
down there.

881
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:29,600
(removes objects)
they hit something.
it's time for me to go.

882
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:31,536
It's all set to go.

883
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:33,905
Remember, be careful.

884
01:02:33,972 --> 01:02:35,873
It's rigged to explode
on impact.

885
01:02:35,941 --> 01:02:38,176
According to faraday's plan,

886
01:02:38,244 --> 01:02:40,645
You must get the bomb
as close as you can

887
01:02:40,712 --> 01:02:42,613
To the source
of electromagnetism.

888
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:44,715
(sighs

889
01:02:44,783 --> 01:02:47,218
Sayid, this is gonna work.

890
01:02:47,286 --> 01:02:49,120
And it'll save ya.

891
01:02:49,188 --> 01:02:52,557
Nothing can save me.

892
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:09,907
(exhales deeply)

893
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:26,558
?

894
01:03:35,634 --> 01:03:37,702
(sighs deeply)

895
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,542
See ya in los angeles.

896
01:03:58,124 --> 01:04:01,892
(surf rolling)

897
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:09,567
(indistinct conversations)

898
01:04:15,707 --> 01:04:18,909
Are you sure
you need to do this?

899
01:04:18,977 --> 01:04:22,079
If you waited, jacob would
eventually come to you, john.

900
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:25,683
I'm tired of waiting.
where is he, richard?

901
01:04:32,591 --> 01:04:35,693
What happened
to the rest of the statue?

902
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:40,231
I don't know. it was like that
when i got here.

903
01:04:40,299 --> 01:04:43,401
Do you expect me
to believe that?

904
01:04:45,404 --> 01:04:48,306
Not really.

905
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:49,940
All right, ben, let's go.

906
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,688
W-what are you doing?

907
01:05:05,324 --> 01:05:07,225
John wants me to join him.

908
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:09,527
You can't bring him in.
why not?

909
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:11,529
Because only our leader can
request an audience with jacob,

910
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:15,466
And there can only be one leader
on the island at a time, john.
i'm beginning to think

911
01:05:15,534 --> 01:05:18,436
You just make these rules up
as you go along, richard.

912
01:05:18,504 --> 01:05:21,406
N is coming in with me,
and if that's a problem,

913
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:23,908
I'm sure jacob and i
can work it out.

914
01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:50,235
(stone scraping)

915
01:05:55,574 --> 01:05:57,542
Tell him i said hello.

916
01:06:05,851 --> 01:06:08,819
(stone scraping)

917
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:33,444
Will you be able
to do this, ben?

918
01:06:35,247 --> 01:06:37,382
I know it won't be easy,

919
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:40,518
But things will change...
(whispers) once he's gone.

920
01:06:45,391 --> 01:06:47,258
I promise.

921
01:06:53,565 --> 01:06:55,566
(whoosh)

922
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,370
Can i ask you something,
lafleur?

923
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:21,907
There ain't no more lafleur,
enos. go ahead, shoot.

924
01:07:21,975 --> 01:07:24,877
Has it occurred to any of you
that your buddy's

925
01:07:24,945 --> 01:07:28,246
<i>actually gonna cause the thing
he says he's trying to prevent?</i>

926
01:07:30,283 --> 01:07:34,653
<i>perhaps that little nuke
is the incident?</i>

927
01:07:34,721 --> 01:07:37,122
So maybe the best thing to do...

928
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,257
Is nothing?

929
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:45,397
I'm glad you all
thought this through.

930
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:47,833
(vehicle approaching)

931
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,336
(juliet) what's going on?

932
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:52,805
It's phil.

933
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:55,373
That's the road to the swan.

934
01:07:55,441 --> 01:07:57,910
If they see jack,
they're gonna kill him.

935
01:07:57,978 --> 01:08:00,646
What do you think, blondie?

936
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:07,252
Live together, die alone.

937
01:08:10,156 --> 01:08:13,692
(alarm continues blaring,
man shouting indistinctly)

938
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:21,033
(man speaks indistinctly)

939
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:23,068
Good for you.
you got here fast.
any sign of 'em yet?

940
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:26,772
No, not yet. you got time
to set up a perimeter.
you called these men
to the site?

941
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,575
<i>you, rear ridgeline.
you, top ridgeline.
we need to be getting people
away from here!</i>

942
01:08:30,644 --> 01:08:33,211
You, top of the scaffolding.
go now!

943
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,782
(alarm continues blaring)

944
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,580
There!

945
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:12,184
(gunshots ricochet)

946
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:20,458
(man shouts indistinctly)
get him!

947
01:09:22,628 --> 01:09:25,297
Flank him! get him now!

948
01:09:25,364 --> 01:09:27,365
(vehicle approaches)

949
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:32,671
Who's this?!

950
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:36,441
(gunfire continues)

951
01:09:40,914 --> 01:09:41,947
Uhh!

952
01:09:46,419 --> 01:09:49,755
(gunshots ricocheting)

953
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:05,037
(gunshots ricocheting)

954
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:11,143
Aah!

955
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,612
Drop it, phil,
or you're a dead man!
okay, okay.

956
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,749
Tell 'em to put their guns down.
(phil) drop the guns!
drop the guns!

957
01:10:16,816 --> 01:10:19,517
(drilling continues)

958
01:10:19,585 --> 01:10:21,653
All right,
you can come out now, doc!

959
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:27,893
(cocks gun)

960
01:10:29,428 --> 01:10:32,064
Hurry up
and do your business.

961
01:10:32,132 --> 01:10:35,533
(alarm continues blaring)

962
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:38,170
Turn that damn thing off!

963
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,471
(clicking)

964
01:10:39,538 --> 01:10:43,075
(drilling continues)

965
01:10:43,143 --> 01:10:45,144
What's the matter?!
(clicking)

966
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:47,312
(hisses)
it won't shut down!

967
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,446
Why not?!

968
01:10:48,514 --> 01:10:50,448
Something's
pulling the drill down.

969
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:51,984
We hit the pocket!

970
01:11:02,228 --> 01:11:05,330
Hurry up, doc! what are you
waiting for?! drop it!

971
01:11:30,957 --> 01:11:34,726
?

972
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:46,872
(drilling continues)

973
01:11:50,443 --> 01:11:53,879
(panting)

974
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:01,686
(sighs) this don't look
like l.a.x.

975
01:12:03,022 --> 01:12:06,158
(metal clanking and banging
loudly)

976
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:10,162
(buzzing, magnetic humming)

977
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:12,697

978
01:12:14,367 --> 01:12:17,169

(metal creaking)

980
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:33,418
Aah!
dad!

981
01:12:33,486 --> 01:12:36,621
Aah!

982
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,692
(loud clank)
uhh!

983
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,094
Jack!

984
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:45,130
Dad!

985
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:52,137
(clatter)

986
01:12:52,205 --> 01:12:55,673
Get away from here! get as far
away from here as you can!

987
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:58,410
(radzinsky) get in!

988
01:12:58,477 --> 01:13:01,046
What the hell's going on?!
get out of here!

989
01:13:01,114 --> 01:13:02,381
Come on!

990
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,653
Go! go! go!

991
01:13:08,721 --> 01:13:11,756
(metal creaks)
(screaming)

992
01:13:15,194 --> 01:13:17,762
Hey, lafleur!

993
01:13:24,537 --> 01:13:25,570
(grunts)

994
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,874
Aah! help!

995
01:13:29,943 --> 01:13:32,610
Help!

996
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:37,382
Ah, come on!

(screaming)

1003
01:13:51,965 --> 01:13:54,933
Where do you think
you're going, blondie?

1004
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:57,169
(gasps)

1005
01:13:57,236 --> 01:14:01,473
Aah!
kate!

1006
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,208
(grunts)

1007
01:14:03,276 --> 01:14:04,943
(whimpers)

1008
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:07,145
Hold on! you hold on!

1009
01:14:07,213 --> 01:14:09,147
(crying) i can't.
i can't get it off.

1010
01:14:09,215 --> 01:14:12,584
I got you.
(grunts) i can't...

1011
01:14:12,651 --> 01:14:15,087
(metal creaking)

1012
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:16,855
Aah! juliet!
no!

1013
01:14:16,922 --> 01:14:18,790
(sobbing)

1014
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:21,726
I can't reach her.
you hold on!

1015
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:24,196
Aah!
no!

1016
01:14:24,263 --> 01:14:26,531
(cries)

1017
01:14:26,599 --> 01:14:29,267
I got you.
(creaking)

1018
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:31,136
(kate) sawyer!

1019
01:14:35,841 --> 01:14:37,809
Don't you leave me.

1020
01:14:37,877 --> 01:14:39,711
(panting) it's okay.

1021
01:14:39,778 --> 01:14:42,080
<i>don't you leave me!</i>

1022
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:44,483
(sobbing) i love you.
no, you don't let go!

1023
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,451
I love you, james.
don't let go.

1024
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:48,786
I love you so much.
no!

1025
01:14:48,854 --> 01:14:51,023
No, n't let go!
aah!

1026
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,290
Juliet!

1027
01:14:52,358 --> 01:14:54,459
<i>no!</i>

1028
01:15:00,766 --> 01:15:03,402
(sobbing)

1029
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:17,479
Water?

1030
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,581
Do you have any alcohol?

1031
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,418
(chuckles)
no. sure wish i did.

1032
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,160
(guns cock)

1033
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:34,563
Don't shoot.

1034
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,298
It's okay.

1035
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:39,634
It's all right.

1036
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,776
Which one of you
is ricardus?

1037
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,722
It's richard, actually.

1038
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,725
What lies in the shadow
of the statue?

1039
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:11,966
<i>ille qui nos omnes servabit.</i>

1040
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,539
Richard...

1041
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:20,575
I'm ilana.

1042
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:23,111
I have something
you need to see.

1043
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,447
Open it up.
(guns cocking)

1044
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,216
It--it's okay. it's okay.
let them.

1045
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,015
Where did you find him?

1046
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:05,820
In the cargo hold
of the plane we came here on...

1047
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,189
In a coffin.

1048
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:15,196
I don't understand.

1049
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:18,199
If this is locke...

1050
01:17:18,267 --> 01:17:19,901
<i>who's in there?</i>

1051
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,662
You like it?

1052
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:25,834
I did it myself.

1053
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:32,374
It takes a very long time
when you're making the thread,

1054
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,808
But, uh...

1055
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:37,178
I suppose that's the point,
isn't it?

1056
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,348
Hello, jacob.

1057
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:46,454
Well,
you found your loophole.

1058
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:49,657
Indeed i did.

1059
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,599
<i>and you have no idea</i>

1060
01:18:57,666 --> 01:19:00,268
What i've gone through

1061
01:19:00,335 --> 01:19:02,203
To be here.

1062
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:07,776
Have you met before?

1063
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,011
In a manner of speaking.

1064
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:17,786
(whispers) do what
i asked you to, ben.

1065
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,459
Benjamin...

1066
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,127
Whatever he's told you,

1067
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:29,163
I want you to understand
one thing.

1068
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,735
You have a choice.

1069
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:39,641
What "choice"?

1070
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,644
You can do what he asked,

1071
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:45,447
Or you can go,

1072
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,282
Leave us to discuss our...

1073
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:51,453
Issues.

1074
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:59,994
Oh... so now,
after all this time,

1075
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:03,030
You've decided
to stop ignoring me.

1076
01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:09,370
35 years i lived
on this island,

1077
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:12,507
And all i ever heard
was your name

1078
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,943
Over and over.

1079
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,311
Richard would bring me
your instructions--

1080
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,447
All those slips of paper,

1081
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:23,184
All those lists--

1082
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:26,287
And i never questioned
anything.

1083
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:29,657
I did as i was told.

1084
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:36,297
But when i dared
to ask to see you myself,

1085
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:40,267
I was told,
"you have to wait.

1086
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,804
You have to be patient."

1087
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,810
<i>but when he asked
to see you?</i>

1088
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:54,582
He gets marched straight up here
as if was moses.

1089
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:02,056
So... why him?

1090
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:06,093
Hmm?

1091
01:21:09,131 --> 01:21:12,567
What was it that was
so wrong with me?

1092
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,441
What about me?!

1093
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:26,548
<i>what about you?</i>

1094
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:34,923
(whispers) oh.

1095
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:36,758
(normal voice) well...

1096
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:39,493
(grunts)

1097
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:41,095
(pants)

1098
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:48,536
Agging) they're coming.

1099
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,538
What?

1100
01:21:50,606 --> 01:21:52,674
(gagging)

1101
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,308
I can't hear you.

1102
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,243
They're coming.

1103
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:19,667
(sawyer) juliet!
(buzzing and humming continues)

1104
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:24,072
(kate)
sawyer, get off of there!
(metal continues creaking)

1105
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,440
We have to go right now.
we need to go!
(groans)

1106
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,176
Get off.

1107
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:33,247
It's going down! this thing is
gonna go! you have to let it go.

1108
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,850
You have to go. this thing is
going to blow at any second.
no!

1109
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:37,919
Jack!
jack, help me get him off.

1110
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:41,188
(buzzing and humming continues)

1111
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,600
(loud crashing)

1112
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:06,213
(gasps)

1113
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:09,316
(coughing)

1114
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,552
(wheezes)

1115
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,320
(whimpers)

1116
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:16,357
(breathing rapidly)

1117
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:23,131
