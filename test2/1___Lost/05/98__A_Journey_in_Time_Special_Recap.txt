1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,600
Somewhere...

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,700
the pilot said we're over
a thousand miles off course.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,100
On a mysterious island...

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
this place is different.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,500
48 passengers... 

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,300
if we can't live together...

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,200
survived the crash
of oceanic 815.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,000
We're gonna die alone.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,600
108 days pass... 

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,900
i'm one of the survivors
of flight 815.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,900
And six people find rescue.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,300
So we can go
off the island?

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,100
But their friends...

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,300
sawyer!

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,600
Are left behind...

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,600
- wait!
- we need to go back!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And the island... is suddenly...

18
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,000
gone...

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,600
wait! Don't move!

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Anyone?!

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Taking the few who remain...

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
run!

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
On a journey...
what the hell is going on?

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,200
Through time.

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,800
We're either in the past

26
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,500
or we're in the future.

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,800
Now...

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,500
flash forward.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
We made a mistake.

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
Three years have passed.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Somebody knows we're lying.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,600
The people i left
behind need our help.

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,000
And those who made it home...

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,200
it wants us to come back.

35
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,700
What is this place?

36
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,300
Find a way back...

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,900
ajira airways flight 3-1-6.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,100
To save their friends...

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,800
you have a bit of
a journey ahead of you. 

40
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,200
To change their fate...

41
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,000
now i know why i'm here.

42
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,400
To fulfill...

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,000
you might wanna
fasten your seat belt.

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
Their destiny.

45
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,500
There's no turning back now.

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,700
Lost 

47
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,400
Lost A Journey In Time Recap Special
B i e r d o p j e . c o m

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
We're coming in for a landing.

49
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,200
Now there's a lot of press
that wanna speak to you.

50
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,800
They're referring to you
as the "oceanic six."

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,600
The journey of the survivors
of oceanic 815

52
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,400
Has taken
two very different paths,

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,300
And tonight we explore
where both have led.

54
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,000
If we were to sum up season five in sort
of one simple concept, It's "going back."

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,000
The first part of the season
was about the oceanic six.

56
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,000
If we get any questions
that we don't wanna answer,

57
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,700
Let's just keep our mouths shut.

58
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,100
They'll think that we're in shock. 

59
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,100
We are in shock, jack.

60
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
When the season started, we had our
characters In two different places.

61
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,200
We had this group of six characters
Who had returned to the real world 

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,800
and then A bunch of characters
who got left behind on the island. 

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,600
The island itself had disappeared When
benjamin linus, the leader of the others,

64
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,000
Turned an ancient wheel
to move the island

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,800
And keep it hidden from
his nemesis, charles widmore.

66
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,500
And so to protect the friends
they left behind,

67
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
The oceanic six agreed to lie
about their entire experience. 

68
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
We were in the water for over a day
Before the current took us in.

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
By then, there was
only eight of us left.

70
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,100
Ms. Austen, what was it like
giving birth on the island? 

71
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Scary.

72
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Mr. Jarrah, is it possible
there are any other survivors

73
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
From the crash yet
to be discovered? 

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,000
Absolutely not.

75
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,100
We come realize that there's
an entire chapter After that for jack 

76
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,000
and for all the other
characters. They come back,

77
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,500
and they discover There's nothing
left for them in the real world.

78
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,000
There's this sort of gnawing sensation
That there is a greater destiny to be had.

79
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Hello? Who's there? 

80
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,100
The island needs you.
You have to go back.

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,300
Kate is raising
claire's son aaron as her own.

82
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
She knows that claire, who's
aaron's mother, is now gone.

83
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,900
And the only way that she can
protect aaron To to say he is hers. 

84
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,600
And we later realize... 

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Emotionally, kate is still reeling from sawyer's
decision To jump off of the helicopter.

86
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,300
Sawyer!

87
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,900
This man that she really loved
left her, abandoned her,

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
Decided to stay behind
on the island. 

89
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
What a coward.

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,500
He was trying to do the right thing.

91
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,900
He was trying to get away from you.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,200
She's trying to heal the emotional scar left
By sawyer taking himself out of the equation.

93
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
He made his choice.
He chose to stay. 

94
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,100
And ever since that moment, Jack has
wondered, what did he say to her? 

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
Why won't you tell me?

96
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Because he wouldn't want me to. 

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,700
And the fact that he still has this
jealousy, What does this mean for them? 

98
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
You have problems.
You need to figure them out,

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,400
'Cause i can't have you
like this around my son.

100
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,200
You're not even
related to him!

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Excuse me, mr. Widmore?

102
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm sun kwon. 

103
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Sun leaves the island,
and she's devastated

104
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,400
Because she's just seen
her husband die.

105
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,400
wait!

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,100
Jin!

107
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,500
And there's one other catch.

108
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,100
Sun was pregnant
when she left the island,

109
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,600
So they now have a daughter,
ji yeon, who jin has never met.

110
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
i miss you so much

111
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,900
She wants to bring to justice

112
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,100
The person who she blames
for jin's death,

113
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,100
And she goes
to charles widmore.

114
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,100
You mentioned that you and i
had... common interests.

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Why don't you tell me
exactly what they might be?

116
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,100
To kill benjamin linus.

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Ben left the island when he turned
the wheel Below the orchid station...

118
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,200
and was transported to the tunisian
desert, Ten months in the future. 

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,900
I just want to bury
my wife in peace.

120
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,800
Mr. Jarrah? There's a woman
outside. She said she knows you,

121
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,900
But she wasn't on the list
of family members.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,900
Nadia?

123
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,300
Sayid is incredibly happy Because he's
reunited with nadia, the love of his life.

124
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
And things seem
to be going great

125
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,200
Until nadia's
struck by a car.

126
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,100
Ben claims charles widmore was
responsible for nadia's death.

127
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Why would these
people want to murder her? 

128
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,100
I don't know.

129
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,700
His heart is black now
Because his wife has been killed.

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
He very happily goes to work for
benjamin linus And starts killing people. 

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
Is this your first time
in the seychelles?

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,600
He believes that he is Assassinating
associates of charles widmore,

133
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,500
Who, in the opinion of benjamin
linus, Is sort of the big bad guy.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,700
I just killed a man who's been perched
outside this facility For the last week. 

135
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
I want you to come with me. 

136
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,600
We're not going back, are we?

137
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,000
No, just somewhere safe.

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
I don't think
we should lie, dude.

139
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,100
I mean, the island disappeared-- Bloop!

140
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,000
You think anyone's
gonna believe that?

141
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,800
They're gonna think you're crazy.

142
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,100
Hurley really resists
telling this lie.

143
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,300
Of all our characters, he's sort
of the most morally grounded.

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,900
Surprise

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Interesting choice of theme. 

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Yeah. Mom...
really doesn't get it, dude.

147
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,800
For a while, hurley seems to be
living a fairly good existence.

148
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,200
He gives away all his money.

149
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,500
He occasionally sort of crashes
at his parents' house.

150
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,400
But then he starts to become
haunted by visions of charlie.

151
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Help! Help!

152
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
What the hell
is wrong with you?

153
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,500
He gets himself thrown
into a psychiatric hospital.

154
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,600
- I saw charlie.
- Take your meds, hurley.

155
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,400
Charlie said someone's gonna
be visiting you, too... 

156
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,100
soon.

157
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,300
Jack shephard was the character Who
wanted the most to get off the island.

158
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,300
Good-Bye, john.
The rest of us are going home. 

159
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
You're not supposed to go home.

160
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,700
Then what am isupposedto do?! 

161
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
You know that
you're here for a reason.

162
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,500
And if you leave, that knowledge
is gonna eat you alive.

163
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,800
Once he got back to the real world, however, He
discovered that things were not what he expected. 

164
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,000
I miss you.

165
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,100
He finally gets to bury his father,
even though He doesn't have the body. 

166
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,700
He resumed his practice. 

167
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,600
Jack?
He had these problems in that
he was seeing His dead father around,

168
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,900
and that was very disturbing. He
starts popping pills and drinking.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,800
The great and glorious life that he was expecting
To return to off the island didn't really exist.

170
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,700
But he's very steadfast in his
decision to leave the island.

171
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
- I don't think we did the
right thing, jack.
- Hurley...

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,100
it's gonna do everything it can-- 

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
We're never going back!

174
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,200
He's not a guy
who changes his mind often,

175
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,100
But then something
very significant happened,

176
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,500
And that's that john locke
is off the island.

177
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,600
Locke returned to civilization Three
years after the oceanic six came home.

178
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,100
What are you doing here?

179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
We have to go back.

180
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Of course we do.

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,100
Jack, the people
i left behind need our help. 

182
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
Because it's our destiny.

183
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
How many times are you gonna
say that to me, john?

184
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,500
Jack says, "i'm not gonna
pay attention to you."

185
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,100
And locke says...
you're father says hello.

186
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,200
- What?
- The man who told me
how to bring you all back?

187
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,000
He said to tell his son hello.

188
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
He said his name was christian.

189
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,100
My father is dead.

190
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
We didn't look dead to me.

191
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,400
I put him in the coffin!

192
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,300
He's dead.

193
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
This really emotionally
devastates jack,

194
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,500
And this changes
his entire attitude,

195
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,900
So he starts flying again,
hoping that he'll crash.

196
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,400
Then he learns
that locke has died.

197
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Jack again realized That going back
to the real world was a mistake...

198
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
we... were not
supposed to leave. 

199
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,800
Yes, we were.

200
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,300
That this thing that he had
wanted, Not only for himself 

201
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,900
but for all of other characters,

202
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,000
Maybe that wasn't the
best thing for him. 

203
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,300
And it's locke's death That
catalyzes jack to return to the island.

204
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,100
Hello, jack.

205
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,300
Didn't mean to scare you.

206
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,300
Did he tell you that
i was off the island? 

207
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,200
He told me That after
i left the island,

208
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
some very bad things happened.

209
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,600
And he told me that it was
my fault for leaving.

210
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,000
And he said that i had
to come back.

211
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,100
All of you have to go back.

212
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
We're gonna
have to bring him, too.

213
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,300
The day the oceanic six
left the island,

214
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
John locke was appointed
the leader of the others. 

215
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Hello, john. Welcome home.

216
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But his new position
did not last long.

217
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,200
Richard? Richard?!

218
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,500
There's a lot of mystery surrounding the idea
Of exactly what is skipping through time.

219
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,900
Is it the island?
Is it the people on the island?

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
When the sky lit up,
where did you go?

221
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I didn't go anywhere, john.
You went.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Here's what we know-- There is
a donkey wheel In a very, very cold place 

223
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,300
down below the orchid station.

224
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,000
We know that when you turn it,
the island moves.

225
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
When the island disappeared it
was basically set off its axis,

226
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,100
And it started skipping through time. 

227
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,300
Next time we see each other,
i'm not gonna recognize you.

228
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,300
You give me this.
It's a compass.

229
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,700
The only way to save the island, john,
Is to get your people back here.

230
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,300
How am i supposed to do that?

231
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,600
You're gonna have to die, john.

232
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
Time travel had existed
on the show earlier.

233
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,900
We saw desmond's consciousness
travel In the episode "the constant." 

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
Hey, hey. You okay?

235
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,300
We've had sayid listening to
a transmission from the 1940s.

236
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,900
It could be coming from
anywhere. Or anytime.

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
But in this season, time travel
becomes much more over it.

238
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Whatever ben linus did
down at the orchid station

239
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Dislodged us.

240
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,600
Dislodged us from what?

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,500
Time.

242
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
Our characters have these encounters With
things that took place in the island's past.

243
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,900
And none is any more significant
Than sawyer wandering through the jungle,

244
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,800
Seeing kate helping
claire give birth. 

245
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,100
Come on, claire! Push!

246
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,500
And this is An incredibly powerful,
emotional moment for him.

247
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,800
And we realize that is also the night That 
locke first saw this light shing out of the hatch.

248
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,000
That light in the sky-- It was
from the hatch, wasn't it?

249
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,500
The night that boone died,
i was confused, scared.

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,800
The light came on
and shot up into the sky.

251
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,500
At the time, i thought it meant
something. It was just a light.

252
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,400
All these things
are happening for a reason.

253
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,400
So to tamper with them,
it's kinda like cheating.

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,500
I need that pain

255
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,200
to get to where i am now.

256
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,000
And this is Just a very
lockeian, philosophical way

257
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800
Of saying the same thing
that faraday's saying.

258
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,400
You can not change anything.
You can't.

259
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,700
If we try to do anything
different, we will fail.

260
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,100
Whatever happened, happened.

261
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
We discover that jin Basically survived
the explosion of the freighter

262
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,200
And he washed up on the shore And
was rescued by these french people.

263
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,600
You danielle rousseau?

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,900
Yes. That's right.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,100
This is a young rousseau
who's pregnant with alex,

266
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,900
And we discover the things
that ended up driving her mad.

267
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,300
You!

268
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
- Jin?
- Sawyer?

269
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,300
Well, what do you say?

270
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,900
Where is sun?

271
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Our characters also find themselves
getting attacked By these flaming arrows.

272
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,500
Run!

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,500
And it turns out That the people who
are massacring them are the others.

274
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
But it's not the others That have been
terrorizing us in the present of the island.

275
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,400
This is the 1954 version of the others.

276
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
What are you doing on our island?!

277
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,300
And what's cool about this Is we
meet charles widmore as a teenager. 

278
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,300
Your name is widmore?

279
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
- Charles widmore?
- What's it to you?

280
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,900
We also meet this young
blonde woman named ellie.

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,100
Who are you and what are you
doing on our island?

282
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,900
Daniel faraday asked her
to bring him out to this bomb

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
That's called jughead--
It's a hydrogen bomb--

284
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
And he tells her it's very
dangerous, It's leaking radiation. 

285
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,900
You need to take it off this
platform carefully and bury it.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
Is that why
they moved to 1954?

287
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,800
It feels like everywhere they move to,
None of those moves were arbitrary.

288
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,800
Every one of them had significance. 

289
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,200
I expect you to tell me
how to get off the island.

290
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,600
That's very privileged
information. 

291
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,700
Oh, no.

292
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,600
They land someplace,
and a few minutes later,

293
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,800
There's a bright flash of light.
There's this incredible noise.

294
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,600
They disappear, And they find
themselves in another point in time.

295
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,500
And it's causing enormous
problems for our characters,

296
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,300
Our brains have an internal
clock, a sense of time.

297
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
The flashes throw the clock off.

298
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,600
If you fly to a different time zone,
You're sort of off your axis.

299
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,300
But when you do it traveling
through time, it's much worse.

300
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,900
In fact, it can be fatal. 

301
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
We have to go back to the orchid.

302
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,400
Ben used it to leave the island,
and if i can do the same thing,

303
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
I believe i can save us.

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Aah!

305
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Aah!

306
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,100
Hello, john. I'm here to help
you the rest of the way.

307
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,800
It's locke's genius idea
to go turn the wheel again.

308
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,700
If that's what got them
into this problem,

309
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
Maybe that's the way
it'll get them out. 

310
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,400
Say hello to my son.

311
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,900
Sure enough, that works. It puts
the island back on its axis. 

312
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400
I think it's over.

313
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,000
I think john did it.

314
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,100
But the survivors were left
stranded on the island in 1974,

315
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,600
And spent the next three years
with the dharma initiative.

316
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,900
But locke went on
a far different journey

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,100
When he was transported to the tunisian
desert Three years in the future to 2007. 

318
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,400
John, my name is charles widmore.

319
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,900
I met you when i was 17.

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
How long has it been for you
since we first met?

321
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,800
- Four days.
- That's incredible.

322
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Widmore wanted to
get back to the island,

323
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
So he helped locke
find his friends.

324
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,000
The folder contains
your people's whereabouts--

325
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,800
Everyone that was on
the island that left. 

326
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,200
Mira. Tienes un visitante.

327
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,500
John locke came not only
to see jack, But he saw sayid,

328
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,400
he saw kate.
And john locke says, 

329
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
"you never should've left the island.
You've gotta help your friends."

330
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm not going back.

331
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
The answer is no. 

332
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
No, i'm not going
anywhere with you!

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,500
You leave me alone, and you
leave the rest of them alone!

334
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,600
Locke believed he had failed
and saw only one option.

335
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,100
John?
But in locke's despair,

336
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,500
ben saw opportunity.

337
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,800
John, stop!

338
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,000
W-What are you doing here?

339
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,700
Locke is the man that ben
left in charge of the island.

340
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,400
I couldn't get a single one
of them to come back with me.

341
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,100
Ben is now thinking, maybe this is
an opportunity For me to go back 

342
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,500
and get my old position. 

343
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,300
Jack booked a ticket. 

344
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,800
- What?
- From los angeles
to sydney, tonight.

345
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,400
And if you've got jack,
you can get the rest of them. 

346
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,400
There's only one way i can do that,
And that's if i kill john locke.

347
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,900
You haven't even been to sun yet. 

348
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,300
I promised jin that
i wouldn't bring her back.

349
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
Jin... is alive? 

350
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,800
But locke has a very important piece
of information That ben doesn't have. 

351
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
There's a woman
here in los angeles--

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,300
Eloise hawking.

353
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,900
That name means
something to ben.

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,600
And she knows a way
to get back to the island,

355
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,800
So all he has to do
is kill locke.

356
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,000
So ben kills john locke, and then he starts
These manipulations of everybody else.

357
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,500
I'll miss you, john.
I really will.

358
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Ben went to eloise hawking,

359
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,800
Hoping she would know
a way back to the island.

360
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,100
- Any luck?
- Yes.

361
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,000
Benjamin linus is not the type
of guy who wants to be vanished.

362
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,700
His one goal in life Is to be
the ruler and leader of the island. 

363
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,500
You only have 70 hours.

364
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,600
So what happens if i can't
get them all to come back? 

365
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,400
Then god help us all.

366
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,000
The only way that benjamin linus
can get back on the island

367
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,500
Is if he gets the oceanic six
to want to go back.

368
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,400
Ben had a difficult task,
but jack was already convinced.

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,100
Find yourself a suitcase.

370
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,100
If there's anything in this life
you want, pack it in there,

371
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Because you're never coming back. 

372
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,600
Good.

373
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello, hugo.

374
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Aah! 

375
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,500
Ben started trying
to manipulate them

376
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Into wanting
to go back to the island.

377
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,300
If you come with me, you won't
ever have to lie again.

378
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,300
Let me help you.

379
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,100
Never, dude.

380
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,600
He hires a lawyer
to start harassing kate.

381
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,600
We're here to get
a blood sample from you

382
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
And one from your son aaron.

383
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Why?

384
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,200
To determine your
relationship to the child. 

385
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,000
This is ben trying to put enough guilt in
kate's mind To get her to go back to the island...

386
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,900
why don't you leave me
and my son alone?

387
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Because he's not your son, kate. 

388
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,100
And it's something that
kind of freaks her out.

389
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
We were in the supermarket,
And i turned around for one second,

390
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,600
and he was gone.
Aaron? Aaron?!

391
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,200
All i could think was,
it's about time.

392
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,400
Why would i expect
him to be taken? 

393
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,400
Kate doesn't realize That she's replacing
the wound left by sawyer with aaron.

394
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,200
Because you took him, kate.

395
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,600
Ironically, it's pointed out to her
By an ex-Girlfriend of sawyer's.

396
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,300
Sawyer broke your heart.

397
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
How else were you
supposed to fix it?

398
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,200
So kate has a change of heart.

399
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,000
She returns aaron
to his grandmother.

400
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,300
I told him that you'll
take care of him while i'm gone 

401
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
And that i'll be back soon.

402
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,100
Where are you going?

403
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,100
I'm going back
to find your daughter.

404
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,300
Sun had no intention of going
back to the island. 

405
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Move away!

406
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,900
Instead, she was determined
to avenge jin's death.

407
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,500
But before she's able
to kill ben,

408
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,100
Ben stops her and he says,
"your husband isn't dead,"

409
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,500
And he gives sun a wedding ring--
Jin's wedding ring. 

410
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,100
All those people back on the
island, jin included, Need our help. 

411
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
And it's proof that
jin's still alive, 

412
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,700
and that is how Ben is able
to convince sun to return to the island.

413
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,600
I thought i said all of them. 

414
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,400
This is all i could
get on short notice.

415
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,700
We discover that there is
a dharma station off the island.

416
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,300
The dharma initiative
called it the lamp post.

417
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,900
This is how
they found the island.

418
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,500
And we meet this character
eloise hawking down there,

419
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,100
And she can use
the resources of the station

420
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
To determine where exactly
the island is located

421
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
At any given point in time.

422
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,800
There's a commercial airline
flying from L.A. To Guam

423
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,000
That's going to go
right through our window.

424
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,400
Ajira airways flight 3-1-6.

425
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
The show can be strange
or weird or magical,

426
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,700
But in this case, the dharma initiative Used
good old-Fashioned math to find the island.

427
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
So stay in school, kids.

428
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,400
We just get on that flight
and we just hope that it works?

429
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,900
No, that's not all, jack.

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,700
Eloise hawking says, "it's not
just about being on this plane.

431
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,400
You have to try to recreate the emotional conditions
Surrounding you at the time that oceanic 815 crashed. 

432
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,200
John locke is going to be a substitute,

433
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Which is why you need to give
john something of your father's.

434
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
Wherever you are, john,

435
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
You must be
laughing your ass off.

436
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,000
'Cause this is
even crazier than you are.

437
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,700
For jack, he was transporting his father's dead
body From sydney to Los Angeles in a coffin.

438
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,600
Now that's gonna be
john locke.

439
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
And your relation
to the deceased?

440
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,500
He was a-a friend.

441
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,900
This whole idea of, "Wow, history
seems to be repeating itself here." 

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,900
I thought maybe you
might change your mind.

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If there's even a chance
that jin is alive,

444
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,900
I have to be on that plane. 

445
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,900
Kate was in handcuffs.
She was a prisoner.

446
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,400
This time around,
it's sayid who is the prisoner.

447
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,300
Sayid has no desire
to go back to this island.

448
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,100
And he's drinking himself a very
expensive glass of scotch,

449
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,100
And he meets this very fetching and
beautiful woman Who's sitting at the bar.

450
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,000
Things look sort of romantically
promising for sayid, And then 

451
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
boom-- He gets
kicked in the face.

452
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,800
It works
for some people...

453
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
- just not-- Not for sayid.
- Not for sayid.

454
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,700
- I was hired to bring you to guam.
- Who hired you?

455
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,700
The family of peter avellino,

456
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,000
The man you killed last year on
a golf course in the seychelles. 

457
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Can i ask you a favor?

458
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
Can we get the next plane?

459
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,600
This is the plane
we're taking.

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Hurley, what are you doing here?

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,400
The last time we saw hurley,
He was in prison... 

462
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,400
i'm totally cool.
I'm in L.A. County lockup.

463
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,300
Incarcerated for double murder. It turns
these were people who sayid killed.

464
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,600
But benjamin linus' lawyer
apparently got him off.

465
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,600
All that matters is
that i'm here, right?

466
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,300
So there are a lot emotional
circumstances Surrounding the ajira flight,

467
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,800
Echoing back to
the original pilot of the show,

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,400
Even though it's three years later And they've
been through these amazing adventures together.

469
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
You made it.

470
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Yeah. I made it.

471
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,400
Wait! What's he doing here?!
He can't come!

472
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,100
No one told me
he was gonna be here.

473
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Who told you to be here, hugo?

474
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,400
Are you working
for benjamin linus?

475
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
Who's benjamin linus?

476
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,100
He's the monster responsible
for nothing short of genocide.

477
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,500
Why would i work
for somebody like that?

478
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,400
I did.

479
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Our guys get on flight 316.

480
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,700
They kind of have this sense That
they're gonna get back to the island.

481
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,200
You don't think it means something
That somehow we're all back together?

482
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,800
We're on the same plane, jack.
Doesn't make us together.

483
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,400
What they don't expect is that they hear
an announcement Over the intercom. 

484
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,600
This is your captain,
Frank J. Lapidus.

485
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,800
Welcome aboard. 

486
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,200
Frank lapidus was the helicopter
pilot that came on the freighter

487
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,000
And was ferrying the, uh, science
team To and from the island.

488
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,600
Well, hello, doc.

489
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
What are you doing here, frank?

490
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,600
Ah, i fly this route
all the time.

491
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,100
Sometimes i take the big birds
into new... delhi.

492
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Is that sayid?

493
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,700
And hurley.

494
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Wait a second. We're not
going to guam, are we?

495
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Lapidus is flying along and he has
a strong sense Of foreboding.

496
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,700
You all right there, frank?

497
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
I'm just fine. 

498
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,500
And sure enough,
they're struck with turbulence.

499
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,200
Dude, you might wanna
fasten your seat belt.

500
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,100
Aah!

501
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,400
They find themselves flashing
from night to day... 

502
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,500
Mayday! Mayday!

503
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,500
And it's all frank lapidus can
do to safely land this airplane.

504
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,100
They land on the island, And
four of them have disappeared.

505
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,900
There's no jack,
there's no kate, 

506
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
there's hurley
And there's no sayid.

507
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Where'd they go?

508
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,700
They're gone.

509
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,000
Gone where?

510
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,000
How would i know?

511
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,300
So the plane lands on the island
In the island present,

512
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,000
but these four characters...

513
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
appear on the island
30 years earlier.

514
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,800
Help! Help!

515
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,500
Kate.

516
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,700
What happened?

517
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,600
Eloise hawking has said That you have to
replicate The circumstances of 815 exactly.

518
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,300
They were not able to do that. 

519
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Where's the plane?

520
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,500
Which is what triggers
some of them to move to 1977.

521
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,800
Jin?

522
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,000
When john locke stopped
the flashes on the island...

523
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,800
my nose isn't bleeding anymore.

524
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
He saved the lives of his friends.

525
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,100
Now we wait for him to come back.

526
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
For how long?

527
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,300
As long as it takes,

528
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,400
Unfortunately, it strands
all of our characters in 1974.

529
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,900
The only people that are on this compound
Are members of the dharma initiative.

530
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The sub returns in two weeks.

531
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,300
Until then, you can stay.

532
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Horace says we can wait
for the next sub.

533
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,000
With any luck,
locke'll be back by then.

534
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,200
And then what?

535
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
When the oceanic six left
the island on the helicopter,

536
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,300
Sawyer was assuming
that they might return 

537
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
because locke said, "I'm gonna go
get those guys and bring 'em back." 

538
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm going to leave.

539
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Just give me two weeks.
That's all i'm asking.

540
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,600
All right, two weeks.

541
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,900
Somehow, two weeks
turned into three years.

542
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Hey, welcome to the island, man.

543
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,800
Who wouldn't love
living in the '70s?

544
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,600
The dharma initiative
sort of have it all.

545
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,200
They're living
on this beautiful island.

546
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,400
They go to barbecues.
They get to wear cool jumpsuits.

547
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,200
They listen to cool music.

548
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,400
And over the course of that time,
Sawyer finds himself in a leadership role.

549
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,800
Mr. Lafleur here can
fill you in on the situation.

550
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,000
- "Mr. Lafleur"?
- It's creole. Improvised.

551
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,500
And he's really good at it. 

552
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,400
Mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you.

553
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,800
Here's a guy who was always sort of
an outsider And a bad boy and a rebel.

554
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,100
He is actually now The head of
security of the dharma initiative.

555
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,300
He's well-Respected. 

556
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Good man-- Lafleur.
Runs a very tight operation.

558
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,200
most notably jin and miles. They happen
to have been assigned to security as well.

559
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,900
Evening, enos.

560
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,400
People like him. He doesn't
ruffle any feathers.

561
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,000
They have a truce
with the others, so 

562
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,400
the biggest issue That he's
dealing with is public drunkenness.

563
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,100
More significantly, sawyer's begun
A romantic relationship with juliet.

564
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,000
And they are cohabitating
and they have a wonderful life.

565
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
What does that mean,
living together?

566
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,600
- That means they're living together. Yeah. So...
- Oh, okay. Then they are cohabitating.

567
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,500
at least until
our characters return.

568
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,000
What?

569
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,300
What? No.
Don't bring 'em in.

570
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Who was it? 

571
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,300
Sawyer and
juliet get along great.

572
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
There's none of the sort of, uh, emotional
fireworks That existed between he and kate. 

573
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Everything okay?

574
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,700
I gotta go.

575
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,900
But now kate's back, and as
soon as they see each other,

576
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,800
That chemistry just locks in
for both of them.

577
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,200
Dude, i can't believe!

578
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,300
Easy on the ribs there, kong.

579
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,600
- And that throws a big wrench in
the mechanism, doesn't it?
- Huge.

580
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,100
So what's up with you guys
in the old dharma jumpsuits?

581
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,600
We're in the dharma initiative.

582
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,200
It's 1977.

583
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,600
Uh... what?

584
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,300
All right, listen, y'all are gonna be The second
batch of recruits coming in off the sub.

585
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,100
Sawyer kept the arrival
of his friends quiet

586
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,700
And brought them into the
dharma initiative As new recruits. 

587
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,900
I never actually thought
they'd come back.

588
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
So they're back?
Nothing's changed.

589
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,700
Juliet gives a warning
that their life is over,

590
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
And sawyer really doesn't think
that's gonna be the case.

591
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,400
And although sawyer says,
"juliet, i'm in love with you,"

592
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Juliet also acknowledges That this
is the beginning of the end for them. 

593
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,300
Everybody say "namaste."

594
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,700
Namaste!

595
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,700
Sun comes back to the island
for one reason only,

596
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,500
And that is
to find her husband jin.

597
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
She goes back
to dharmaville.

598
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,100
Now it's all dusty
and overgrown. 

599
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,500
I don't think We're gonna
find your husband here. 

600
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,100
She happens to find none
other than christian shephard.

601
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,600
Where is my husband?

602
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,200
He's with your friends.

603
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm sorry, but you have a bit
of a journey ahead of you.

604
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,600
She doesn't know how she's going
to reunite with her husband,

605
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,000
Who is also on the island, But is on
the island in a different period of time.

606
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey, you understand
the concept of knocking? 

607
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Jin doesn't know where sun is.

608
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,100
He doesn't know where the plane is.

609
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Can you check with the other stations?

610
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,700
I just told you.
I would not--

611
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,500
Check with
the other stations.

612
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,000
So he's very invested in any way
that he can get back to sun.

613
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
Where did you get this?
Who gave this to you?

614
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,800
He said his name
was christian.

615
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,100
He said if i ever wanted
to see my husband again,

616
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,000
I had to wait here for john locke. 

617
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,600
But considering he's dead,
we ain't holding our breath.

618
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,400
Well, you might want
to look outside.

619
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,600
John locke is very much
alive again,

620
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,100
And that's sort of one
of the big revelations,

621
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,300
Particularly for ben,
who actually killed john locke.

622
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
My god. 

623
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
And ben is incredibly surprised. Like, 

624
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,500
what does it mean that he is alive?

625
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
Because it's one thing
to believeit, john.

626
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
It's another thing to see it.

627
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,900
And that is a question The
audience has rightfully been asking--

628
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,200
What does it mean
that john locke is alive?

629
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,200
Locke was dead. He rembers
being killed by ben.

630
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,600
I remember dying. 

631
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,400
And that's it.
Now he's back on the island.

632
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,100
The island's
given him life again.

633
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,500
The first time
he came to the island,

634
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,400
He was in a wheelchair,
and then he could walk.

635
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,300
This is now that
times a thousand.

636
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,100
So he really feels like he has this
incredible sense Of purpose and destiny. 

637
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,700
Well, ben, i was hoping that you and
i could Talk about the elephant in the room. 

638
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,600
I assume you're referring
to the fact that i killed you.

639
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,600
Yeah. 

640
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,300
Because it was in the
best interests of the island.

641
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,600
I was just hoping
for an apology.

642
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,400
So having come through
this experience,

643
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,300
There is a tremendous amount
of faith and confidence.

644
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,300
What he's up to,
we don't know.

645
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,500
Locke is a mystery again, like
he was when we first met him.

646
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,200
How is it that you know
where you're going?

647
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,400
And that's kind of a very
exciting place for him to be.

648
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,500
I just know.

649
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,700
John locke seems to have A far superior
sense of communication with the island,

650
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,400
And this really makes benjamin
linus very upset.

651
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,300
I've seen this island
do miraculous things,

652
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,000
But never once has it done
anything like this.

653
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,300
So the fact that john locke
is walking around this island

654
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,400
Scares the living hell
out of me.

655
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,000
For hurley, the '70s were a chance
To make thworld a better place.

656
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,300
I made lunch for the crew.

657
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,600
You're waiting for the next van. 

658
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,500
Why don't we carpool?

659
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,300
It'll help with global warming,
which hasn't happened yet.

660
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,900
So maybe we can prevent it. 

661
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,900
Hurley is really going with the
flow here in dharma times.

662
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,700
When he first arrives, he's very
confused about time travel...

663
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,600
okay, answer me this. 

664
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,900
Which we think makes him a lot like
The people who are watching the show.

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,200
If all this
already happened to me,

666
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Why don't i remember
any of it?

667
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,200
Because our experiences
in the past and the future

668
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,400
Occurred before
these experiences right now.

669
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
Say that again. 

670
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,100
But once he sort of gets
into the groove of things,

671
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
He becomes a dharma chef.
He starts cooking.

672
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,500
Don't forget to try
the dipping sauces.

673
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,200
They really bring out the ham.

674
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,900
And he's working on a side project,

675
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,100
Which is that he's writing
"the empire strikes back."

676
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
George lucas is gonna
be looking for a sequel,

677
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,700
So i figured, make life easier
and send him the script...

678
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,100
with a couple improvements. 

679
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,600
And there's this big mystery
hovering over hurley, Which is, 

680
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,400
why did he come
back to the island?

681
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,900
How did he know
about ajira flight 316?

682
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,500
What's up with that guitar case? 

683
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,900
What is his mission really? 

684
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,400
4. 8, 15...

685
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,000
16, 23. 

686
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,000
The fact that the numbers brought him
here, That he may have been cursed. 

687
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,700
Oh, hold on a minute.
It's smudged.

688
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,800
42.

689
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,900
42.

690
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,300
How the hell did you know that?

691
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,800
They're building our hatch.

692
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,500
And hurley becomes friends
with miles,

693
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,100
And he discovers that miles
Is actually the son of pierre chang,

694
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,700
Who is the star of these
dharma orientation films.

695
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,300
Third day we were here,
i was on line at the cafeteria,

696
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,500
And my mother got in line
behind me.

697
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,000
That was my first clue. 

698
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,300
And hurley sort of takes it upon himself
To get these two characters back together. 

699
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,200
We should all get together
for a beer sometime.

700
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
How awesome would that be?

701
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,500
As hurley made new friends... 

702
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,300
we got a hostile inside the perimeter.

703
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,200
Another ajira passenger
had a far different experience.

704
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,100
Unlike the other characters
who jumped back into 1977,

705
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Sayid is separated, and he is not able to
get indoctrinated Into the dharma initiative.

706
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,600
- Sayid
- Jin.

707
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,900
Shut up!

708
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,900
He's out in the jungle And is
captured by the dharma initiative.

709
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,900
I'm sorry, sayid.

710
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,200
He meets this young kid
who comes to bring him food...

711
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,500
i'm ben.

712
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,900
None other
than benjamin linus.

713
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
How you doing?

714
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,500
A 12-Year-Old ben linus brought
me a chicken salad sandwich.

715
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,900
How do you think i'm doing?

716
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,300
Sweet kid, huh?

717
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,200
There are two fundamental ways
to look at time travel--

718
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,400
You can change the future,
or you can't change the future.

719
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
And sayid, all of a sudden, A lightbulb
goes off in his head and he says,

720
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,100
"I know now why i came
back to this island." 

721
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,700
I think i can help you.

722
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,900
He thinks that, if i kill benjamin linus,
just like if Someone were to kill young hitler, 

723
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,700
that person won't Grow up to be
the bad guy that they grew up to be,

724
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,100
And that he can change things.

725
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,700
I really hate it here.

726
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,200
He wins young ben's confidence.
He gets young ben to help him escape.

727
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,200
Sayid repays him
by shooting ben.

728
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,000
Which leads one to believe That this
is where ben's trust issues were born.

729
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,600
Doc, i need you
to come with me.

730
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,000
The kid's losing blood. We need you
to show us where he sprung a leak. 

731
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,300
No.

732
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,700
If you don't come with me,
jack, that kid's gonna die. 

733
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,500
Then he dies.

734
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,300
Jack seems very willing to sort of
let fate and destiny Guide him, in a way, 

735
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,800
and not be willful anymore. 

736
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,700
He's just a boy, jack.
You can't just let him die.

737
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,300
When we were here before, I spent
all of my time trying to fix things.

738
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,000
But did you ever think That maybe the
island just wants to fix things itself?

739
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,100
Jack has become
this man of faith,

740
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
And he has this sort of
zen-Like quality.

741
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,900
I liked the old you. 

742
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,400
You didn't like the old me, kate.

743
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,600
We can't just sit here
and do nothing.

744
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,300
Maybe there's something
they can do.

745
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,900
The others.

746
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
And lo and behold,
kate saves ben.

747
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,100
If i take him, he's not ever
gonna be the same again.

748
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
He will always be one of us.

749
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,900
You still want me to take him?

750
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,300
Yes.

751
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,000
So ben ends up living
and becoming ben.

752
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,900
Ben, i'd appreciate it
if you joined us. 

753
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,400
What, john, don't you trust me
here with my former people?

754
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,900
Afraid i'll stage a coup? 

755
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, ben.

756
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Now that locke's
back on the island,

757
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,600
He's got an agenda to go
and find alpert and the others.

758
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,200
I brought dinner.

759
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,100
John?

760
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,200
Who's that man
he's talking to?

761
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,600
He's a kind of advisor.
His name is richard alpert.

762
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,900
Richard alpert is
a very interesting character.

763
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,600
It's-- It's clear that he's been
on this island for a long time,

764
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,000
And he doesn't age. 

765
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,600
You do remember birthdays,
don't you, richard?

766
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,900
And one of the most important
things about alpert right now

767
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,900
Is he's the only character
on the show who's in both times.

768
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
He's in 1977.

769
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,200
He's also in 2007.

770
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,500
I am the leader now.

771
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes, john, that's right.

772
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,800
Good, then i would like you
to take me to jacob

773
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,700
We all answer to someone, john.

774
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,600
And whom might that be?

775
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,100
His name is jacob.

776
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,500
There is this larger spiritual presence That
the people on the island refer to as jacob.

777
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,400
Aah!

778
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,300
- Jacob wanted it done.
- Jacob talks tome, john.

779
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,600
We've seen apparitions
that may or may not be jacob.

780
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,800
That was jacob. 

781
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
If everybody met jacob,
we haven't been told that.

782
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,800
Are you jacob?

783
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,900
I'm christian.

784
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,200
When we met christian shephard,
for example, in the cabin,

785
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,400
He says, "i'm speaking
on behalf of jacob."

786
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,800
No one else has ever
seen him. 

787
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,200
- That's right.
- How convenient.

788
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,000
For some time, you all have been
accepting orders From a man named jacob.

789
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,100
And john locke says, "i'm very curious
about a lot of things"On this island 

790
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,900
and why jacob is asking us "To do
the things that we've been doing.

791
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,700
"And once we have
that conversation,

792
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
I think i'll be able to lead
you a lot more effectively." 

793
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,500
So i'm gonna go and see jacob,

794
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,100
And i'd like all of you
to come with me.

795
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm starting to think
john locke is gonna be trouble.

796
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,600
Why do you think
i tried to kill him?

797
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm here to follow you now,

798
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
So if you need jacob to
help you reunite your people,

799
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,600
Then i'll do whatever-- 

800
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
I'm not interested in
reuniting with my people.

801
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,100
Then why are we going
to jacob?

802
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,000
So i can kill him.

803
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,500
hey, can i get a hand with this? 

804
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,300
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

805
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,300
After a 3-Year absence, Daniel faraday
returned to the island in 1977.

806
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,700
- Dan.
- Hey, miles.

807
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,800
Long time, no see.

808
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Daniel faraday is
an expert in physics.

809
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,300
Particularly in the field
of quantum physics,

810
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
And he knows
about time travel.

811
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,800
And he leaves the island and he
goes to ann arbor, michigan,

812
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,200
Joins the dharma initiative,

813
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
And he goes over all
of his life's work. 

814
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,800
Right on time.

815
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,800
Faraday is convinced that he actually
now has A significant mission to perform.

816
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,800
The orchid station
was under construction

817
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,600
And becoming a dangerous
endeavor For the dharma initiative.

818
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
The same thing is gonna happen
at the site For the swan station,

819
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,800
and the accident...

820
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,700
is gonna be catastrophic. 

821
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,600
What could possibly qualify you
to make that kind of prediction?

822
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm from the future.

823
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,400
For most of the season,
daniel faraday basically said,

824
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,900
"If you try to change the past,
it's not gonna work out,"

825
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,200
Except now faraday appears
to have changed his mind.

826
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,200
I finally realized...

827
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,700
people.

828
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,800
We think, we reason,
we have free will.

829
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,400
We can change our destiny.

830
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,600
And he's determined that,
yes, you can change the future

831
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,800
If you do something
really significant.

832
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,700
And he says, "the way that i can do that Is
to prevent the hatch from ever having been built."

833
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,900
The dharma folks
at the swan work site-- They're gonna-- 

834
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,300
They're gonna
drill into the ground

835
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,300
And accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

836
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,500
In order to contain it, they're gonna have to
Cement the entire area in like chernobyl.

837
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,200
They're going to spend the next 20 years Keeping that energy at bay 

838
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,800
by pressing a button--

839
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,800
A button that your friend desmond...
<i>system failure.</i>

840
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,000
Will one day fail to push,

841
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,600
and that will cause your plane
To crash on this island.

842
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,500
All this is about faraday pushing
the reset button In a huge way.

843
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,000
I think we can change that.

844
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,900
And that hatch
will never be built,

845
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,800
And your plane will land
just like it's supposed to.

846
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,200
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

847
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,100
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

848
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
Hey, james.

849
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,900
Welcome to the meeting, twitchy.

850
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,200
So he walked into sawyer's house And
he addresses everybody and he says,

851
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,200
"I have a way to get us
all back to where we belong."

852
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,200
Does anyone know where
i can find the hostiles?

853
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,900
Why do you need to know that, daniel?

854
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Because one of them is my mother.

855
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,500
Your mother is an other?

856
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,200
You met her back in 1954.
They were calling her ellie.

857
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,800
This character eloise hawking--
She is daniel faraday's mother.

858
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,100
Where is eloise?

859
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,600
But now in 1977, Faraday's mother
is now 20 years older

860
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,100
And encounters faraday again.

861
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,300
She's not here right now. 

862
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,500
The hydrogen bomb i told your
people to bury-- Where is it?

863
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,300
Just put the gun down.

864
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,000
Faraday has the misfortune of dying.

865
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Right, yes. He gets shot by his mom.

866
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Who are you?

867
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,200
I'm your son.

868
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,100
We have to go, jack.
We have to go right now.

869
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Jack and kate are
captured by the others...

870
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,200
and eloise hawking has, like,
a new motivation herself, right?

871
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,300
Because she's hoping that you
can change the future 

872
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,200
because She would certainly
very much like, Not to have her son die. 

873
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
♪ How is this my handwriting ♪
♪ if i don't rember writing it? ♪

874
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,600
Because you haven't
written it yet.

875
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,200
And jack finally realizes,
"this is why i'm in 1977."

876
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,700
What you just did,
it was an accident,

877
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,100
And i think that there's a way
for you to take it all back.

878
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,300
"My destiny is to prevent myself From ever
having come to this island in the first place."

879
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Your son came back here

880
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,300
Because he had figured out
a way to change things.

881
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,700
He doesn't have to be dead.
You don't have to have killed him.

882
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Does he know what
he's talking about?

883
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
He thinks he does.

884
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,800
All right, then...

885
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,800
i'll take you to the bomb.

886
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,700
You two know how to swim? 

887
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,000
Why don't we just go around it?

888
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
We have to swim under the pond
to get to the tunnel.

889
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,900
I'm not going.

890
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,300
I can't go any further with you,
jack, not this time. 

891
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,500
Kate...

892
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,600
jack makes her very uneasy
and uncomfortable Because 

893
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,700
he's really undergone An incredible
transformation as a character.

894
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,900
And if you're wrong,
Then everyone on the island dies.

895
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,000
Do you understand that? 

896
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,900
I'm not wrong, kate. This is it.

897
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,300
This is our destiny. 

898
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,200
Do you know who you sound like?

899
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,500
Because he was crazy, too,
jack. You said so yourself.

900
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm going back to find
the rest of our people,

901
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,600
Because if i can't stop you,
then maybe they can.

902
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,000
Kate made her way back
to the compound,

903
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,800
Where sawyer and juliet
were planning an escape.

904
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,500
You called it the minute
those yahoos got there.

905
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,000
I should've listened to you.

906
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,300
Fairly quickly,
everything unravels.

907
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
One of sawyer's trusty security guys

908
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,200
Finds this videotape with evidence..
That sawyer is not who he says he is, 

909
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,500
and, of course, All the dharma
people are shocked Because 

910
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,400
sawyer was the very beloved
head of security. 

911
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,700
That's not good, right?

912
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,100
That woman-- 

913
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,000
Where is she now?

914
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,800
They beat the crap out of him
trying to find out what he knows

915
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
And-- And where young ben is.

916
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,400
But they got sawyer and juliet.

917
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
There are 30 of them
and they all have guns. 

918
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
We gotta do something.

919
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,200
I mean, sawyer would never
leave us behind.

920
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Dr. Chang.

921
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,500
Your friend faraday said
that you were from the future.

922
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,300
Dude, that's ridiculous.

923
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
What year were you born?

924
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,900
Uh... 1931.

925
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
You're 46?

926
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,200
Who's the president
of the united states?

927
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,100
All right, dude,
we're from the future. Sorry.

928
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,000
Your friend, the physicist--

929
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,000
He said there was going to be
a massive accident at the swan.

930
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,600
Now is that true?

931
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
He's been right
about everything so far.

932
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,300
We need to evacuate the island of all
nonessential personnel, And you need to do it...

933
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
what the hell is going on here?

934
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,200
Aren't you supposed to be
at the swan right now, chang?

935
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
We're supposed to break ground
in less than 20 hours.

936
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,600
If we start drilling, there's a high
probability Of a cataclysmic accident. 

937
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,200
We are drilling and on schedule!

938
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,800
He's right. It ain't safe.

939
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,200
Put the women and children on the sub
And get 'em the hell out of here.

940
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,800
Sawyer makes a deal
with them and says,

941
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,800
"I will give you
the information you want

942
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,500
As long as you put me
on the submarine."

943
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,200
He's content, at this point,

944
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,100
To just sail off to
the real world with hell juliet.

945
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,100
Once we dock, wherever
we dock, we're free.

946
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
I love you.

947
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,100
Well, i love you back.

948
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,000
Hold on!
Don't close the hatch!

949
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,600
But then, unfortunately...

950
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,700
kate gets tossed in the mix.

951
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,200
Oh, kate.

952
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

953
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Apparently, she's come back to try
to warn them About what jack's up to,

954
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,600
But she's now captured
by the dharma initiative.

955
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,100
So now you've got those three
characters Sailing away from the island,

956
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,300
And jack back on the island,
on his way to a hydrogen bomb.

957
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,700
There are crazy things
happening on this island.

958
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,900
There is a sense
of destiny and purpose.

959
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,400
But all of that is secondary to the fact
that These people are here for a reason.

960
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,800
These characters are
intertwined in ways That 

961
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,400
they don't even fully
realize and understand yet.

962
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,500
The relationships they
form, the friendships--

963
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,100
Who's gonna live?
Who's gonna die?

964
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,800
Those are the really exciting
stories that we wanna tell,

965
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,800
Starting in this finale and rolling
into The final season of the show.

966
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,300
We've been excited for a long time
About where the show is going

967
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,800
and now we finally get to share The
rest of that journey with the audience.

968
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,700
We think the best part of the story Is
still yet to be told in this final season,

969
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,300
And we hope people
will enjoy the ride with us.

970
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,700
Well... 

971
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,400
now what

972
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
1000fr
