******Back here.

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,570
The chopper was headed
for the boat.The boat--

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,380
no, they're fine, john,
and they're already home.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,040
So you have convince them to come ck.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,350
How? How am i supposed to do that?

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,840
You're gonna have to die, john.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,610
You're going down there?

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,540
What exactly are you hoping to find?

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,580
A way off the island.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,220
once you get all of
your friends together--

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,840
and it must be all of
them, everyone who left--

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,970
once you've persuaded them to join you,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,290
eloise hawking will tell
you exactly how to come back.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,870
Richard said I was going to die.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,190
That's why they call it sacrifice.

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
caesar.

18
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,470
ilana. What's up?

19
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,270
Find anything?

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,800
No. Nothing useful.

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,420
Then what'd you just put in your bag?

22
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,270
If you want it, it's yours.

23
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,810
We found
someone--a man.

24
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,130
What?

25
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,320
Roxanne was scting just south of here,
and he was just standing in the water.

26
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,940
He's wearing a suit.

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,280
- Nobody recognizes him?
- No. Whoever he is, he didn't come with us.

28
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,470
Then how do we know he isn't
one of the ones who disappeared?

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,460
He's not.

30
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,260
And how do you know?

31
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,520
Because he wasn't on the plane.

32
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,950
What did this man have to say?

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,120
You can ask him yourself.

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,340
Hello.

35
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,270
hello.

36
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,610
My name is caesar. What's yours?

37
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,100

Hello.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,370
Breakfast? We found a
tree. They're pretty good.

44
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,360
Much obliged.

45
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,620
- I'm ilana.
- John.

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,410
Are those your boats?

47
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,200
No. They were already here.

48
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,340
There used to be three, but the
pilot and some woman took one.

49
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,860
Didn't tell anyone, just ran
off in the middle of the night.

50
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,870
The pilot of the plane
that brought you here?

51
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,470
Yes. That's right.

52
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,880
Do you have a passenger list?

53
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,500
you'll have to talk to caesar.

54
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,850
I think this is the best
mango I've ever eaten.

55
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,310
Body remembersyou being on the plane.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,480
Well, I don't remember
being on it either.

57
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,940
- What do you remember?
- I remeer a lot.

58
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,920
Like why you're dressed up so nice?

59
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,820
No, but I can guess.

60
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,690
Please. Guess.

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,620
I think this suit is what
they were gonna bury me in.

62
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,810
- Sorry?
- You asked what I remembered.

63
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,660
I remember dying.

64
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,850
good luck, john.

65
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,020
say hello to my son.

66
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,310
Who's your son?

67
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,940
<i>T**</i>

68
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,430
is anybody in there? Can you help me?

69
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,540
God!

70
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,990
where is this? where am I?
Where am I? Where is this?

71
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,810
sir, where am I? Who are you?

72
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,740
Where am I? Do you speak english?

73
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:50,960
you swallow. swallow.

74
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,140
where are we?

75
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,170
oh--what? What?
What?What--

76
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,400
you bite. Bite!

77
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,440
john?

78
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,760
John, wake up.

79
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,280
You had a compound fracture.

80
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:11,370
The doctors here did their best, but I had a
specialist flown in to reset your leg properly.

81
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,950
it's nice to see you again, john.

82
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,340
- Do I know you?
- yes.

83
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
I understand your being confused.

84
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,010
Imagine how I feel.

85
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,110
I met you when I was 17.

86
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,930
And now all these years
later, here we are.

87
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,860
You look exactly the same.

88
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,210
who are you?

89
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,770
my name is charles widmore.

90
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,400
Tell me, john. How long
has it been for you since...

91
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:03,420
we first met, since you walked into
our camp and you spoke to richard?

92
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,600
Four days.

93
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,440
that's incredible.

94
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,850
- The camera in the desert--
that was yours? - Yeah.

95
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,480
How did you know I'd be there?

96
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,890
Because that's the exit.

97
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,780
I was afraid benjamin might fool you into
leaving the island, like he did with me.

98
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,410
I was their leader.

99
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,680
The others?

100
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,100
They're not the "others"
to me. They're my people.

101
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,220
We protected the island peacefully
for more than three decades.

102
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,000
But then I was exiled by him...

103
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,890
just as you were.

104
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,710
No. Ben wasn't even there when
I left. He was already gone.

105
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,370
I-I... I wasn't exiled.
I... chose to leave.

106
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,540
Why... would you do that, john?

107
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,100
You've come to bring them
back... the ones who left.

108
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,900
no.

109
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,960
I understand you lying to me. I do.

110
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,060
But there's something you should know.

111
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,230
All your friends who left the island?

112
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,150
They've been back three years.

113
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,440
Three years?

114
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,910
And they've gone back
to their normal lives.

115
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,080
and none of them has spoken a word
of truth about where they were.

116
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,040
I have to bring them back.

117
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,590
And I'm gonna do everything in
my power to help you do that.

118
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,900
Why?

119
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,170
"Why"?

120
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,650
Why would you help me?

121
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,740
Because there's a war coming, john.

122
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,090
And if you're not back on
the island when that happens,

123
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,290
the wrong side is going to win.

124
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,150
"jeremy bentham"?

125
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,380
He was a british philosopher.

126
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,720
Your parents had a sense of humor
when they named you, so why can't I?

127
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,850
This should be money enough for now.

128
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,560
The phone's international.

129
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,380
If you need to reach me,
for anything, just press 2-3.

130
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:36,410
The folder contains your people's whereabouts,
everyone that was on the island that left.

131
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,880
You've been watching them?

132
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,710
I'm deeply invested in the
future of the island, john.

133
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,980
So, yes, I've been watching them.

134
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,570
I wouldn't mention I'm involved in this.

135
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,950
I can't imagine what they think of
me, having listened to benjamin's lies.

136
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,090
How do I know that you're
not the one who's lying?

137
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,750
I haven't tried to kill you.

138
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,590
Would you say the same for him?

139
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,980
you still don't trust me.

140
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,900
You sent a team of killers and
a boatload of c4 to the island.

141
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,940
That... doesn't exactly scream "trust."

142
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,540
I needed linus removed...

143
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,780
so it could be your time.

144
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,320
Right.

145
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,320
The island needs you, john.

146
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,250
It has for a long time.

147
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,150
What makes you think I'm so special?

148
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,620
Because you are.

149
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,950
Your chariot has arrived.

150
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,140
He said I would die.

151
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,490
I beg your pardon?

152
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:54,030
Richard alpert. He said the only way
to get them to come back was if I died.

153
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,990
I don't know why he said that,
but I'm not gonna let that happen.

154
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,690
This is matthew abaddon.

155
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,060
He'll take you anywhere you need to go, protect
you from whomever intends to do you harm.

156
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,590
Mr. Locke.

157
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,750
good luck, john, and godspeed.

158
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,720
Anything you need, mr.
Locke, you just let me know.

159
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,220
Anything.

160
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,280
Anybody from your past you
want me to look up for you?

161
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,330
The whole world thinks
you're dead, mr. Locke.

162
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,220
There must be somebody
who'd be happy to see you.

163
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,600
Please don't talk to me.

164
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,060
You got it.

165
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,070
but we're almost at the airport, so you're gonna
at least have to tell me where we're ing first.

166
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,400
Santo domingo.

167
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,210
<i>******</i>

168
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,590
espera. Necesito terminar este techo.

169
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,990
P*seme otra viga.

170
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,340
hey, sayid!

171
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,990
Mira! Tienes un visitante.

172
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,830
I don't believe this. You
actually want me to go back?

173
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,040
I-I know how it sounds, sayid,
but you have to trust me.

174
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,760
This is the only way to save them.

175
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,130
I'm not going back.

176
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,510
For two years, I was manipulated into thinking
I was protecting everyone on the island.

177
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,490
Who was manipulating you?

178
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,950
Ben.

179
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,500
So who is manipulating you, john?

180
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,320
This is coming from me, nobody else.

181
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,370
I know you, sayid.

182
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,510
And deep down in your heart, you know
we never should've left the island.

183
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,170
It's only because I left the island that I
was finally able to marry the woman I loved.

184
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,060
We spent nine months together-- the
best nine months of my life, john.

185
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,460
That's what I know in my heart.

186
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,740
where is she now?

187
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,970
She was murdered.

188
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,390
I'm sorry.

189
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,080
Why do you really need to go back?

190
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,320
Is it just because you
have nowhere else to go?

191
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,640
If you change your mind, I'll be staying
under the name "jeremy bentham" in L.A.

192
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,060
At the westerfield hotel.

193
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,220
And if you change your mind, you're welcome
to come back here and do some real good.

194
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,980
Good-bye, john.

195
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,490
<i>******</i>

196
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,930
You asked if there was someone
you could look up for me.

197
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,990
Yes, I did.

198
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,960
Her name is helen-- helen norwood--
and she was living in los angeles.

199
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,320
She an old girlfriend of yours?

200
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,850
help me get out of the car.

201
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,430
so that's michael dawson's son, huh?

202
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,210
Yeah. Boy's gotten big.

203
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,260
Um, I'm--I'm-a be
right back. I'm-a go.

204
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,110
I'll give you two some privacy.

205
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,130
- hey, john.
- Hi, walt.

206
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,220
- What happened?
- I hurt my leg.

207
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,150
You don't seem surprised to see me.

208
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,750
I've been having dreams about you.

209
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,600
You were on the island, wearing a suit,
and there are people all around you.

210
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,940
They wanted to hurt you, john.

211
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,180
Good thing they're just dreams.

212
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Is my dad... is he back on the island?

213
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,090
I haven't talked to him in three years.

214
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,660
I figured he must've gone back.

215
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,280
Um, last I heard, your dad was
on a freighter near the island.

216
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,330
So why'd you come to see me?

217
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,920
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

218
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,810
Yeah. I'm doing pretty good.

219
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,120
Well, I gotta go. It was
good seeing you, john.

220
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,480
Yeah. Take care.

221
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,070
I take it you didn't invite him along.

222
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,630
Boy's been through enough.

223
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,410
That's 0-for-2,
mr. Locke.

224
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,970
Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought
you had to bring everyone back.

225
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I only need to convince one. And if
I can do that, the rest will come.

226
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,540
And maybe i was mistaken, but
I thought you we my driver.

227
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,770
<i>******</i>

228
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,360
hello, hugo.

229
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,200
So you didn't make it, huh?

230
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,910
Pardon me?

231
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,720
You didn't make it.
It's cool. No biggie.

232
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,910
You're not the first person
to visit me, you know.

233
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,460
But what's up with the wheelchair?

234
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,630
Uh, I broke my leg falling down a hole.

235
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,840
Is that how you died?

236
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,850
Hugo, I'm not dead.

237
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,210
Sure you're not.

238
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,240
No, I-I promise you,
I'm very much alive.

239
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,740
Hey, susie, am I talking to a
dude in a wheelchair right now?

240
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,830
Yep.

241
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,850
Whoa, dude. What are you doing here?

242
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,670
I need you to come back
to the island with me.

243
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,960
Wait. What?

244
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,550
And not just you, but
everybody who left.

245
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,940
- You mean jack and
kate-- - everybody.

246
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm sorry, dude. I don't
think that's gonna happen.

247
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,160
Jack's a doctor now, and--and sun's,
like, got her baby, and kate's got aaron.

248
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,730
dude, be cool. Don't look,
but we're being watched.

249
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,530
dude!

250
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,900
- Oh, don't worry. He's with me.
- What?

251
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,650
He's just driving me around. He's okay.

252
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,020
That dude is far from okay.

253
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,120
When I first got locked up in here, he showed
up, claiming that he worked for oceanic air.

254
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,580
He's evil!

255
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,040
You should not be trusting that guy.

256
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,460
- Please, just listen to me.
- No, no, no! I'm not listening to you!

257
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,860
- Hugo, please, listen.
- La, la, la, la, la I wanna go back in.

258
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,180
- I wanna go
back in. - Hugo--

259
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,950
no, I'm not going anywhere
with you! Go away! Bye!

260
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,010
- Get out of here!
- You're safe.

261
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,100
That's three visits now.

262
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:01,360
you may wanna step up your game, mr.
Locke, or we're all in serious trouble.

263
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,730
what exactly is it that you
do for mr. Widmore, matthew?

264
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,290
you're ready to talk about it now, huh?

265
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,450
John...

266
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,170
you're not really gonna
pretend you don't remember

267
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,720
that I was an orderly in the
hospital right after your accident?

268
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,010
That I was the one who told
you to go on your walkabout?

269
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,250
The same walkabout that put you on
the plane that crashed on that island?

270
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,340
No. I remember.

271
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:37,130
I help people get to where
they need to get to, john.

272
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,990
That's what I do for mr. Widmore.

273
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,650
<i>******</i>

274
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,310
the answer is no.

275
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,880
Kate, I don't think
you understand--

276
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,780
no, you made yourself perfectly clear.

277
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,190
Everyone on the island is
gonna die if I don't go back.

278
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,700
And the answer is no.

279
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,750
Why? Don't you care about them?

280
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,720
- Have you ever been in love, john?
- What?

281
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,240
I think about you sometimes.

282
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,080
I think about how desperate
you were to stay on that island.

283
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,920
And then I realized...

284
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,060
it was all because you
didn't love anybody.

285
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:49,070
That's not true.

286
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,530
I loved someone...

287
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,390
once.

288
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,920
Her name was helen.

289
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,700
What happened?

290
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,850
Well... it--it... it
just didn't work out.

291
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,520
Why not, john?

292
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,030
I was angry. I was...

293
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,550
ob-obsessed.

294
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,250
And look how far you've come.

295
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,590
Let me help you, mr. Locke.

296
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,020
- did you find her?
- Find who?

297
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,850
Helen norwood--the
woman I asked you about.

298
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,530
No, I didn'T. I'm sorry.

299
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,200
three years is a long time.

300
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,980
It's possible she got
married, changed her name.

301
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:05,180
- Maybe she moved out of state.
- You found everyone else! All of them.

302
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,130
Sayid was in the middle of nowhere, but
you can't find helen because she moved?

303
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,070
Your job is to get people
to where they need to get to?

304
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,650
Well, I need to get to her.

305
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,650
<i>******</i>

306
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,100
what happened to her?

307
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,670
She died of a brain aneurysm.

308
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,320
I'm very sorry, mr. Locke.

309
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,250
She loved me.

310
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,900
If I had just...

311
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,470
we could've been together.

312
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,690
Maybe you could have.

313
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,140
That wouldn't change
anything. She'd still be gone.

314
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,420
Would she?

315
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,800
Helen is where she's supposed to be.

316
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,000
As sad ait is, her path led here.

317
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,160
And you path, no matter what you did or what
you do, your path leads back to the island.

318
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,610
You say that like it's
all det--inevitable.

319
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,430
Mr. Widmore told me richard alpert
said that you were going to die.

320
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,350
So you tell me, john.

321
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,590
Is that inevitable, or is it a choice?

322
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,130
What, you think i wanna die?

323
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,770
How is that...

324
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,130
how could you possibly
think that's a choice?

325
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,460
I'm just your driver.

326
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,390
matthew!

327
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,980
what are you doing here?

328
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,280
jack, how did you find me?

329
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:29,260
You were in a car accident and
you were brought into my hospital.

330
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,710
What are you doing here?

331
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,350
we have to go back.

332
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,000
of course. Of course we do.

333
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,350
Jack, the people I
left behind ne our help.

334
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,100
- We're supposed to go back--
- because it's our destiny?

335
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,650
How many times are you
gonna say that to me, john?

336
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,780
How can you not see it?

337
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,900
Of all the hospitals they could've
brought me to, I end up here.

338
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,170
You don't think that's fate?

339
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,440
Your car accident was on
the west side of los angeles.

340
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,810
You being brought into my
hospital isn't fate, john.

341
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,260
- It's probability.
- You don't understand. It wasn't an accident.

342
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,880
- Someone is trying to kill me.
- Why? Why would someone try to kill you?

343
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,060
Because they don't want me to succeed.

344
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,450
They wanna stop me.

345
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,550
They don't want me to get
back because I'm important.

346
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,210
Have you ever stopped to
think that these delusions

347
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,610
that you're special aren't real?

348
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,210
That maybe there's nothing
important about you at all?

349
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,910
Maybe you are just a lonely old
man that crashed on an island.

350
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,960
That's it.

351
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,140
Good-bye, john.

352
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,430
Your father says hello.

353
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,540
What?

354
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,180
A man--the man who told me to move the island--
the man who told me how to bring you all back--

355
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,490
he said to tell his son hello.

356
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,000
It couldn't have been sayid's father, and
it wasn't hurley's, so that leaves you.

357
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,130
He said his name was christian.

358
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,940
My... my father is dead.

359
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,030
Well, he didn't look dead to me.

360
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,340
he died in australia three years
ago. I put him in the coffin!

361
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,350
He's dead.

362
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,490
Jack, please, you have to come back!

363
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,580
You're the only one who can
convince the rest of 'em.

364
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,400
You have to help me!
You're supposed to help me!

365
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,230
John, it's over! It's done.

366
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,900
We left, and we were
never important. So you...

367
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,470
you leave me alone.

368
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,150
And you leave the rest of 'em alone!

369
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,760
<i>******</i>

370
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,550
john? John?

371
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,900
♪♪♪♪♪♪

372
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,630
wait, please. John, stop!

373
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,370
h-how did you find me?

374
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,970
I have a man watching sayid.

375
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,270
I'm watching all of
them,keeping them safe.

376
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,430
When you turned up, he called me.

377
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,330
Who... who... w-w-what
are you doing here?

378
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,190
- John, just calm down.
- What do you want from me?

379
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,250
- Please, let me help--
- answer the question!

380
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,860
I'm trying to protect you.

381
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,490
Protect me?

382
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,830
You shot him.

383
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,760
You killed abaddon.

384
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:02,230
Yes. Yes, I did.

385
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,780
But it was only a matter of
time before he tried to kill you.

386
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,920
I was just trying to get to you,
but you drove off and crashed.

387
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,250
- Why?Why would-- - he was
working for charles widmore.

388
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,240
- He's extremely dangerous.
- No!

389
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,680
Widmore came to me. He saved me.

390
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,090
No, john, he used you.

391
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,790
He waited till you showed up so that
you could help him get to the island.

392
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,280
Charles widmore is the
reason I moved the island!

393
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:30,060
So that he could never find it again,
to keep him away so that you could lead.

394
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,170
You can't do this.

395
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,090
If anything happens to you...

396
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:49,460
john, you have no idea
how important you are.

397
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,850
Let me help you.

398
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,120
there is no helping me.

399
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,450
I'M...

400
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480
I'm a failure.

401
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,960
- No, john, you're not.
- I am!

402
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,860
I couldn't get any of them. I couldn't get
a single one of them to come back with me.

403
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,090
Lead anyone.

404
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,440
Jack booked a ticket.

405
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,510
W-what?

406
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,830
A plane ticket from los
angeles to sydney, tonight.

407
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,790
Return trip first thing in the morning.

408
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,780
Whatever you said to
him, john--it worked.

409
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,440
And if you got jack, you
can get the rest of them.

410
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,610
john... you can't die.

411
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,810
You've got too much work to do.

412
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:59,260
We've gotta get you back to that
island so that you can do it.

413
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,910
please, john. Come on.

414
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,930
come down.

415
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,210
I know we can do this, john.

416
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,000
you haven't even been to sun yet.

417
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,230
- Let's start with her.
- No.

418
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,510
I...

419
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,510
I promised jin that I
wouldn't bring her back.

420
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,550
- Jin is alive?
- Yeah.

421
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,560
Yeah. But he didn't want her to know.
He--he wanted me to tell her that his...

422
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,600
that his body washed up on the beach.

423
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,650
And, uh, he gave me his
wedding ring to prove it.

424
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,750
All right.

425
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,520
a promise is a promise.

426
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,630
thank you.

427
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:33,030
you're welcome.

428
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,250
Come on.

429
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,290
let's go.

430
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,640
I know we can do this.

431
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,040
once we can get them
all in the same place...

432
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,910
I don't know where we go from there,
but we'll figure something out.

433
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,280
I know where we go.

434
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,130
There's a woman here in los angeles.

435
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,990
- A woman?
- Yeah, I don't know exactly where,

436
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,170
but she shouldn't be that hard
to find. Her name is--is, uh...

437
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,910
eloise hawking.

438
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,480
Eloise hawking? You sure?

439
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,470
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, why? Do you know her?

440
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,880
Yes. John. I know her.

441
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,580
I'll miss yo johN.

442
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,380
I really will.

443
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,730
that symbol-- it belongs to an
organization called the dharma initiative.

444
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,630
They were conducting some
experiments here a while back.

445
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,290
How do you know that?

446
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,200
I spent more than a hundred days
on this island. I know a lot.

447
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,830
A hundd days?

448
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,100
So when we crashed,
you were already here.

449
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,210
No. No, I, uH... I left.

450
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,620
How long ago did you leave?

451
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,620
the timing would just confuse ya.

452
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,690
Well... how did you get back?

453
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,750
To be honest, that part's
a bit of a mystery to me.

454
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,690
Okay, john locke...

455
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:18,850
I have a mystery, too.

456
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,180
Maybe you can help me with it.

457
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,680
I'm happy to try.

458
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,490
On the plane, I was sitting across the aisle
from that really big guy with curly hair.

459
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,050
When the plane started
shaki-- really shaking--

460
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,170
there was a big noise
and a bright light.

461
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,690
And this really big
guy with curly hair...

462
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,610
was gone, man. I mean, literally gone.

463
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,090
And it wasn't only him.

464
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,350
Some of us saw it happen
to other people, too.

465
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,850
So, mr. John locke, do you have
an idea about what happened?

466
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,800
I think...

467
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,990
I might know how I came to be here.

468
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,810
But that would involve
me finding my friends.

469
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,860
- Do you have a-a-a
passenger list? - No.

470
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,560
The pilot took it when he ran off.

471
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,770
And everyone's accounted
for-- all the people?

472
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,940
O-other than the--the
ones who disappeared.

473
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,730
Yeah, yeah, except for
the people who got hurt.
