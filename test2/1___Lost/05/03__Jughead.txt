1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,300
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,170
whatever ben linus did down at the orchid station,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
It may have... dislodged us.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,360
The island is moving through time?

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah, either the island is, or we are.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,040
I need you to go back to oxford university.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,780
Go back to where we met!

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,810
I need you to go there and find my mother! her name is--

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,110
Are you all right?

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,550
I was on the island. you've been off the island for three years.

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,080
You're safe now. it was just a dream.

12
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,680
It wasn't a dream, pen.

13
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,780
It was a memory.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,980
Efren salonga
Efren salonga?

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,610
Efren salonga
Ef-efren salonga!

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,210
Efren salonga
Efren salonga?

17
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,880
Efren salonga
Efren salonga!

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,350
Efren salonga
Efren salonga!

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,840
Efren salonga
Efren salonga!

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,710
Efren salonga
Efren salonga?

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,410
Who are you?

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,880
Are you the doctor?

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,350
Yes.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,310
What's the matter with you?

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,240
You're sure you know what you're doing, yeah?

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,210
- Yes, yes! - Because there's a lot of blood, man!

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,510
- How much blood? - I'm coming, penny!

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,650
It's okay, pen. we've got a doctor.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,780
Where have you been?!

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,680
It's gonna be okay. it's gonna be okay. okay, here you go.

31
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,840
Okay. just breathe, penny, okay? j-just breathe.

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,810
Oh! breathe.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,040
- I can't breathe. - You're doing great. you're doing great, okay.

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,780
Okay, just be strong, yeah? okay.

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,710
- Make it come out. - Please be strong.

36
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,650
Hold it. hold it.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,210
I can't!

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,210
Yes, you-- yes, you can, penny.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,840
Push! push!

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,410
Okay, push now, penny. push. now!

41
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,880
Come on, penny. that's it. it's coming.

42
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,710
Push harder! come on, penny. push!

43
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,880
I can see the head! I can see the head!

44
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,940
- One more time! push! - I can see it. it's just coming.

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,510
It's coming! it'coming!

46
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,480
You did it.

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,450
You did it.

48
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,650
Oh, my god, penny. you did it.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,980
It's a boy.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,480
I love you, penny. I love you.

51
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, oh, he's beautiful. beautiful.

52
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,810
Oh, my god. he's so beautiful.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,610
Oh, my god.

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,710
I love you.

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,210
I love you.

56
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,350
I love you.

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,310
Look.

58
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,940
Right out there.

59
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,610
Beyond where you can see, there's--there's an island,

60
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,480
And it's a very special island.

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,040
I left it a long time ago.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,750
I never thought I'd see it again.

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,980
It's called great britain.

64
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,380
And the most beautiful part of the island is scotland,

65
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,380
And that's where your daddy's from.

66
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,680
There's mountains and glens and monsters in deep lochs,

67
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,240
And...

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,480
And it's where your mommy and daddy...

69
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,010
Fell in love.

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,350
It's also where he broke her heart.

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,310
Yeah, well, i...

72
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,110
I thought I'd leave that wee bit out of it.

73
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,610
You also left out the bit about his grandfather--

74
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,080
The man who sent a boat to the island

75
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,080
To kill all daddy's friends.

76
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,480
We'll be in and out. he'll never know we're here, penny.

77
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:27,710
Don't underestimate him, desmond.

78
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,750
If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do.

79
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,750
But this has nothing to do with your father, penny.

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,940
We are here because of daniel faraday.

81
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,310
What he told me--

82
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,510
That everyone on that island is in danger,

83
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,810
And I am the only one that can help them.

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,710
I have to do this, penny.

85
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,940
Are you sure that's what he said?

86
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,450
Yeah, sawyer said to meet at the creek,

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,940
So unless he got torched by a flaming arrow,

88
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,980
That's where he and everyone else should be.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
Hey, how's your headache?

90
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,810
Worse, actually.

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,110
But considering we're running for our lives,

92
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm not gonna complain.

93
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,880
You have any dizziness or double vision?

94
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,080
Both, actually.

95
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,750
Why do you look so worried?

96
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,940
Is it because you know what's happening to me?

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,180
Listen to me. nothing is gonna happen to you. nothing.

98
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,350
I won't let it.

99
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,010
Hey, we're here!

100
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,640
Some rendezvous. it's just us.

101
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,980
Well, we should probably wait, see if they show up.

102
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,950
They could be right behind us.

103
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,980
- Yeah, or they came and left. or they're dead.

104
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,110
Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude...

105
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,580
Not exactly what we need right now.

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,880
People are scared enough as it is. miles--

107
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,510
Miles
Miles?

108
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,050
Wait! don't move! aah!

109
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,910
Who's in charge here?

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,880
He is.

111
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,840
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,830
Did he finish his breakfast?

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,260
Yeah.

114
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,390
Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end...

115
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,490
Unlike his father.

116
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,590
Look, honey,

117
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,360
All I have to do is find his mother,

118
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,360
Tell her he's still on the island,

119
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,390
- And then I'm done with this for good.  - why now?

120
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,390
I mean, if he told you all this on the island,

121
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,900
Why didn't you remember it until two days ago?

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,860
I don't know.

123
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,860
Look, I don't understand how any of this works

124
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,360
Any more than you do. it...

125
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,390
Look, I know it happened.

126
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,160
Daniel faraday knocked on the hatch door

127
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,360
And told me to go to oxford...

128
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,930
Everyone was in danger,

129
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,460
And I was the only one that could save them.

130
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,960
I know how insane it sounds.

131
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,060
I'll be back by dark,

132
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,960
And then I'm done...

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,860
Forever.

134
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,760
I promise.

135
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,730
If you're gonna promise me something, des,

136
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again?

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,360
Why in god's name would I ever go back there?

138
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,130
There were 20 of you at the beach,

139
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,130
But only five of you here.

140
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,230
Where are the rest of your people?

141
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,490
Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines.

142
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,730
We didn't put them here. you did.

143
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,830
Once we leave here,

144
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,830
I will be out of control of what happens to you.

145
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,360
But if you cooperate now,

146
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,900
Things will go much easier for you.

147
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,560
So where are the rest of your people?

148
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,430
I don't know.

149
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,000
Who are these people?

150
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that,

151
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,000
With frogurt on fire and all.

152
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,000
They attacked us on the beach.

153
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,960
This is a 30-caliber m1 garand rifle. it looks new.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who cares about the rifle? where the hell you been?

155
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,860
If you've been going through what I have, james,

156
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,690
Maybe the more appropriate question would be,

157
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,690
When the hell have I been?

158
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,560
- What happened to your leg?  - I got shot.

159
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,900
- By who?  - we can swap stories later.

160
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,960
We told the rest of our group that we would meet them

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,560
At the creek. if there's any chance

162
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,250
Of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving.

163
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,360
Fine, seeing as we have no rope

164
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,930
To make sure these two don't try to kill us again.

165
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,200
- Guess we're gonna have to shoot 'em.  - quare non sunt vestitus eis?

166
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,960
- Tace!  - what?

167
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,730
- What kind of language is that?  - they're speaking latin.

168
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,530
That one asked why we aren't in uniform,

169
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,660
And this one told him to shut up.

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,160
And how is it that they know how to speak latin, juliet?

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,730
The same reason I do.

172
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,690
Because they're others.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,590
- Hey.  - yeah.

174
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,560
- We just walked over a fresh grave.  - what?

175
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,960
Four u.s. soldiers,

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,360
Dead just under a month.

177
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,530
Three of them were shot.

178
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,390
One died of radiation poisoning.

179
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,860
Miles, hey, hey.

180
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Did any of them happen to mention what year it is?

181
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,760
We're here.

182
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,100
Richard? we're back.

183
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,430
Caught the three by the creek.

184
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,490
This one's their leader.

185
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,830
What's your name?

186
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,260
What's your name?

187
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,900
My name is Richard Alpert.

188
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,330
I assume you've come back for your bomb.

189
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,390
No, I'm sorry, sir.

190
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,430
I'm not finding a record of any faraday.

191
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,060
No, that--that's impossible.

192
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,800
'cause I know her son was a professor here.

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,900
His name's Daniel Faraday. I'm sure he's in your database.

194
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Sir, there's no record of any Faraday

195
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,600
Ever having been employed here at oxford.

196
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,330
I visited him.

197
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,460
I went to his lab. it was in an attic.

198
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,190
It was...  it was above the physics department.

199
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,230
The archives go back quite far.

200
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,530
Perhaps there was a clerical error.

201
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,490
You don't happen to recall the year

202
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,460
In which you last visited?

203
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,330
The year?

204
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,790
No. I'm...

205
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,490
I'm not exactly sure.

206
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,790
May I ask why you're seeking this information?

207
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,360
Sorry I wasted your time.

208
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,100
Yeah, I wouldn't touch that.

209
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
I wondered when someone'd figure out

210
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,200
Were weren't just fumigating here.

211
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,390
You a professor?

212
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,200
No. not exactly.

213
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,060
At least you're honest.

214
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,530
So why'd you tell me not to touch it?

215
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,460
Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made

216
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:10,230
Run through this bloody thing down to the incinerator

217
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,000
So that no one would find out what he was up to. you mean daniel faraday.

218
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,960
Yeah. you're not the first one to poke around here,

219
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Asking about him and his work.

220
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,300
Rumor had it, he was trying to send rats' brains back in time.

221
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,430
Ridiculous, innit?

222
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,430
Aye.

223
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,900
Look, I'll forget you broke my lock

224
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,360
If you tell your mates that all you found

225
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,630
Was rubbish left behind by a madman.

226
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,900
Fair enough.

227
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,330
Faraday
Faraday--

228
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,760
The university says there's no record of him.

229
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,760
Well, can you blame 'em?

230
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,490
I mean, after what he'd done to that poor girl?

231
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,730
What girl?

232
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,830
Hey, take it easy.

233
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,390
It's all right, dan. I'm fine.

234
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,360
We are so dead.

235
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,330
Hey. no, no, no.

236
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,860
We are not so dead. we're gonna be fine.

237
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,790
We just need to keep it together until there's another flash.

238
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,790
All right? then all this disappears.

239
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,930
And when's that gonna happen? could be five minutes.

240
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,230
Could also be 5,000 years.

241
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,200
That's--that's just awesome.

242
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,160
What is going on, dan?

243
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,230
Why are they doing this to us? I'm not sure.

244
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,100
But they must think that we're with the american military.

245
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,390
And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive

246
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,730
Is to let them keep thinking it, all right? let--

247
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,630
Sorry. am I interrupting?

248
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,860
Ellie tells me that you're not willing to reveal

249
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,830
Where the rest your squad is.

250
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,390
And why would I do that? so you can kill them, too?

251
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,530
We didn't start this, friend. your people attacked us.

252
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,860
You come to our island to run your tests,

253
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,830
You fire on us, and what,

254
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,030
You expect us notto defend ourselves?

255
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,460
I don't know anything about that. we are scientists.

256
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,930
So what? so they sent you here to recover it?

257
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,900
If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes.

258
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,930
And I'm guessing from this man's radiation burns

259
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,900
That the housing has been compromised.

260
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,390
Is that right?

261
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,760
You need to listen to me.

262
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,730
You have an unstable device

263
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
That's capable of destroying this entire island,

264
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,460
And it's broken.

265
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,430
If you don't allow me to render it inert,

266
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,560
All of us are gonna die.

267
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,230
All of us. how do I know you weren't sent here on some suicide mission?

268
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,690
That I'll take you out to the bomb,

269
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,300
And you'll just detonate it?

270
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,560
Because...

271
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,790
I'm in love with the woman sitting next to me.

272
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,230
And I would never...

273
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,690
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

274
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,260
All right.

275
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,230
Take care of your bomb.

276
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,230
But you try anything else, and you will hurt her.

277
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,360
So who taught you latin?

278
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,300
Others 101.

279
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,060
Gotta learn latin-- language of the enlightened.

280
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,430
Enlightened, my ass.

281
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,490
I suggest you talk to us.

282
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,530
Once we get back to the creek

283
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,530
And meet up with the rest of our people,

284
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,860
There's gonna be a lot of anger directed at you

285
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,000
For attacking them. the rest of your people

286
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,030
Are either captured or dead. what?

287
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,630
What makes you say that?

288
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,730
That idiot shouted out, "meet at the creek."

289
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,860
We knew exactly where they were headed.

290
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,860
Sent a group after them.

291
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,630
Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language. james, wait.

292
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,640
then let us go

293
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,790
What the hell are you sayin'?

294
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,030
take us to your camp

295
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,070
please

296
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,610
why would i do that

297
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,060
is

298
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,150
...Richard there£¿

299
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,770
Richard Alpert
Richard Alpert?

300
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,930
Did you just say "richard alpert"?

301
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,790
John, please.

302
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,110
bring us to your camp

303
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,700
no one else has to die

304
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,300
please

305
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,000
All right.

306
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,360
Okay, we need to head east another couple of kilometers

307
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,860
Unl we hit the ridge--

308
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,000
Shoot him!

309
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,930
Shoot, damn it!

310
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,690
Are you crazy?! what were you thinking?

311
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,760
Why didn't you shoot him?!

312
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,490
Because...

313
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,430
He's one of my people.

314
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,960
And who might you be?

315
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,590
Uh, my name's desmond hume. I'm looking for Theresa Spencer.

316
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,660
I'm Abigail Spencer. Theresa's my sister.

317
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:21,360
Oh, right. um, can I have a word with her?

318
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,890
You wanna speak to Theresa?

319
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,890
Yeah, I got her name

320
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,890
From a-a gentleman I met at oxford university--

321
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,860
Um... Daniel Faraday.

322
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,830
Daniel Faraday
Daniel Faraday?

323
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,100
Well, why didn't you say so?

324
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,830
Please, you must come in.

325
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,760
Thanks.

326
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,160
He didn't tell you, did he?

327
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,690
No. no, he didn't.

328
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,860
Can she hear us?

329
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,000
No. Theresa's away right now.

330
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,590
"away"? what do you mean?

331
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,560
Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3,

332
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,830
Wants to know where her dolly is.

333
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,030
Yesterday, she was talking to our dad.

334
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,630
He died five years ago.

335
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,590
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:26,590
Um, this was a mistake. i... I shouldn't have come.

337
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,860
Of course.

338
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,660
Why would you want to stay?

339
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,730
Daniel certainly didn't.

340
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,360
He left her like this?

341
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,560
Went running off to the states, never to be heard from again.

342
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,000
He abandoned her.

343
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:46,930
What kind of a man does that?

344
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,560
I seriously don't know what we would've done

345
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,790
If it hadn't been for mr. widmore.

346
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,660
Uh, I'm sorry. who?

347
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,830
Daniel's benefactor.

348
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,490
He funded his research,

349
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:02,530
And he took responsibility for the result of it.

350
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,860
He's been taking care of Theresa ever since this happened to her.

351
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,530
Everything here is due to Mr. Widmore,

352
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,200
God bless him.

353
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,030
A hydrogen bomb?

354
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,860
Seriously?

355
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,830
Back in the '50s,

356
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,300
The U.S. government tested h-bombs in the south pacific.

357
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Lucky us.

358
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,260
You didn't have to say that.

359
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,560
Say what?

360
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,060
That you loved me.

361
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,400
I mean, there are plenty of other ways

362
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,400
You could've convinced him

363
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,690
You weren't gonna blow up the entire island.

364
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,860
I said what I said

365
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,860
Because I meant it, Charlotte.

366
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,000
Right, then.

367
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,730
Let's go.

368
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,860
Back soon. I promise.

369
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,760
Whatever your, uh, your superiors told you,

370
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,200
I want you to know the truth.

371
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,830
A month ago, we found 18 members of an army battalion

372
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,060
Right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp.

373
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,030
We gave them the opportunity to leave the island peacefully.

374
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,030
They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill 'em.

375
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,860
All of 'em.

376
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,330
- Forced? - Yeah.

377
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,030
By whom?

378
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,000
Y-you answer to someone, don't you?

379
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,630
You follow a chain of command, right?

380
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,590
- Yeah. - yeah, well, so do i.

381
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,400
Richard  Richard
Richard! Richard!

382
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,630
What the hell happened to you?

383
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,200
Cunningham and i-- a group of them surprised us.

384
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:15,660
We were outnumbered, but I escaped.

385
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,760
- Outnumbered, eh? - Shut up, Ellie.

386
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,660
- Who's this? - He's gonna help us take care of our problem.

387
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,330
- You'd better get going. - Wait. he's one of them.

388
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,430
You can't actually trust him.

389
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah, you heard me, Ellie. go.

390
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,130
- H-how did you escape? - I ran.

391
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,630
And it never occurred to you that they might follow you?

392
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,100
Follow me? Their leader is some sodding old man.

393
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,260
What, you think he can track me?

394
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,260
You think he knows this island better than I do?

395
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,160
How did you know Richard would be here?

396
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,790
Richard's always been here.

397
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,300
How old is he?

398
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,860
Old.

399
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,490
Why are you so interested in Richard, John?

400
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,130
I'm interested in him

401
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,430
Because he was about to tell me how I could save us.

402
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,590
"save us"?

403
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,930
Yeah.

404
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,890
But before he could finish,

405
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,130
We were interrupted by that flash of light.

406
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,790
- And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off. - I hate to bust up

407
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,030
The "i'm an other, you're an other" reunion,

408
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,060
But Faraday--the guy that's actually gonna save us--

409
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,730
Is being death marched into the jungle right now.

410
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,400
Good luck with that.

411
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,960
You're not gonna help me save him?

412
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,030
No.I'm gonna go down

413
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,060
finish my conversation with richard.

414
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,330
That's gonna get us all killed.

415
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,330
You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here.

416
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,860
Fair enough. I'll give you ten minutes head start.

417
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,660
What about you?

418
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,530
You wanna stay here in crazytown

419
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,730
Or help me rescue the geek?

420
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,730
Why do you keep looking at me?

421
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,690
No, no, I'm--i'm not. i--

422
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,100
You are.

423
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,560
You know what? you're right. I'm--i'm sorry.

424
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,830
It's just...

425
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,860
You look so much like...

426
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,860
Someone I used to know.

427
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,480
Someone other than the girl

428
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,060
you just professed your love for?

429
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,930
- Well, aren't you the romeo.  - far from it, believe me.

430
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,160
I don't believe you, by the way.

431
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
You may have richard fooled,

432
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,260
You can't really expect me to believe

433
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,760
That you, a british woman and a chinese man

434
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,230
Are all members of the united states military.

435
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,890
Who are you

436
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,400
And what are you doing on our island?

437
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,300
You wanna know who I am?

438
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,930
I'm your best chance

439
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,060
At disarming that bomb.

440
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:54,890
Right, then,

441
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,830
Disarm it.

442
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,030
What are you doing up there?

443
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,760
I'm examining it.

444
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,430
- Back up. - What?

445
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,230
Get back, get back.

446
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,460
It's unsafe. we need to move.

447
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,260
I swear, if you try anything...

448
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,890
If I try anything--

449
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:13,860
What, you're gonna-- you're gonna shoot me?

450
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,530
Is that right?

451
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,600
Yeah, that would be perfect because, of course,

452
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,930
Rifle fire right next to-- what would you call this--

453
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Hydrogen bomb? yes, fantastic idea.

454
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,730
Really... inspired.

455
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,530
Okay, listen to me.

456
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,730
- Do you people have any access to lead or concrete? - for what?

457
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,990
There's a crack in the casing. it needs to be filled with lead.

458
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,500
You need to take it off this platform carefully

459
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,430
- And bury it. - You brought me all the way out here

460
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,690
To tell us that we have to bury it?

461
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,360
- You told Alpert you could disarm that thing. - You don't need to worry.

462
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,530
You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off.

463
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,990
- How do you know that? - I need you to trust me.

464
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,650
I don't trust you.

465
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,890
just bury it. bury it, and everything will be fine.

466
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,080
Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this.

467
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,060
How can you be so sure?

468
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,380
You wanna take care of this bomb? you bury it!

469
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,330
How?! how do you know that?

470
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,790
Because 50 years from now, this island is still here!

471
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,860
There you...

472
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,760
What did you just say?

473
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,160
Whoa. take it easy.

474
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,130
I can explain myself a little better.

475
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,090
I know how this sounds.

476
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,690
Believe me, it's... oh, it's hard to explain.

477
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,330
50 years from now,

478
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,790
Me and my..

479
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,860
Me and my friends--

480
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,060
That's where we're from, okay?

481
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,360
And here's the key-- everything's fine.

482
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,860
I'm not saying it's perfectly fine,

483
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,830
But there hasn't been any atomic blasts, all right?

484
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,130
There has not-- drop the gun, blondie.

485
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,160
It's okay.

486
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
She's okay. you can put your gun down.

487
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,260
She puts hers down first.

488
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,430
Why don't we all put our guns down?

489
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,990
I said, drop it!

490
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,890
Son of a bitch.

491
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,330
Are they from the future, too?

492
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,400
You told her?

493
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,090
Sir! sir, you can't--

494
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,530
Mr. widmore.

495
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,230
I'm so sorry. he charged right past me.

496
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,860
That's all right, melanie.

497
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,230
Mr. hume is a... colleague of mine.

498
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,860
Please leave us.

499
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,860
I know you have questions for me.

500
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,860
I'm not gonna answer them.

501
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,330
I've come here to ask you something.

502
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,300
And once you've told me everything I need to know,

503
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,890
You'll never see me again.

504
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,400
Understand?

505
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,030
All right.

506
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,560
I need to know where I can find daniel faraday's mother.

507
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,090
What makes you think I would even know the answer to that?

508
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,060
Because even before you put faraday on your little boat

509
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,030
And sent him off to the island,

510
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,330
You spent ten years funding his research.

511
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,230
So I figure, you must know something

512
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,130
Regarding his next of kin.

513
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,160
Desmond
Desmond

514
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,730
I haven't seen or heard from my daughter for three years.

515
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,430
Just answer me this.

516
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,630
Is she safe?

517
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,230
Where's faraday's mother?

518
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,460
She's in los angeles.

519
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,560
This is an address for her.

520
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,430
I suspect she won't be pleased to see you.

521
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,760
She's a very private person.

522
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:37,930
Wait, desmond.

523
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,730
Deliver your message...

524
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,430
But then get out of this mess.

525
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,800
Don't put penny's life in danger.

526
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,730
Danger?

527
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,700
You're getting yourself involved in something

528
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,700
That goes back many, many years.

529
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,660
It has nothing to do with you or my daughter.

530
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,900
Wherever you were hiding...

531
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,860
Go back there.

532
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,630
Thanks for the advice.

533
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,860
Richard Alpert
Richard alpert!

534
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,100
- I'm looking for richard.  - don't move.

535
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,200
- Richard alpert!  - on the ground now.

536
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,160
Richard, I need to talk to you!

537
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,660
Shut your mouth!

538
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
That's enough!

539
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,030
Who are you?

540
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,230
My name is john locke.

541
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,830
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

542
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,900
Jacob sent me.

543
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,130
Put the gun down.

544
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,430
What?

545
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,530
Richard, you can't seriously trust him.

546
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,100
I said... put the gun down, widmore.

547
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,960
Your name is widmore?

548
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,460
Charles Widmore
Charles widmore?

549
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,930
What's it to you?

550
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,630
Nothing. it's... nice to meet you.

551
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,140
But it saw the bear so that it ran away again.

552
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,300
Where?

553
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,500
Good day?

554
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,340
Yeah.

555
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,770
He wanted to go fishing in the thames.

556
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,740
We were unsuccessful.

557
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,970
And you?

558
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,040
Did you find faraday's mum?

559
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,800
there was no one to find.

560
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:33,000
She, um...She died a few years ago.

561
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,940
Why are you lying to me?

562
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,440
What? I'm not.

563
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,100
Where is she?

564
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,340
She's in los angeles.

565
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Look, pen, you've got nothing to worry about.

566
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,200
You know, this was a mistake.

567
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,270
No, i... I made a promise that this would be done in a day

568
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,770
And now it's done. it's not our problem anymore.

569
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,200
And what happens if you wake up tomorrow

570
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,370
- And remember something else?  - then I'll forget it.

571
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,070
- And the next day?  - I'll forget it.

572
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,540
It doesn't matter, pen.

573
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,470
You're my life now-- you and charlie.

574
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,740
I won't leave you again...

575
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,740
Not for this...

576
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,100
Not for anything.

577
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,700
You'll never forget it, des.

578
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,540
So I guess we're going with you.

579
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,470
I gave you this?

580
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,970
Yes.

581
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,940
After you were shot in the leg

582
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,440
And i... wandered out of the jungle to patch you up?

583
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,900
That's right.

584
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,740
Then why don't I remember... well, any of this?

585
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,400
Because it hasn't happened yet.

586
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,100
I'm not sure what you're expecting me to say, john locke.

587
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,760
I expect you to tell me how to get off the island.

588
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,740
That's very privileged information.

589
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,770
Why would I share it with you?

590
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,120
Because you told me that

591
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,440
I had something very impornt to do

592
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,570
Once I get there.

593
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,440
And because I'm your leader.

594
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,370
- You're my leader?  - that's what you told me.

595
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,840
Look, i... certainly don't want to contradict myself,

596
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,570
But... we have a very specific process

597
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,200
For selecting our leadership,

598
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,540
And it starts at a very, very young age.

599
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,140
All right. all right.

600
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,440
What year is it right now?

601
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,770
It's 1954.

602
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,800
All right. may 30, 1956-- 2 years from now--

603
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,770
That's the day I'm born--

604
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,770
Tustin, california, and if you don't believe me,

605
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,270
I suggest you come and visit me.

606
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,240
Oh, no.

607
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,540
- What's wrong?  - it's about to happen again.

608
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,870
You need to tell me now, richard.

609
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,370
How do I get off the island? please! tell me!

610
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,410
You all right?

611
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,390
Yeah £¬

612
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,670
I think so

613
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,860
Charlotte

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,190

Yeah£¬I'm fine.

616
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,980
Yeah,me too.

617
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,430
I'm great too.

618
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,180
Charlotte
Charlotte

Look at me,look at me.It's ok.

622
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,660
It's ok

623
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,340
Charlotte
