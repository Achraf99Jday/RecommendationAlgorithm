1
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,180
Dude, they'll find out.

2
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,980
Not if we stick to the story.

3
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,410
I don't know, jack. it could be a risk.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,540
It's the only way. We have to do this.

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,640
they're still at it, huh?

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,610
Look, we're running out of time.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,780
We gotta make a decision now.

8
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,680
So are we all okay with this?

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,140
This is a decision that will affect the rest of our lives.

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm not taking it lightly.

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,840
Kate
Kate?

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,810
Yeah.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,480
Sun
Sun?

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,380
- Frank? - what?

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,340
Sorry you got dragged into this,

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,780
But we need to know that you're with us.

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,410
Whatever you guys decide, I'll just roll with.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,380
Hurley, what about you?

19
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,240
I don't think we should lie, dude.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,210
We need to protect the people that we left behind, hurley.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,751
How does lying protect them?

22
00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:18,580
It protects them from charles widmore.

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,940
The guy hired a boatload of people to kill all of us.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,364
He faked a plane crash.

25
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:24,440
I mean, you think telling him the truth,

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,440
He's just gonna-- he's gonna leave them alone?

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,010
Look, he's your dad, right?

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,240
Can't you, like... call him off?

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,910
There's no calling my father off.

30
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,055
But he'll never find them.

31
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:36,510
I mean, the island disappeared.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,610
We all saw it. it's gone.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,540
Bloop!

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,380
You think anyone's gonna believe that...

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,440
Believe any of it?

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,410
They're gonna think you're crazy.

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,340
Not if someone backs me up.

38
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,140
Sayid, come on.

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,410
They'll think I'm nuts if I tell the truth.

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,240
But what if we all do?

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,585
And if we can stick together,

42
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,510
we can make 'em believe us.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,075
I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying.

44
00:02:05,076 --> 00:02:07,340
- do you? - no.

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,710
But...

46
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,540
I don't believe we have a better choice.

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,310
I'm sorry, hurley, but we have to lie.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,310
You know what, dude?

49
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,510
I'm gonna remember this.

50
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,940
And someday, you're gonna need my help,

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,040
And I'm telling you right now...

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,280
You're not gettin' it.

53
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,480
Wake up, sayid!

54
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,440
Sayid
Sayid!

55
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,740
Sayid, wake up!

56
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,140
Sayid
Sayid!

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,910
No, no, no, no, no! what do I do?!

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,410
What am I supposed to do?!

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,210
Okay, okay, okay.

60
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,010
Just stay calm.

61
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,280
What the hell were you thinking?

62
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,010
- Ana lucia? - you were driving like a maniac.

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,580
And why'd you pull over?

64
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,940
I just... i-i thought--

65
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,180
You didn't think. what if I were real?

66
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,740
What if a real cop stopped you?

67
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,240
They already have pictures of you covered in blood

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,180
- With a gun in your hand. - actually, it's ketchup.

69
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,180
We went to a-a drive-thru, and, uh....

70
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,140
Well, you need to pull it together.

71
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,280
- You've got a lot of work to do. - I do?

72
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,080
Let's start with the basics. first off, you need new clothes.

73
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,440
Then you need to go to a safe place.

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,040
And take sayid to somebody you trust.

75
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,810
- You getting all this? - yeah.

76
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,810
Then get to it.

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,940
And stay away from the cops.

78
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,780
Do not get arrested.

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,280
Thanks, ana lucia.

80
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,710
Oh, yeah. libby says hi.

81
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,470
You really think that thing's gonna work?

82
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,640
Rose, I told you a hundred times.

83
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,830
Of course it's gonna work. yes. I worked hard on it.

84
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,570
It's better than rubbing two sticks together.

85
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, I heard that's what you're supposed to do with it.

86
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,780
Yeah? well, I think this is gonna work better, all right?

87
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,480
Well, I think you got too much wood here in the inside.

88
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,470
That's gonna smother the leaves.

89
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,251
Rose, if you don't have enough wood,

90
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:30,440
the leaves just burn out.

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,240
Fire? who cares about fire?

92
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,310
Any minute the sky could light up,

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,180
And who the hell knows what could happen this time?

94
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,180
Neil, we are trying to focus on what we can control.

95
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,680
You are either gonna help or be quiet!

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,040
- Whose shirt is this? - it's mine.

97
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,433
Can I have it?

98
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:48,580
what does it matter? we're all gonna be dead by sundown.

99
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,080
I'll take that as a "yes," frogurt.

100
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,880
- It's neil. - yeah, yeah.

101
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,210
Still in one piece?

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
As far as I can tell. I figured it would've disappeared

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,120
With the rest of our stuff.

104
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:06,880
I guess whatever we had with us when we moved

105
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,080
Is along for the ride.

106
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,040
What?

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,210
Look who's back.

108
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,580
Welcome back, dr. wizard.

109
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,980
I think it's mr. wizard. shut up.

110
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,180
You've been gone for two hours. what the hell were you doing?

111
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,410
Yeah, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,380
I...  left my pack in the jungle and I was coming back

113
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,440
And i-i-i just--it was a while before I realized

114
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,580
That I was just... uh, I was really lost.

115
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,610
Well, you figure out when the sky's gonna light up again?

116
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,480
I don't know. well, you at least got a plan?

117
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,480
I think we should take the zodiac,

118
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,010
- Head to a shipping lane. - no. no, no, no.

119
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,510
We can't just sail out on any course.

120
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,980
For us to leave, I need to calculate a new bearing,

121
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,480
And, uh, to do that...

122
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
I need to determine where we are now...

123
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,540
Time.

124
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,880
And what are the rest of us supposed to do?

125
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,740
I'm gonna go find us something to eat.

126
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,780
And how are you planning on doing that?

127
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,510
Don't worry about it.

128
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,010
I guess we'll get the water.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,810
Dude, wake up!

130
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,940
Come on. I can't do this on my own!

131
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
I promise I'll pay you back.

132
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,680
Wait right here.

133
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,040
Shih tzus?

134
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,740
I like shih tzus.

135
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,340
It looks like you "heart" them.

136
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,580
Rough night?

137
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,810
Yeah.

138
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,040
Your friend's pretty wasted.

139
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,310
Yeah.

140
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,240
I know you from somewhere, don't i?

141
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,910
No. I think I do.

142
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,580
Yeah, you definitely look familiar. I just have one of those faces.

143
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,380
You're lying.

144
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,610
I don't believe in lying.

145
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,710
I remember!

146
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,110
You're the guy who won the lottery...

147
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,380
And you crashed in that plane.

148
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,110
No. I must look like him. you're him. hey! buy a ticket here.

149
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,840
If you win, we get a commission. you're good luck.

150
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,440
Sorry. wrong dude. keep the change.

151
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,280
Okay.

152
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,840
Okay, we're outta here.

153
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,780
Mommy, I wanna go home.

154
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,310
Look at your book, baby.

155
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,210
Hello?

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,010
I-i can't believe it's you.

157
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,140
No. hi.

158
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,810
How are you?

159
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,410
Wait, you're in l.a.?

160
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,340
Of course I can meet, yeah. what...

161
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,140
I know exactly where that is. I'll be there in half an hour.

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,510
Mommy, where are we going?

163
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,180
To see a friend.

164
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,280
You looking for your pills, jack?

165
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,780
I flushed them down the toilet.

166
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,940
Thank you.

167
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,510
I was just gonna do that myself.

168
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,640
Yeah, I figured you were.

169
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,580
Going somewhere?

170
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,210
I'm checking out.

171
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,980
Where are we going?

172
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,080
You're going home. and find yourself a suitcase.

173
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,540
If there's anything in this life you want,

174
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,940
ck it in there...

175
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,410
Because you're never coming back.

176
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,180
Good.

177
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,010
Good.

178
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,440
I'll pick you up in six hours.

179
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,340
And where will you be going?

180
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,980
John's casket is outside in a carpet van.

181
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,480
I need to move it somewhere safe.

182
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,980
Safe?

183
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,980
He's dead, isn't he?

184
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,640
I'll see you in six hours, jack.

185
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,710
> previously on "expos?...

186
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,840
It looks like the scorpion is taking over

187
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,910
All the cobra's business.

188
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,440
You want me to work with tsunami,

189
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,440
- The dragon lady of van nuys? - Yeah.

190
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm here to capture the scorpion,

191
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,410
So if you've got a problem with that, you can go work stage 3.

192
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
she's hit!

193
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,180
Hey, dad.

194
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,640
How's it going?

195
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,280
About new lower prices.

196
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,410
How much do you think one of these sandwiches would cost?

197
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,980
Eight bucks.

198
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,640
Would you believe it if we told you under five dollars?

199
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,340
I think that's great that quiznos is thinking about our wallets.

200
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,210
Yes!

201
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,240
Wachovia is now part of wells fargo.

202
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,340
We're now one team that's nationwide

203
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,380
And twice as strong

204
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,880
With even more capabilities,

205
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,510
More resources

206
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,480
And more solutions planned for the future.

207
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,380
So while it's business as usual today,

208
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,340
You can look forward to even more great things ahead.

209
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,580
Wachovia and wells fargo.

210
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,230
No. I just got up. why, are you wanted again?

211
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,000
Uh, yeah. kinda.

212
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,500
Is mom here? no, she's out shopping.hey, set him over

213
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
Oh, man, he's out. is he... breathing?

214
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,870
Barely. what happened?

215
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,300
He got shot by a dart. a dart? what, were you in the zoo or something?

216
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,000
No, we were at the safe house. the safe house?

217
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Sayid took me there to protect me.

218
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,700
Then these two guys jumped down, they shot him with darts,

219
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,470
And now he's--he's in a coma or something. hugo, this doesn't make sense.

220
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,570
And what are you doing out of the mental institution?

221
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,140
Sayid pulled me out. I'm in danger. we both are.

222
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,440
Danger from who?

223
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,570
I'm not sure exactly.

224
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,500
Hello?

225
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,470
Mr. and mrs. reyes?

226
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,300
L.a.p.d. can you open the gate, please

227
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,970
Just what kind of trouble are you in?

228
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,970
Dad, please! just don't tell 'em I'm here!

229
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,800
All right, but then you're gonna tell me the truth.

230
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,700
Well, give us a call if you hear anything.

231
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,370
You killed three people?

232
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,800
No. sayid did. oh. well, that's better.

233
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,270
Come on. let's get him to the couch.

234
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,240
He saved me. I think we should call a lawyer right now.

235
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,870
No, no, no. we can't go public. they're after us.

236
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Who? who is after you?

237
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,970
I don't know. sayid knows. he can explain.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Sayid ain't explaining nothing.

239
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,370
We need to get him to a hospital.

240
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,940
Did you not hear me? people are trying to kill us.

241
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,840
We go to a hospital, they'll find us!

242
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,100
Like--like "the godfather." it's the last place you go.

243
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,900
Everyone knows it. they-- they smother you with pillows

244
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,300
And make it look like an accident.

245
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,750
Sayid, please wake up!

246
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,200
That's not gonna work. We need a doctor.

247
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,550
I think I know what to do.

248
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,200
Mommy, mommy, can I push the button?

249
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,670
Sure you can, sweetie.

250
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,250
But we're all the way to the top, okay?

251
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,630
So I want you to press number 3-1. You see it?

252
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,200
You see it? Okay. You get it. 3-1.

253
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah! That's the one!

254
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,300
You pressed it! You pressed it!

255
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,490
Hi.

256
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,650
Hello, Kate.

257
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:49,150
Have a nice day.

258
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,750
I'll be right with you.

259
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,410
Hello, Ben.

260
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,340
If it's the porterhouse you're looking for, we're out.

261
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,230
No, no porterhouse.

262
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,100
I do, however, have something

263
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,150
Very important in my van, Jill,

264
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,200
And I need you to watch it for me.

265
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,870
- Is it what I think it is? - It is.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,730
He'll be safe with me.

267
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,530
- Have Gabriel and Jeffrey checked in yet? - Yeah.

268
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,100
Everything's moving right on schedule.

269
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,870
- How's it going with Shephard? - He's with us.

270
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,601
Really? What'd you do, bribe him with some pills?

271
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,200
Cut the man some slack.

272
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,670
He's been through a lot. We all have.

273
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,930
Right. Of course.

274
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,470
Sorry.

275
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,800
So keep him safe, Jill.

276
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,930
Because if you don't...

277
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,200
Everything we're about to do...

278
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,930
Won't matter at all.

279
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,030
Oh, you got it! You got it! You got it!

280
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,400
You got it. You got it. All right! Finally we got...

281
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,651
Why did you do that?

282
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:11,450
Because you're supposed to fan the flame, Rose.

283
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,100
I thought you said you knew how to start a fire.

284
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,950
And I thought you said you didn't care.

285
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:15,999
I care about surviving.

286
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:20,651
I think you need to take a time-out, Neil.

287
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,700
- You'll get it, Bernard. You will. - Yeah. All right.

288
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,130
Just--just try again.

289
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,400
Give me one second.

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,430
I got you something.

291
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,901
I found these in the jungle.

292
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,551
- Look at that. Thank you. -There was only two,

293
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:41,400
But I thought we could both do with a bite to eat.

294
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Thank you very much, very much.

295
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,700
You all right?

296
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,870
I just can't seem to shake this bloody headache.

297
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,200
Well... I'm sure it'll pass.

298
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,170
No, it's not just that.

299
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,230
It's the weirdest thing. Earlier, I was...

300
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,430
I was thinking about my mom,

301
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,700
And all of sudden, I-I couldn't remember her maiden name.

302
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,201
I mean, isn't that odd?

303
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,900
Don't worry about it.

304
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,130
Listen, all of us have been under a lot of stress. Okay?

305
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,200
Daniel
Daniel...

306
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,770
Do you know what's happening to me?

307
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,530
Dinner!

308
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,400
That's great! Wow! Where'd you get that?

309
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,630
I found it.

310
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,030
What do you mean you "found" it?

311
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,870
It died in the jungle. I found it.

312
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,470
Don't worry. It's fine. It's only been dead three hours.

313
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,190
What?

314
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,250
Who's got a knife?

315
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,380
A knife? You need a knife?

316
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,200
Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove.

317
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,300
What's your problem?

318
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,150
My problem is, we don't have a knife.

319
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,250
W-we don't have anything.

320
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,050
And it wouldn't even matter if we did,

321
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,200
'Cause Bernie the dentist can't even start a fire.

322
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Hey, ease up there, Frogurt.

323
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,350
It's Neil, you inbred.

324
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,180
And I'm not gonna ease up,

325
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,800
'Cause I'm tired and I'm hungry and I'm screwed!

326
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,650
- We're all screwed! - Calm down, Neil.

327
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,650
We're gonna get through this.

328
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,050
How are any of us gonna get through this?!

329
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,210
Didn't you hear what I just said?! We can't even get fire!

330
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,380
Run!

331
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,250
Come on! Split up! Everybody, get to the creek!

332
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,820
Dan
Ow! Dan!

333
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,720
Keep moving!

334
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Come on. He's dead.

335
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,400
Come on! You wanna be dead, too?! Come on!

336
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,230
There's nothing you coulda done. We gotta go now!

337
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,801
Dude, they're on a stakeout?

338
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,530
You just escaped from a mental institution.

339
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,145
There's dead bodies everywhere!

340
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,730
Of course they're on a stakeout!

341
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,351
They think you're crazy enough to come back home.

342
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,430
S-so are you...

343
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,830
Crazy?

344
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,330
Do you think I am?

345
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,630
Well, either that or you're lying to me.

346
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,999
I'm not crazy,

347
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:26,270
And I have a really good reason why I'm lying to you.

348
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,500
Well, what is it?

349
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,800
Why is there a dead pakistani on my couch?!

350
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
He's not dead, ma.

351
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,470
Well, he's not breathing.

352
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,540
He's not?!

353
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,670
It's okay, Carmen. We have a plan.

354
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,600
A plan? What are you talking about?

355
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,140
He is breathing... kind of. Dad, we gotta go now.

356
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,450
Hugo, what's happening?

357
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,200
Mom, please!

358
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,140
No "mom, please" me! Why are you all over the news?

359
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,635
Do you know what they are telling about you?

360
00:23:00,635 --> 00:23:02,100
Yeah, mom. I know.

361
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,755
Look, everything's gonna make sense. I promise.

362
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:05,370
It better!

363
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,300
Officers.

364
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,240
So how long are you in l.a.?

365
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,870
Just a few days.

366
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,340
I have some business to attend to.

367
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,540
But I wanted to see you.

368
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,240
Here it is.

369
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,640
Her name's ji yeon. here's a baby picture.

370
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,970
Oh! she's beautiful.

371
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,540
Thank you. she's with her grandmother in seoul.

372
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,970
I hope someday you get to meet her.

373
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,440
It would be nice to see her and aaron play together.

374
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,810
Yeah.

375
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,570
Kate? are you all right?

376
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,110
Yeah. I'm fine.

377
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,070
Are you?

378
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,040
Somebody knows we're lying.

379
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,410
What?

380
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,370
Some lawyers came to see me.

381
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,410
Who?

382
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,710
Two men. they came to my house

383
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,240
And they asked for a blood sample.

384
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,610
Some kind of lawsuit.

385
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,310
They wanted to test to see if...

386
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,340
To see if aaron's my son.

387
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,010
Who did these lawyers represent?

388
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,510
I don't know. they wouldn't tell me who their client is.

389
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,340
Then they're not interested in exposing the lie.

390
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,510
How do you know?

391
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,010
Because if they were, they would just do it.

392
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,110
They wouldn't come to you in private.

393
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,040
They don't care that we're lying. they just want aaron.

394
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,640
But who... who would do that? we--

395
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,710
I don't know, but you need to take care of them.

396
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,240
What do you mean, take care of them?

397
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,110
Wouldn't you do anything you had to

398
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,110
In order to keep aaron?

399
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,410
What kind of a person do you think I am?

400
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,510
Jin  jin
Jin! jin!

401
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:29,940
The kind of person who makes hard decisions when she has to.

402
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,610
You get the baby on the chopper. I'll get jin.

403
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,040
Like you did on the freighter.

404
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,140
You told me to get on the helicopter,

405
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,610
- And you said you'd get jin. - We gotta get outta here!

406
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,770
Sun, I hope you don't think...

407
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,410
But you did what you had to do.

408
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,410
And if you hadn't...

409
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,140
We probably all would've died instead of just my husband.

410
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm sorry.

411
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,570
I'm so sorry. i...

412
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,370
I don't blame you.

413
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,870
So...

414
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,270
How's jack?

415
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,740
Hugo said I could trust you.

416
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:36,340
I wasn't so sure. but he swore I could, so...

417
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,170
Can i?

418
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,940
Yes. of course.

419
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,940
All right.

420
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,840
What happened to him?

421
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,270
Hugo said he got hit with some dart.

422
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,440
Must've been some drugs or something.

423
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,940
- And where is hurley right now? - At our house, freaking out.

424
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,470
Let me get my car. help me move h over.

425
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,110
I'm gonna have to get him to the hospital.

426
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,970
No. no, h-hugo said that whoever did this--

427
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:06,820
They'll come back after him. all due respect, mr.

428
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,140
Reyes, but you brought him to me,

429
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,880
-So I'm gonna do what I think is best for sayid. -all right, fine.

430
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,040
Take him to the hospital.

431
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,440
But with all due respect to you, dr. shephard,

432
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,940
-When this is over, you're gonna do something for me. -what?

433
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,370
Stay away from hugo. whatever it is you talked him into,

434
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,040
Something tells me

435
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,540
You don't have his best interests at heart.

436
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,370
So stay away from my son.

437
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,810
Hello?

438
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,110
Ben
Ben...

439
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,040
You'll never guess who just showed up my door

440
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,240
Who?

441
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,510
Sayid
Sayid.

442
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,030
Who is sayid?

443
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,940
I thought he was your friend.

444
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,600
He is my friend...

445
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,570
But he's also got this double life

446
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,870
Where he does crazy ninja moves and spy stuff.

447
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,870
But he's a good guy.

448
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,240
A good guy doesn't kill three men.

449
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,070
A good guy doesn't kill any men.

450
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,570
-Mom  -Don't "mom" me.

451
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,240
You are in terrible trouble, hugo.

452
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,740
The news thinks you did this.

453
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,270
And if the news does, everyone does.

454
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,040
Why is this happening?

455
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,040
How can anybody want to hurt you?

456
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
I don't know.

457
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,300
Tell your mother the truth.

458
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:57,340
We lied, ma.

459
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,440
What do you mean you lied?

460
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,440
All of us-- the oceanic six,

461
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,140
We lied about what happened after the crash.

462
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,600
And what did happen?

463
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,740
Okay.

464
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,300
See, we did crash,

465
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,700
But it was on this crazy island.

466
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,170
And we waited for rescue, and there wasn't any rescue.

467
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,140
And there was a smoke monster,

468
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,670
And then there were other people on the island.

469
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
We called them the others, and they started attacking us.

470
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,740
And we found some hatches,

471
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,170
And there was a button you had to push every 108 minutes or...

472
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,640
Well, I was never really clear on that.

473
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,100
But... the others didn't have anything to do with the hatches.

474
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,140
That was the dharma initiative. but they were all dead.

475
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,670
The others killed them, and now they're trying to kill us.

476
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,140
And then we teamed up with the others

477
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,000
Because some worse people were coming on a freighter.

478
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,900
Desmond's girlfriend's father sent them to kill us.

479
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,640
So we stole their helicopter

480
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,700
And we flew it to their freighter, but it blew up.

481
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,900
And we couldn't go back to the island

482
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,570
Because it disappeared, so then we crashed into the ocean,

483
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,570
And we floated there for a while

484
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,700
Until a boat came and picked us up.

485
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,700
And by then, there were six of us. that part was true.

486
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,700
But the...

487
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,370
But the rest of the people...

488
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Who were on the plane?

489
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,840
They're still on that island.

490
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,400
I believe you.

491
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:03,470
I don't understand you,

492
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,470
But I believe you.

493
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,570
A lot of people died, ma.

494
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,700
And now this bad stuff is happening because...

495
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,070
We shouldn't have lied.

496
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,170
You okay?

497
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,140
Yeah, I'm fine. I just stepped on something.

498
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,040
Something jammed...

499
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,640
Son of a bitch.

500
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,640
We should keep moving.

501
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,100
We gotta hook up with everybody at the creek.

502
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,590
It's a long creek, james. which part?

503
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,040
I don't know--the wet part.

504
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,040
Sorry if my plan's not up to others' stan--

505
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,970
Who were those people? Are they yours?

506
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,600
Did they shoot the arrows?

507
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,200
You want me to crawl out there and ask 'em?

508
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,370
You don't have to be a wiseass. I'm just trying--

509
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,670
What are you doing on our island?!

510
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,340
Son of a bitch.

511
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,210
Come on, sayid.

512
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,840
Come on.

513
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,470
Sayid
Sayid.

514
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,840
It--it's... it's Jack.

515
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,440
It's okay. it's all right.

516
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,770
U're okay. you're all right.

517
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,170
What happened?

518
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,710
You're fine. you're in the hospital.

519
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,040
Hurley's father brought you to me.

520
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,840
Hurley's father?

521
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,440
Sayid, you've been attacked.

522
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,370
Where's Hurley?

523
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,310
He's at his parents' house.

524
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,870
Who's with him?

525
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,510
I don't know. his mother, maybe?

526
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,640
Does anyone else know he's there?

527
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,740
Hello, Hugo.

528
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,470
Get away from me.

529
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,810
Get away!

530
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,110
Hugo, I know you're in trouble,

531
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,140
And I can assure you I've taken care of everything.

532
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,840
I have a car waiting for us out back.

533
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,940
The police didn't see me come in.

534
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,910
I can get you out of here.

535
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,010
No way, dude.

536
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,970
Sayid warned me about you.

537
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:29,410
I'm taking you to sayid. he's with Jack.

538
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,170
That's why I'm here, Hugo. Jack called me.

539
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,370
How else would I know that they're together?

540
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,640
No.

541
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:43,110
You're--you're playing one of your mind games.

542
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,840
They would never trust you.

543
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:49,410
In their defense, I'm not an easy person to trust.

544
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,010
But they came around

545
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,540
When they realized that we all want the same thing.

546
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,570
And what's that?

547
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,270
To go back to the island.

548
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,670
Come with us, Hugo...

549
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,270
And this'll be over. You can stop hiding.

550
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,310
You can stop worrying about the stories

551
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,310
And the deceptions.

552
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,370
If you come with me,

553
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,340
You won't ever have to lie again.

554
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,640
Please.

555
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,670
Let me help you.

556
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,570
Never, dude.

557
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,770
Hey! hey, you got me!

558
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,240
That's right, you got me! that's right! I'm the killer! stop! police!

559
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,510
Face your back towards me! Slowly drop down to your knees! I'm the killer.

560
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,040
I'm crazy.

561
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm a murderer. I killed four people... three people.

562
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,170
However many are dead, I killed them. I killed them.

563
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,410
I killed them all. j-just-- just get me away from here.

564
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,970
You have the right to remain silent.

565
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,470
Anything can and will be used against you in a court of law.

566
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,170
You have the right to speak to an attorney

567
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,290
And to have one present during any questioning...

568
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,370
Just get me out of here.

569
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,270
If you can't afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you.

570
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,170
I'm gonna make this quite simple for you.

571
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:34,210
You're gonna tell me what you're doing,

572
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,690
How many of you there are and how you got here.

573
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,140
Let her go.

574
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,770
Unless you're answering my questions, Don't speak.

575
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,290
I want you to tell me everything or I'll cut off her other hand. what?!

576
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,770
What?!

577
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,170
- Other?  - the first one isn't negotiable.

578
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,440
It's just to illustrate how serious I am.

579
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,040
No! hold on! hold on! chill out! we're not supposed to be here.

580
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,270
Something's happening to the island.

581
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,510
- There are these flashes-  - do it!

582
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,170
No! wait a second! I'll tell you whatever you want to know!

583
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,770
- Do it!  - No!

584
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,740
James  Juliet
James. Juliet.

585
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,840
Nice to see ya.

586
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,340
Any luck?

587
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,840
Yes.

588
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,110
Really?

589
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,010
Really.

590
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,870
What about you?

591
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,070
I'm having some... difficulties.

592
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,070
Well, you better get busy...

593
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,840
Because you only have 70 hours.

594
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:18,210
No, no, that's not enough time. I need at least--

595
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,210
What you need is irrelevant.

596
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,670
70 hours is what you've got.

597
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,370
Look, I lost reyes tonight.

598
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,240
What happens if I can't get them all to come back?

599
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,040
Then god help us all.
