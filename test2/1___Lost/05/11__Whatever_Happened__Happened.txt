1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,930
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,380
this is your daughter.

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:05,680
Her name'slementine.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,280
Those are fake necklaces.

5
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,050
I'll take the one on the end.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,230
Why'd you help me?

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,970
Just one girl watching
another girl's back, I guess.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,810
why are you telling me this?

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,930
Just do it, freckles.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,030
I think we should say he's mine.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,980
There's other ways to do this.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,740
After everyone we've lost,
I can't lose him, too.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,130
My client insists that we...

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,730
handle the exchange of custody quietly.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,580
You are going to lose the boy.

16
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,680
that's claire's mother.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,730
Everything that kate and i
have done, it was for aaron.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,510
Who'S... aon?

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,550
I'm ben.

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,880
It's nice to meet you, ben.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,740
if I let you out...

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,300
will you take me with
you to your people?

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,240
That's why I'm here.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,050
Jin?

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,090
What are you doing here

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,970
hello, jin? Are you there?

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,510
jin? Can you hear me?

28
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,630
hello?

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,390
Jin? It's--it's phil,
man. Where have you been?

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,080
The hostile escaped. We're
searching the east grid.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,310
He's headed north.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,400
How the hell do you know that?

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,340
because he attacked me.

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,030
What? Where are you?

35
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,680
jin? ! You still there? Jin? Jin!

36
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,700
please help.

37
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,000
okay, everybody, listen up.

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,040
We don't know yet if
another attack is coming.

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,660
So everybody needs to be ready for
your security assignments, okay?

40
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,940
Make sure you're in contact
with your team leaders.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,210
Lafleur's got search parties out, but
the hostile's got a good jump on us.

42
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,580
We're pretty sure he used this fire
as a diversion in order to escape.

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,760
is he talking about sayid?

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,370
If he was locked up, how
could he start the fire?

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,930
Who are you?

46
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,760
Jack shephard. I'M... I'm new.

47
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,060
Ll, jack, the way he started
the fire is he had help, okay?

48
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,110
Somebody torched that van, and then
that somebody let him out of his cell.

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,540
And since the security cameras didn't pick
up any hostiles crossing the perimeter,

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,180
that means it was one of us.

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,580
Baxter, I want a full
report on cleanup A.S.A.P.

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,130
you got it, horace.

53
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,000
hey, you.

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,440
Yeah, you.

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,330
You're in the motor pool, right?

56
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,180
- Uh, yeah.
- Do you mind running that winch for me?

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,640
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

58
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,340
Okay, no worries. Just throw this lever.
When I tell you to stop... just pull it up.

59
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,650
- All right.
- See? Simple.

60
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,880
- Don't do it till I'm ready.
- Okay.

61
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,990
All right, crank her up.

62
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,250
so they just stuck you in the
motor pool when you got here?

63
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,740
Yeah, pretty much.

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,950
Yeah, same thing happened to me.

65
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,250
Wait, hold. Hold it there. That's
good right there. That's good.

66
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,460
I guess they couldn't sucker
anybody into getting on that sub

67
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,030
if they told us we were gonna
be grease monkeys and janitors.

68
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,590
- Well, you gotta start somewhere, right?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,490
- What's your name?
- I'm kate.

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,960
Welcome aboard, kate.
I'm roger. Roger linus.

71
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,390
It's nice to meet you, roger.

72
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,850
that's my kid.

73
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,680
That's my kid!

74
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,250
hi, handsome. Did you have a good sleep?

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,530
Yeah, that's my boy.

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,830
hi, caidY.

82
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,200
Oh, my god! I saw you on the news!

83
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,560
I told all my friends,
"i knowthat woman!"

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,530
- This is aaron.
- Hi, aaron.

85
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,020
Say hi.

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,650
You survived a plane crash.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,840
It's amazing. I never thought I'd see
you again. What are you doing here?

88
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,130
Sawyer sent me.

93
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,320
So that son of a bitch is still alive?

94
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,500
He was when I left.

95
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,300
And he asked you to come here and
give me an envelope full of money?

96
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,130
Well, he--he told me
where to find you, and...

97
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,300
said to take care of
clementine... his daughter?

98
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,090
Well, she's asleep
in her crib right now.

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,720
Want me to wake her up?

100
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,380
I, uh, shouldn't have bothered you.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,470
I could've sent it, and
I probably should have.

102
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
Why did you tell me all this?

103
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,210
Why'd you trust me?

104
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,070
Because I thought your daughter had
a right to know that her father cared.

105
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,430
Why didn't he come back
with the rest of you?

106
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:19,240
The helicopter that we were
on was running out of gas,

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,820
so he jumped so that we
could make it to the boat.

108
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
what a coward.

109
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,140
He was trying to do the right thing.

110
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,710
He was trying to get away from you.

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
I told him he had a daughter.

112
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,530
He never so much as lifted
a finger to try to call her.

113
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,910
So now I'm supposed to think he's a hero
because he told you to come here and help us?

114
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,930
Hell, I bet this money's
not even his, is it?

115
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,760
They gave us a settlement after the
crash, and I didn't need it all--

116
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,410
you don't have to explain it, kate.

117
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,910
You got the same look on your
face I did when he ditched me.

118
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,810
All I have for you is sympathy.

119
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,160
Is it his?

120
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,910
- What?
- Your son.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,600
Is it sawyer's?

122
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,600
no. No, I was...

123
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,040
pregnant before I met him.

124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,170
that's not your baby, is it?

125
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,360
Kate, you just told me that you and your
friends cooked a story for the whole world

126
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,770
about what happened on that island.

127
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,070
So you tell me the truth about that?

128
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,430
Why are you lying to me about him?

129
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,890
Because i have to.

130
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,370
what happened?

131
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,560
What the hell are you doing here?

132
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,540
That was ben. That kid
who was shot was ben.

133
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,670
Was it sayid? Did he shoot him?

134
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,970
Here's what you need to do, kate-- keep
your mouth shut and stop asking questions.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,850
'Cause putting any attention on yourself
is the last thing I need right now.

136
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,200
Now scram. I don't want you around here.

137
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,890
- I just wanna know what's going on.
- Lafleur.

138
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,450
What... what, uh...
what's she doing here?

139
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,030
- This is, uh...
- I'm kate.

140
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,030
Kate. She's new over at the motor pool.

141
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
I was seeing if she saw anything
suspicious, but she didn't, so...

142
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,660
you can run along, thanks.

143
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,310
Have you checked out
the hostile's cell yet?

144
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,000
I was a little busy trying to keep
the town fromurnin' down, horace.

145
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,420
Okay. Well, then let's do it.

146
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,240
he didn't break out.
Somebody let him out.

147
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,820
These are janitor's keys.

148
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,470
We've only got three janitors.

149
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,610
There's roger, willie
and,h, that new guy.

150
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,610
I just met him. His name's jack.

151
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,600
Yeah. I just brought him in from
the sub. I'll go talk to him.

152
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,960
Les, you wanna come with me?

153
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,810
Yeah, sure, boss.

154
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,560
All right, I want you to find jack and
hurley and kate as quick as you can.

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,040
Put 'em in a house and sit on 'em.

156
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,020
What for?

157
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,510
'Cause I don't want 'em
talking to anybody else.

158
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,250
Things are starting to
spin out of control here.

159
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,500
- All right, I got it.
- All right, go.

160
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,450
Who did this? Do you know
who did this to my son?

161
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,300
Not yet, but we're working
on it. How's he doing?

162
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,990
I don't know. Juliet
told me to wait out here.

163
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,180
Let me see if I can
get an update for ya.

164
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,120
Thanks, jim.

165
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,860
- Roger?
- Yeah?

166
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,090
You happen to have your keys with you?

167
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,520
Yeah. Why? What do you need?

168
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,050
I must've left them at... at the house.

169
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,780
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,370
more gauze.

171
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,590
- Here's some gauze.
- Yeah, right hereyeah.

172
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,080
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging, we're
just gonna have to pack the whole tract.

173
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,420
- Okay.
- Where's the doctor?

174
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,010
At the looking glass
station till friday.

175
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,030
- How is he doing?
- Not well. Hook him.

176
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,030
He's still bleeding in there
somewhere, and I can't fix it.

177
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,610
- It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

178
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,550
Someone needs to get in there who can
find the damage that bullet did and fix it.

179
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,620
he needs a real surgeon.

180
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,550
you're telling us we're
under house arrest?

181
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,230
No, you're all free to
leave whenever you want...

182
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,710
but I'll shoot you in the leg.

183
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,800
and whose idea was this?

184
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,740
Who do you think?

185
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,580
Sawyer's just doing his job, jack.

186
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,390
What the hell are you doing, tubby?

187
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,350
Checking to see if I'm disappearing.

188
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,160
- What?
- "Back to the future," man.

189
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,580
We came back in time to the
island and changed stuff.

190
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,550
So if little ben dies, he'll
never grow up to be big ben,

191
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,070
who's the one who made us come
back here in the first place.

192
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,520
Which means we can't be
here. And therefore, dude?

193
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,470
We don't exist.

194
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,760
You're an idiot.

195
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,150
- Am I?
- Yeah. It doesn't work like that.

196
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,230
You can't change anything.

197
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,560
You're maniac iraqi buddy shot linus.

198
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,180
That is what always happened.

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,110
It's just... we never
experienced how it all turns out.

200
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,640
This is really confusing.

201
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,010
Yeah, well, get used to it.

202
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,800
But the good news is that linus didn't
die, so that means the kid can't either.

203
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,120
He'll be fine.

204
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,250
Didn't look like he was gonna be fine.

205
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,180
What if you're wrong?

206
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,150
Well, if I'm wrong, then I
guess we all stop existing,

207
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,540
and none of it matters
anyway then, does it?

208
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,210
doc, I need you to come with me.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,040
Come with you where?

210
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,550
Juliet said the kid's losing blood, and
we ain't got none to put back in him.

211
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,910
So we need you to show
us where he sprung a leak.

212
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,140
No.

213
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,790
What?

214
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,990
No, I'm not coming with you.

215
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,540
If you don't come wi me,
jack, that kid's gonna die.

216
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,790
Then he dies.

217
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,310
What are you doing?

218
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,350
Making some sandwiches.

219
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,060
I figured everybody'd
be getting hungry by now.

220
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,300
he's just a boy, jack.
You can'just let him die.

221
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,100
You heard miles. We can't
change what's already happened.

222
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,290
This has nothing to do with me.

223
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,070
Unless you're the onewho's
supposed to save him.

224
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,740
30 years from now, that boy's gonna be a man
that locks me in a cage because he needs surgery.

225
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,420
And then you're gonna come in and
you're gonna beg me to operate on him

226
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,980
because he's threatening
to murder sawyer.

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
I've already done this once.

228
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,900
I've already saved benjamin
linus, and I did it for you, kate.

229
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,310
I don't need to do it again.

230
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,910
This is our fault.

231
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,710
We brought sayid back. We caused this.

232
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,760
You know, when we were here before, I
spent all of my time trying to fix things.

233
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,100
But... did you ever think that maybe the
island just wants to fix things itself?

234
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,190
And maybe I was just...
gettin' in the way?

235
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,630
You know, I don't like the new you.

236
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,630
I liked the old you, who wouldn't just
sit around and wait for things to happen.

237
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,770
you didn't like the old me, kate.

238
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,570
Where are you going?

239
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,620
just relax. You're okay.

240
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,630
I'm sorry. Juliet?

241
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,490
One of the new people is here.

242
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,460
She heard ben needed blood,
says she's a universal donor.

243
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,500
This might hurt for a second.

244
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,970
Good. very brave.

245
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,050
So james told me that jack wouldn't
help, but he didn't say why.

246
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,550
If i understood why jack does what he does,
I sure as hell wouldn't be sitting here.

247
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,590
Off island, did something
happen with you two?

248
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,200
we were engaged. Does that count?

249
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
What's going on?

250
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,550
Roger, I asked you to wait outside.

251
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,950
No, what's going on with my kid?

252
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,550
Kate is giving us some fresh
blood so we can transfuse ben.

253
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,250
Well, I'm not waitin' outside.

254
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,720
You know, he could stay with
me, and you could check on ben,

255
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,570
and--and roger here could keep me
company, make sure I don't pass out.

256
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,230
Okay. Roger, have a seat.

257
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,720
- Thanks.
- Sure.

258
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,040
- He stole my keys.
- Sorry?

259
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,830
Lafleur asked me where my keys were.

260
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,870
That bastard doesn't ask any questions
he doesn't know the answers to...

261
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,070
which means my son stole my keys so
he could bust that animal out of jail.

262
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,970
Why--why would
he do that?

263
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,490
Because of me.

264
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,210
You got kids?

265
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,940
No.

266
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,710
I thought I was gonna be the
greatest father ever. You know?

267
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,860
I guess it didn't work out that way.

268
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,800
What about his mother?
Is she still around?

269
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,440
No, she's dead.

270
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,270
She died the day he was born.

271
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,100
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,320
yeah, me, too.

273
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,290
I tried to do what I thought
she'd want me to do, but...

274
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,970
I guess a boy just needs his mother.

275
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,840
- what's going on?
- He's going into hypoxic shock.

276
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,760
- What does that mean? What's the matter with him?
- He needs more oxygen.

277
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,430
- Roger, get out of here!
- What?

278
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,960
- Get him out of here!
- Wait!What--what is--

279
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,630
- Please, roger, just wait outside.
- wait a minute.

280
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,340
let me get this straight.

281
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,970
- All this already happened.
- Yes.

282
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,910
So this conversation
we're having right now...

283
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,540
- we already had it.
- Yes!

284
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,010
Then what am I gonna say next?

285
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,540
I don't know.

286
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,540
Then your theory is wrong!

287
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:11,260
For the thousandth time, you dingbat,
the conversation already happened,

288
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,690
but not for you and me.

289
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,190
For you and me, it's
happening right now.

290
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,330
Okay, answer me this.

291
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,700
If all this already
happened to me, then...

292
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,700
why don't i remember any of it?

293
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,640
Because once ben turned that wheel,

294
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,500
time isn't a straight
line for us anymore.

295
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,930
Our experiences in the
past and the future occurred

296
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,750
before these experiences right now.

297
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,290
Say that again.

298
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,730
Shoot me. Please. Plea?

299
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,440
I can't shoot you.

300
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,860
Because if you die in 1977, then you'll never come
back to thesland on the freighter 30 years from now.

301
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:04,050
I can die because I've already
come to the island on the freighter.

302
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,810
Any of us can die because
this is ourpresenT.

303
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,470
But you said ben couldn't die because he still
has to grow up and become the leader of the others.

304
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,990
Because this is his past.

305
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,500
But when we first captured ben,
and sayid, like, tortured him,

306
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,850
then why wouldn't he remember getting
shot by that same guy when he was a kid?

307
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,440
I hadn't thought of that.

308
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,550
How is he?

309
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,410
He's stable.

310
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,390
Is he gonna be okay?

311
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,320
He's got some fresh blood running through him,which is a good thing.

312
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,330
Roger,I need you to go out to the medical station.

313
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,090
There are some supplies there that we don't have here.

314
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,750
Hey,I just wanna say,I-I...

315
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,560
I wanna say thanks.

316
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,310
I know that you're doing everything you can...

317
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,430
to save him,and...

318
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,890
all right,I'm--I'm gonna go,okay?

319
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,000
Is he any better?

320
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,010
He is stable now.

321
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,350
But I can't,um...

322
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,690
I can't fix it.

323
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,740
What about the sub?

324
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,970
I mean,can we takhim somewhere?

325
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,830
No.It's gone.

326
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,340
It won't be back for a couple of months.

327
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,940
But he can't die,right?

328
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,700
He is going to die.

329
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,090
He iin a medical situation that is not resolvable.

330
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,850
Okay,well,we can't just sit here and do nothing.

331
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,750
I mean,there's got to be someone who can help him.

332
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,030
We have entire...

333
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,370
what?

334
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,500
Maybe there's something they can do.

335
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,390
"They"?

336
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,290
The others.

337
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,360
you got him?

338
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,790
Yeah.Ready?

339
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,910
One,two,three,go.

340
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,540
okay,let's go.

341
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm coming wityou.

342
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,160
No,no,no,no.

343
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,370
If something goes wrong or we get caught,it doesn't matter for me,

344
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,110
but you've got a whole life here.

345
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,700
And besides,if sawyer knew that I got you involved in this,he'd kill me.

346
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,010
How are you gonna manage?

347
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,750
I'll manag don't worry.

348
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:58,040
kate,sawyer's gonna find out ben's gone,and when he does,

349
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,240
I have to tell him what happened.

350
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,420
But I'll give you as much of a head start as I can.

351
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,950
Good luck.

352
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,060
there's someone...

353
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,250
someone here in los angeles.

354
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,450
Let me take you to them.

355
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,230
Who?

356
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,800
The same person that's gonna show us how to get back the island.

357
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:30,290
Is that what this is about?

358
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,690
You knew about this.

359
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,140
-No,I was o--
-and that is why you were pretending to care about aaron,

360
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,350
to convince me to go back there?

361
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,600
I wasn't pretending anything.

362
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,300
This is insane.You guys are crazy.

363
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,750
-Kate--
-jack,don't!

364
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,890
Mommy,I'm thirsty.

365
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,120
I need some milk.

366
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,400
Do you want chocolate milk oregular milk?

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,090
Juice box.

368
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,570
You don't want milk anymore?

369
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,400
Juice box.

370
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,990
excuse me.

371
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,990
Where are you juice boxes?

372
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,790
Aisle 5.

373
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,870
Thank you very much.

374
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,110
aaron?

375
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,450
Um,excuse me.Have you seen my son?

376
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,610
-I'm sorry?
-A little 3-year-old blond?

377
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,100
Aaron?

378
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,000
Aaron?

379
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,850
Aaron?

380
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,070
Aaron!

381
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,950
Excuse me.I've lost my son.

382
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,070
He's 3.He's a little blond boy.

383
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,590
Don't worry,ma'am.I'll make an announcement.

384
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,810
No,no,no.You have to seal off the store.You...

385
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,730
aaron?

386
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,600
Hey,is this your mommy?Honey,is this your mommy?

387
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,330
I found him in the fruit section.

388
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:25,760
I--he looked lost.I was getting ready to make an announcement.

389
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,880
Thank you.Thank you very much.

390
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,570
it's okay,honey.Mommy's got you.

391
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,610
Mommy's got you.

392
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,210

393
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,980
tell my...

394
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,640
try not to talk,okay?

395
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,430
Tell my dad I'm sorry I stole his keys.

396
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,210
I know you gotta stop me...

397
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,140
but I can't just let that kid die.

398
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,710
damn it,freckles.I ain't here to stop you.

399
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,680
I'm here to help you.

400
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,990
hi,auntie kate!

401
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,340
Hi,clementine.

402
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,380
Is your mommy home?

403
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,550
Sure.I'll go get her.

404
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,830
they're going back?

405
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,440
To the island?

406
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,410
Why in god's name would they wanna do that?

407
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,020
I don't know.

408
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,770
Jack says that we weren't supposed to leave.

409
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,920
Well,jack sounds like a piece of work.

410
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,930
You look exhausted.Drink this.

411
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,540
Curl up on my bed.Take a nap.I'll watch your fella.

412
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,200
I lost him.

413
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,570
What?

414
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,630
I don't know what happened.

415
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:48,280
We were in the supermarket,and I turned around for one second,

416
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,780
d he was gone.

417
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,380
And,you know,the crazy thing is,is that...

418
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,250
as scared as I was...

419
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,940
I wasn't surprised.

420
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,590
All I could think was,it's about time.

421
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,570
Why would I feel that way?

422
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,480
I mean,why would I expect him to be taken?

423
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,380
Because you took him,kate.

424
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,950
No,I...

425
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,730
claire was gone.

426
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,490
I mean,she left him.

427
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,210
I had to take him.He needed me.

428
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,960
You needed him.

429
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,350
Sawyer broke your heart.

430
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,310
How else were you supposed to fix it?

431
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,310
figure out how you were gonna carry him out there by yourself?

432
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,910
Well,the line's just right over there,right?

433
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,210
The others are on the other side.

434
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,550
Well,they ain't right onthe her side.

435
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,610
We better get movin'.

436
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,100
Why are you doing this?

437
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,570
Why are you helping me?

438
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,400
when I found out ben was gone,and juliet told me what you were up to,

439
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,810
I asked that exact damn question...

440
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,680
why are you helping ben?

441
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,570
and she said...

442
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:39,290
no matter what he's gonna grow up to be,it's wrong to let a kid die.

443
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,410
So...

444
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,210
that's why I'm doing this.

445
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,660
I'm doing it for her.

446
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,890
Where's jack?

447
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,560
Uhhe--he's in the shower.I think.

448
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,580
Is he in trouble?

449
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,460
I just need to talk to him.

450
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,960
You two mind giving us some privacy?

451
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,920
hey,ask me more questions about time travel.

452
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,630
I needed you.

453
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,700
I'm sorry?

454
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,390
That kid was bleeding out.

455
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,920
You're a surgeon,and I needed you.

456
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,200
-That kid is be
-that's not ben yet.

457
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
He's just a kid.

458
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,210
juliet,I'm sorry.

459
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,280
I can't help you.

460
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,070
I'm not asking for your help,jack.

461
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,570
You made it pretty clear you weren't interested.

462
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,720
It's up to sawyer and kate now.

463
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,540
What?

464
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,210
She's trying to save him,and I sent james after her to help

465
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,560
because they actually care.

466
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,490
I came back here because I care,juliet.

467
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,190
I came back here because I was trying to save you.

468
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,590
We didn't need saving!

469
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,990
We've been fine for three years.

470
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,270
You came back here for you.

471
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,240
At least do me the courtesy of telling me why.

472
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,120
I came back...

473
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,200
because I was supposed to.

474
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,260
Supposed to do what?

475
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,360
I don't know yet.

476
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,370
Well,you'd better figure it out.

477
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,140
you know,I can take him for a while.

478
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,200
sure you can.

479
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,610
You know,his father said that you think ben broke sayid out.

480
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:13,150
kid'll do almost anything if he's pissed off enough at his folks.

481
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,790
Is that why you asked me to take care of your daughter?

482
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,370
Did you?

483
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,460
Of course I did.

484
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,420
go ahead and tip his ad back.

485
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,530
What's she like?

486
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,610
clementine?

487
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,500
Yeah.

488
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,940
Clementine.

489
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,200
Oh,she's beautiful.

490
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,230
Looks just like you wh she smiles.

491
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,330
She's growing up fast.

492
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,500
Already has a little attitude.

493
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,700
I bet you and cassidy had a lot to talk about.

494
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,680
She had an interesting theory on why you jumped off the chopper.

495
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,990
Yeah?What's that?

496
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,040
She thought you were worried about what would happen if you didn'T.

497
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,440
you d me would've never worked out,kate.

498
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,240
I wasn't any more fit to be your boyfriend than I am to be that little girl's father.

499
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,070
You seem to be doing all right with juliet.

500
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,940
yeah.

501
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,890
I've done a lot of growing up the past three years.

502
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,530
hands up!

503
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,230
do not move.

504
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,800
I said don't move.

505
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,820
This is a violation of the truce.

506
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,850
-You're over the line.
-We know.

507
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,340
This kid's been shot.

508
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,480
That's both of our problems.

509
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,730
So unless you want to go to war,you're gonna take us to richard alpert,

510
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,320
and you're gonna do it now.

511
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,080
mrs.Littleton,um,m kate austen.

512
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,800
I know who you are.

513
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,230
Come in.

514
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,130
thank you.

515
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,860
Your friend dr.Shephard came here last night,

516
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,520
going on and on about some person named aaron.

517
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,760
When I asked him who that was,he ran out of here like the room was on fire.

518
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:47,370
He's your grandson.

519
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:53,330
And your daughter claire...

520
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,180
is alive.

521
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,650
What are you talking about?

522
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,360
Claire died in the plane crash.

523
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,580
No,she survived.

524
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,910
When we crashed,your daughter was eight months pregnant,and...

525
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:12,190
she's the one who gave birth on the island,not me.

526
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,890
We lied.

527
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,110
There were other survivors,too.We just left them behind.

528
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,060
Why?

529
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,310
Why would you leave her there?

530
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,070
Because she disappeared,and she left the baby behind.

531
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,660
We looked everywhere,but...

532
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,850
th's when I started taking care of aaron.

533
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,950
And when we were rescued,we didn't-- we had to decide what to do with him.

534
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,310
And I knew that she had wanted him to be adopted,but I couldn'T.

535
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,870
I had to protect him,so I said he was mine.

536
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,290
Why did you lie?

537
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,520
Why didn't you come to me in the first place?

538
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,360
Because I needed him.

539
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,110
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:21,130
you're gonna see that he's so sweet and kind and good.

541
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,210
Where is he?

542
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,630
Um,I checked in two doors down.

543
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,720
He's asleep.

544
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,420
I know that this is a lot for you to handle.

545
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,130
But...

546
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,840
When you're ready,he's waiting for you.

547
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:48,800
I told him that you're his grandmother,

548
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,620
that you'll take care of him while I'm gone and that I'll be back soon.

549
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,080
Where are you going?

550
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,220
I'm going back to find your daughter.

551
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,050
bye-bye,baby.

552
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,310
Don't worry.We got 'emright where we want 'em.

553
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,040
Shut up and keep movin'.

554
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,860
What's it look like I'm doing?

555
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,540
Hello there,james.

556
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,150
Where the hell did you come from?

557
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,800
You asked my people to bring you to me.

558
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,000
Here I am.

559
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,590
Is that benjamin linus?

560
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,500
You two know each other?

561
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,330
What happened to him?

562
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,470
He was shoT.

563
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,400
And who might you be?

564
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,470
She's with me.

565
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,850
And why are you here?

566
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,490
'Cause we need you to save his life.

567
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,220
Can you?

568
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,450
If I take him,he's not ever gonna be the same again.

569
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,020
What do you mean by that?

570
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,360
What I mean is that...

571
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,180
he'll forget this ever happened,and that...

572
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,560
his innocence will be gone.

573
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:43,070
He will always be one of us.

574
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,550
You still want me to take him?

575
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,320
Yes.

576
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,570
richard...

577
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:03,510
you shouldn't do this without asking ellie.

578
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,610
-And if charles finds out--
-let him find out.

579
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,930
I don't answer to either of them.

580
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:11,010
Wh-where are you taking him?

581
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,530
come on.

582
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,390
hello,ben.

583
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,350
Welcome back to the land of the living.
