1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,983
Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:02,741
I'm here to tell you

3
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:03,533
That the island won't

4
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,934
Let you come alone.

5
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:07,367
All of you have to go back.

6
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:09,367
Is that what this is about?

7
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,367
This is insane. You guys are crazy.

8
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,200
- Kate - Jack, don't!

9
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,167
- Sayid, where are you going? - I don't want any part of this.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,501
It's Jin!

11
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:27,367
- How do you know he's alive?! - There's someone...

12
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:29,334
Someone here in Los Angeles.

13
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,667
Someone? who?

14
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,967
The same person that's gonna show us

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,067
How to get back to the island.

16
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,501
Help!

17
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:23,967
Anyone!

18
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,267
Help!

19
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,933
Help, jack!

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,768
Help! anyone!

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,267
Help!

22
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,401
Help!

23
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,301
Help!

24
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,234
Help!

25
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:22,034
It's okay. You're okay. Relax. Aah! Oh, god!

26
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:24,668
Oh, god!

27
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,501
Okay.

28
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:28,000
- Oh, my god! - We can stand.

29
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:29,867
- What? - We can stand.

30
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,100
Oh, my god.

31
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,067
It really happened.

32
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:48,401
Kate.

33
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:04,933
Kate.

34
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:08,734
Kate, can you hear me?

35
00:03:14,534 --> 00:03:16,134
Jack?

36
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,634
Are you okay?

37
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,734
Are we...

38
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,301
Yeah.

39
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:24,800
We're back.

40
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:29,567
What happened?

41
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:39,567
46 Hours Earlier

42
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:56,067
I thought I said all of them.

43
00:03:58,034 --> 00:04:01,167
This is all I could get on short notice.

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,867
Guess it'll have to do for now.

45
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:10,601
All right. Let's get started.

46
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,067
Shall we?

47
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,167
What is this place?

48
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,800
The dharma initiative called it the lamp post.

49
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,301
This is how they found the island.

50
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,533
Did you know about this place?

51
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,434
No.

52
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,100
No, I didn't.

53
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,134
Is he telling the truth?

54
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:14,367
Probably not.

55
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,767
Here we go.

56
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,767
All right.

57
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,300
I apologize if this is confusing, but...

58
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,633
Let's pay attention, yes?

59
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,633
The room we're standing in was constructed years ago

60
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,833
Over a unique pocket of electromagnetic energy.

61
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:46,300
That energy connects to similar pockets all over the world.

62
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:48,300
The people who built this room, however,

63
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,501
- Were only interested in one. - The island.

64
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,300
Yes. the island.

65
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:56,300
They'd gathered proof that it existed.

66
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,334
They knew it was out there somewhere,

67
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,334
But they just couldn't find it.

68
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:07,533
Then a very clever fellow built this pendulum

69
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:11,434
On the theoretical notion that they should stop looking

70
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:14,401
For where the island was supposed to be

71
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,833
And start looking for where it was going to be.

72
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:24,267
What do you mean, "where it was going to be"?

73
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,927
Well, this fellow presumed, and correctly,

74
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:27,867
as it turned out,

75
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,267
That the island was always moving.

76
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,566
Why do you think you were never rescued?

77
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,967
Now while the movements of the island seem random,

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,146
This man and his team

79
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,633
created a series of equations

80
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,700
Which tell us,

81
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,700
With a high degree of probability,

82
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:53,434
Where it is going to be at a certain point...

83
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,733
In time.

84
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,501
Windows, as it were,

85
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,067
That while open, provide a route back.

86
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,500
Unfortunately,

87
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,900
These windows don't stay open for very long.

88
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:14,000
Yours closes...

89
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,733
In 36 hours.

90
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,334
Um, I'm sorry. excuse me.

91
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,566
Am I really hearing this?

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,367
That's what this is about?

93
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,767
You're all going back to the island willingly?

94
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,967
Yes. why are you here, desmond?

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,767
I came here to deliver a message.

96
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,300
Daniel Faraday...

97
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,533
Your son--

98
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,267
Sent me here.

99
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,267
He wanted me to tell you

100
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,666
That he and all the people on the island need your help.

101
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,800
He said that only you could help them.

102
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,300
He didn't say Jack. He didn't say Sun. He didn't say Ben.

103
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:59,467
- He said you. - But I am helping, dear.

104
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,367
Consider the message delivered.

105
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,767
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, desmond,

106
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,733
But the island isn't done with you yet.

107
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,067
This woman cost me four years of my life--

108
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,000
Four years that I'll never get back because you told me

109
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,833
That I was supposed to go to the island!

110
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:21,367
That it was my bloody purpose!

111
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:28,700
You listen to me, brother, and you listen carefully.

112
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:33,067
These people-- they're just usin' us.

113
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
They're playing some kind of game,

114
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:37,067
And we are just the pieces.

115
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,967
Whatever she tells you to do...

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,367
Ignore it.

117
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,900
You say the island's not done with me?

118
00:09:49,933 --> 00:09:53,034
Well, I'm done with the island.

119
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
Jack...

120
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:08,267
The binder in your hands

121
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,900
Shows all the air routes that fly over the coordinates

122
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,367
Where I believe the island will be

123
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:17,000
In little more than a day from now.

124
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:21,334
There's a commercial airliner flying from l.a. to Guam.

125
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:26,434
It's going to go right through your window.

126
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:30,267
Ajira Airways, flight 3-1-6.

127
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,600
Is you have any hope of the island bringing you back,

128
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,833
It must be that plane.

129
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:39,533
You all need to be on it.

130
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,167
It must be that flight.

131
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,434
If you...

132
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,034
Want to return,

133
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:56,200
You need to recreate as best you can

134
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:57,666
The circumstances

135
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,200
That brought you there in the first place

136
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,401
That means as many of the same people

137
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:08,767
As you are able to bring with you.

138
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,134
And what if we can't get anyone else to come with us?

139
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,000
What if we're it?

140
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:18,434
All I can tell you is the result would be...

141
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,767
Unpredictable.

142
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,600
So that's it?

143
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,600
We just get on that flight,

144
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,100
And we just hope that it works?

145
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,100
That's all?

146
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:32,234
No, that's not all, jack...

147
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,167
At least, not for you.

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,768
Come on in.

149
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,000
Ben and sun--

150
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:49,999
Heard what they needed to hear,

151
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,868
And this does not concern them.

152
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,933
Oh. here we are.

153
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,100
What's this?

154
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:12,100
It's john locke's suicide note.

155
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,334
Uh... I, uh...

156
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:20,967
I didn't know.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,967
Well, why would you?

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,251
Obituaries don't see fit

159
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:28,052
To mention when people hang themselves, jack.

160
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,284
Why would he kill himself?

161
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,284
There are many reasons, I'm sure,

162
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,851
But the only one that matters is this--

163
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:48,484
He is going to help you get back.

164
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:51,985
John is going to be a proxy.

165
00:12:53,551 --> 00:12:54,851
A substitute.

166
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:56,551
A substitute for who?

167
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,785
Jack...

168
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:01,518
Who do you think?

169
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:05,251
You need to, as best you can,

170
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,251
Recreate the conditions of the original flight...

171
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:10,967
Which is why you need to

172
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,651
Give john something of your father's.

173
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:19,052
You have to get something that belonged to your father,

174
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,451
And you need to give it to john.

175
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,451
What?

176
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:26,418
That's what you have to do.

177
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,751
My father...

178
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:33,085
Is gone.

179
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:35,551
My father has been dead for three years.

180
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,518
You want me to...

181
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,518
A-and to give it to locke?! he's in a coffin!

182
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,118
This is ridiculous.

183
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,651
Oh, stop thinking how ridiculous it is

184
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:51,152
And start asking yourself

185
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:55,052
Whether or not you believe it's going to work.

186
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:01,618
That's why it's called a leap of faith, jack.

187
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:28,985
Where's sun?

188
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:31,651
She left.

189
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,317
And locke?

190
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:36,284
I mean... his body? the coffin?

191
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:38,951
I have a friend looking after it.

192
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:43,818
I'll pick it up on my way to the airport.

193
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:53,351
- What did she say to you, jack? - nothing that matters.

194
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,418
Who is she?

195
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:57,500
Why is she... helping us?

196
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,851
How does she know all this?

197
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,451
Thomas the apostle

198
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:10,685
When jesus wanted to return to judea,

199
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,851
Knowing that he would probably be murdered there,

200
00:15:13,885 --> 00:15:16,152
Thomas said to the others,

201
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:19,384
"let us also go, that we might die with him."

202
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:24,351
But thomas was not remembered for this bravery.

203
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:27,551
His claim to fame came later...

204
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,918
When he refused to acknowledge the resurrection.

205
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:34,184
He just couldn't wrap his mind around it.

206
00:15:34,217 --> 00:15:37,584
The story goes...

207
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:40,251
That he needed to touch jesus' wounds

208
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:43,418
To be convinced.

209
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,418
So was he?

210
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,118
Of course he was.

211
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:53,685
We're all convinced sooner or later, jack.

212
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,918
Where are you going?

213
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:08,885
Oh, I made a promise to an old friend of mine--

214
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:11,351
Just a loose end that needs tying up.

215
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,718
See you at the airport, jack.

216
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:57,018
Hello?

217
00:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,551
Yeah, this is him.

218
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:02,818
He did what?

219
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:04,785
This is the fourth time he's left.

220
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:06,200
He's gotta follow the rules,

221
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,652
Or he'll have to move to our fully assisted facility.

222
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,152
Yeah, I understand.

223
00:17:10,184 --> 00:17:13,251
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:17:13,284 --> 00:17:17,251
Here is my fraidy-cat rabbit!

225
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,985
Hey, ray.

226
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:24,368
- Hey, jack. - As for my next trick,

227
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:25,718
I need someone to pick a card.

228
00:17:25,751 --> 00:17:28,551
- Wanna get out of here? - The sooner the better.

229
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:33,052
Would you please pick one? look at it. mm-hmm.

230
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:38,951
You wanna tell me why you took off this time, ray?

231
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:42,052
Do I really need to answer that?

232
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:45,052
Will you at least tell me where the bus was headed?

233
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:45,350
Doesn't matter.

234
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:48,418
Anywhere I go is somewhere better than here.

235
00:17:59,284 --> 00:18:01,718
- You packed a bag? - of course I did.

236
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:08,217
One of these times, I'm actually gonna get away.

237
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,842
They won't ever find me either.

238
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:12,918
Take off again, they're gonna throw you outta here, ray.

239
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:15,685
But what would I do without my magic shows?

240
00:18:19,052 --> 00:18:23,284
Let me help you unpack, granddad.

241
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:25,584
So how are you, kiddo?

242
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,184
You seeing anyone special?

243
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:28,818
Whatever happened

244
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,751
To the girl that you brought by with you that time?

245
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,718
The pretty one with all the freckles?

246
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,918
What was her name?

247
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:37,785
Kate.

248
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:39,451
We're not together anymore.

249
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,484
Well, look at the bright side--

250
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,284
More time to come visit me.

251
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:51,184
I'd love to, granddad. I really would, but...

252
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,152
I think I might be...

253
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,951
Might be going away for a while.

254
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:58,384
Where's "away" exactly?

255
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,851
Somewhere better than here.

256
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,351
Are these yours, granddad?

257
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,284
No.

258
00:19:16,317 --> 00:19:18,384
Those were your father's.

259
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:27,651
Your mom sent me a box of his stuff after he died.

260
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:32,200
Must've got mixed in when I packed for a quick getaway.

261
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:41,167
These shoes...

262
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,868
Can I take them?

263
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,134
Be my guest.

264
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,200
Kate?

265
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,567
What are you doing here?

266
00:21:15,601 --> 00:21:18,033
Are you still going back to the island?

267
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,701
Yeah.

268
00:21:20,734 --> 00:21:22,734
Yeah, I think I am.

269
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:29,601
Then I'm going with you.

270
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:31,967
Kate...

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,933
What happened? where's aaron? where-- no, don't ask questions.

272
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:43,401
If you want me to go with you...

273
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,300
You'll never ask me that question again.

274
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:48,801
You will never ask me about aaron.

275
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,834
Do you understand, jack?

276
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:53,434
Yes.

277
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,900
Thank you.

278
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,933
Morning.

279
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,567
Morning.

280
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:31,067
Uh, I made you some coffee, and there's orange juice.

281
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,367
You still like milk and two sugars?

282
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah, sure.

283
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:54,200
Those don't make much sense for the island.

284
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,800
You might want to consider hiking boots.

285
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,334
Those were my father's.

286
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:06,267
When I went to pick up his body in sydney,

287
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,234
My dad didn't have any nice shoes.

288
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,200
My mother wanted to have the funeral

289
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,200
Soon as I landed back in l.a.

290
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,100
But I thought, who the hell's gonna see his feet?

291
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:18,033
And so i-i had these old white tennis shoes,

292
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:21,833
And I just said, "use these. put these on him."

293
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:26,666
'cause he wasn't worth a nice pair of shoes to me.

294
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,334
Or the time it would take to go out and get 'em.

295
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,633
So why don't you get rid of 'em?

296
00:23:34,334 --> 00:23:37,267
Why hold on to something that makes you feel sad?

297
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:47,933
Go ahead.

298
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:49,400
I...

299
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,167
I'll see you at the airport, okay?

300
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:03,134
-Hello? -hello, jack. are you there?

301
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah. yeah, what's u is everything all right?

302
00:24:06,134 --> 00:24:09,267
Listen, we don't have much time. I've been, uh... sidetracked,

303
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,833
And I need you

304
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,900
To pick up locke's body and take it to the airport.

305
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:17,367
The coffin is at simon's butcher shop,

306
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,733
Corner of grand and hayes.

307
00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:21,700
Why? wh-what's happened to you?

308
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,700
Just do it. please.

309
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,933
Are you jill? ben sent me.

310
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:51,200
I know who you are, dr. shephard. come on in.

311
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,867
What's in the bag?

312
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,033
Sorry.

313
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:06,200
Ben said to give you the van.

314
00:25:06,234 --> 00:25:09,300
I gotta pull it around back. give me about five minutes.

315
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,833
Wherever you are, john...

316
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:26,700
You must be laughing your ass off

317
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,000
That I'm actually doing this.

318
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,167
Because this...

319
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,400
This is even crazier than you are.

320
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:47,800
And here.

321
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,267
You can have that back.

322
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,501
I've already heard everything you had to say, john.

323
00:26:53,534 --> 00:26:56,534
You wanted me to go back. I'm going back.

324
00:27:09,766 --> 00:27:12,000
Rest in peace.

325
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,966
Mr. shephard, if you'll just bear with me.

326
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,699
The reason for transporting mr. bentham to guam?

327
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,666
Uh, it was his-- these were his wishes.

328
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:24,267
He wanted to be buried there.

329
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,933
Who will be the recipient of the deceased upon arrival?

330
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,465
Is there a funeral home or--

331
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:29,499
no, it's me. me. I'll be escorting the body.

332
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:31,966
And your relation to the deceased?

333
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,933
He was, uh, a friend.

334
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,733
Now, mr. shephard, I have to inform you that

335
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:38,900
Due to the increased security measures, we are required

336
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,799
To open the casket and perform a screening.

337
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,267
I assure you it's all done with care.

338
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,532
Do you understand, mr. shephard?

339
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:48,000
Mr. shephard?

340
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,033
Yes. yes, I understand.

341
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,466
Then please sign here.

342
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,100
Thank you for flying ajira air.

343
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:01,466
My condolences.

344
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:06,267
I'm sorry you lost your friend.

345
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,966
Thank you.

346
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,267
Please remove all jackets, sweaters,

347
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,933
Jewelry and footwear.

348
00:28:15,966 --> 00:28:17,432
Remove all laptops

349
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,432
And electronic devices from their cases

350
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,900
And place them...

351
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,166
Jack.

352
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:26,532
Sun. hey.

353
00:28:26,566 --> 00:28:29,133
You're surprised to see me?

354
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,599
I just...

355
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,033
I thought maybe you might change your mind.

356
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:35,566
If there's even a chance that jin is alive,

357
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,133
I have to be on that plane.

358
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:41,267
All passengers, please have your tickets and identification

359
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,033
Available for security.

360
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:45,233
Please remove all jackets, sweaters...

361
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,100
...all laptops and electronic devices

362
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,566
From their cases and place them in a bin.

363
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:02,499
This is the preliminary boarding announcement

364
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,367
For ajira airways flight 3-1-6,

365
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,866
With service to honolulu and guam,

366
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,333
Departing from gate 15.

367
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,866
For those of you on the standby list,

368
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,799
We'll have plenty of seats available.

369
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,233
We would like to invite our pre-board, first class

370
00:29:14,267 --> 00:29:17,466
And skyclub passengers to board the aircraft at this time.

371
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,499
What do you mean "standby"? there's no standbys.

372
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:20,799
oh, no, sir.You don't need to worry. there are...

373
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:23,599
78 seats open.

374
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,033
No. I bought those seats, all 78 of 'em.

375
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,066
I'm hugo reyes. they're not open. they're mine.

376
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,166
Check and see.

377
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,466
Yes, I see that.

378
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,333
Sir, these people just want to get to their destination.

379
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:41,100
Why would you not want them to be able to travel?

380
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:44,731
You know, it doesn't matter why.

381
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:47,267
they can take the next plane.

382
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,133
Hurley.

383
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,900
What are you doing here? how did you know about the...

384
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,833
All that matters is that I'm here, right?

385
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,200
I'm glad that you're here, man.

386
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay, then.

387
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,000
Let's do this.

388
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,599
After you.

389
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,200
Welcome to Ajira Air.

390
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:34,267
Thank you, sir. Row 8, on your left.

391
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,733
Welcome aboard.

392
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:40,599
Yes, ma'am. You may. Thank you.

393
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes, make sure you put your...

394
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,833
I will.

395
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,333
Absolutely.

396
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,432
You made it.

397
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,666
Yeah.

398
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,333
I made it.

399
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:23,399
- That should be everybody. - Hold up! Wait, please!

400
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:26,633
Thank you for not closing it.

401
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:30,033
- Oh, that's okay. go right on in. - Thanks.

402
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:37,799
Wait! What's he doing here?!

403
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,432
- Hurley, hey-- - No, no! He can't come!

404
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,333
If you want to get back, this is how it's gonna have to be.

405
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,899
No one told me he was gonna be here.

406
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,432
Who told you to be here, Hugo?

407
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:50,466
Is everything okay?

408
00:31:50,499 --> 00:31:53,100
Yes. Yes, everything's fine.

409
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,566
- Right? - Yes, Jack. I'll be fine.

410
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:59,033
Are you Jack Shephard, seat 8c?

411
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,033
Yes.

412
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:03,000
Security found this while screening your cargo.

413
00:32:04,866 --> 00:32:07,300
Now if y two don't mind taking your seats,

414
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:09,699
We are gonna be pushing back for takeoff.

415
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:14,633
What's that, jack?

416
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Nothing.

417
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,300
And the other people on this plane--

418
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,267
What's gonna happen to them?

419
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,499
Who cares?

420
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:46,300
It's pretty crazy, huh?

421
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:49,267
Which part?

422
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,466
Hurley, sayid...

423
00:33:51,499 --> 00:33:52,799
Being...

424
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:55,733
On the same plane.

425
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,000
How did they end up here?

426
00:33:58,033 --> 00:33:59,699
They bought a ticket.

427
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,733
You don't think that it means something?

428
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:06,566
That somehow...

429
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,432
We're all back together?

430
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:11,333
We're on the same plane, jack.

431
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,766
Doesn't make us together.

432
00:34:13,799 --> 00:34:16,633
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,833
And welcome to Ajira air.

434
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:22,532
This is your captain, frank j. lapidus,

435
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:24,733
And on behalf of the entire flight crew, welcome aboard.

436
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:26,599
Currently we're right on schedule,

437
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,833
Flying at a very comfortable 30,000 feet.

438
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:31,466
So sit back, relax and enjoy the in-flight movie.

439
00:34:31,499 --> 00:34:33,666
- Excuse me, ma'am? - Mr. shephard, can I help you?

440
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,666
Um, I need to talk to the pilot.

441
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,833
Frank lapidus and I are old friends, and if you could

442
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:40,832
Just tell him I'm onboard, I'd really appreciate it.

443
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:42,566
All right, but you just have to go sit down

444
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,932
Because you can't be near the cockpit door

445
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:45,265
When it's open. sure.

446
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:45,900
I understand.

447
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,733
Captain, I have a passenger named Jack Shephard.

448
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:57,133
He says he knows you. okay, sir.

449
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:03,133
Well, hello, doc.

450
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,633
Small world.

451
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,466
What are you doing going to Guam?

452
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,799
What are you doing here, Frank?

453
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,799
Well, I picked this gig up about eight months ago.

454
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,799
I fly this route all the time.

455
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,966
Sometimes I take the big birds into New... Delhi.

456
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,300
Is...

457
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:23,333
That Sayid?

458
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,367
And Hurley.

459
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,333
Wait a second.

460
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,933
We're not going to Guam, are we?

461
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,000
How can you read?

462
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,466
My mother taught me.

463
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,200
I can read, jack,

464
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,499
Because it beats what you're doing.

465
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:06,399
What's that? waiting for something to happen

466
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:12,367
And what is gonna happen?

467
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:14,166
You tell me, Jack.

468
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,750
You're the one that got to stay

469
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,300
After school with Ms. Hawking.

470
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,866
Did you know that Locke killed himself?

471
00:36:27,766 --> 00:36:30,267
No. no, I didn't.

472
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,766
They found this stuffed in his pocket.

473
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:45,532
And I've been trying to get rid of it,

474
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,799
But it's like it's...

475
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:50,833
Following me.

476
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,100
I know it sounds crazy, but...

477
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:58,599
It feels like John needs me to read it.

478
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,100
Why don't you then?

479
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:10,900
Is it because you're afraid?

480
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:12,933
Afraid of what?

481
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,000
Afraid that he blames you,

482
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:17,866
That it's your fault he killed himself.

483
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,300
Was it my fault?

484
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,799
No, Jack, it wasn't your fault.

485
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:34,033
Let me give you some privacy.

486
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,733
Dude...

487
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:52,399
You might wanna fasten your seat belt.

488
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,200
Fasten your seat belt, ma'am. sir?

489
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,799
Please put on your seat belts. seat belt, please.

490
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:39,333
Help!

491
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:41,566
Anyone!

492
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,766
Help!

493
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,432
Kate.

494
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,733
Kate.

495
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:18,367
What happened?

496
00:40:24,532 --> 00:40:27,633
- Can you get up? - yeah.

497
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,766
The plane...

498
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,532
Where's the plane?

499
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:39,799
I don't know.

500
00:40:39,833 --> 00:40:42,166
After that light, i...

501
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,166
I woke up in the jungle.

502
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,399
So this is it? it's just us?

503
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:47,933

504
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,699

505
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:53,166
Crashing? no. one second, I'm being tossed around.

506
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,866
The next thing I know, I'm in the lagoon.

507
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,267
Where's Sun and Sayid?

508
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,166
Where's Ben?

509
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,466
All right. let's spread out, search the jungle.

00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:09,233
We come across anybody from the plane, we'll--

511
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,100
Dude...

512
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:35,133
Jin??
