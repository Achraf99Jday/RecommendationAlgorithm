1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:01,798
On "Lost":

2
00:00:02,743 --> 00:00:03,743
No, no!

3
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:04,744
Desmond.

4
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,171
I need you to go back
to Oxford Universtiy.

5
00:00:08,672 --> 00:00:10,172
Go back to where...

6
00:00:10,173 --> 00:00:11,173
I gotta find my...

7
00:00:14,784 --> 00:00:17,519
What happens if I can't
get them all to come back?

8
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:20,856
Then God help us all.
- I'm going back to the island today...

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,007
just as soon as I do one thing--

10
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:27,262
kill your daughter.
- What are you doing here?

11
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,031
Desmond?!

12
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,303
He's coding!

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,875
Gunshot wound. He's crashing.
- Bay 7. Now!

14
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,878
Is he gonna be okay?
- You're gonna have to wait here, ma'am.

15
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,366
Where are you--where are you
taking him? What's happening?

16
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,448
Please, ma'am, wait here.

17
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,014
We'll let you know as
soon as we know anything.

18
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,451
Well, what's happening?
Is he gonna be okay?

19
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:51,696
We're going to do everything
we can. Please just wait.

20
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:52,420
Daddy!

21
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55,857
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

22
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:07,903
How old is your son?

23
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,971
He's 2.

24
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:15,010
He has his father's hair.

25
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:20,215
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

26
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:23,018
Uh, no,
but your husband does.

27
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:25,186
I'm Eloise Hawking,

28
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,656
and I believe
it's my son's fault

29
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,992
that Desmond has been shot.

30
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,895
Your son is Benjamin Linus?

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,364
Good Lord, no.

32
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:43,171
My son is Daniel Faraday.

33
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,915
Hey, can I get a hand
with this?

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,450
Yeah, yeah.

35
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:02,991
Dan.

36
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:07,062
Hey, Miles.
Long time no see.

37
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,097
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:11,900
you know why you're here.
I wish you could all get

39
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:12,928
a good night's sleep, but, uh...

40
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,636
What the hell are you doing back here, Dan?

41
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,539
Once you left for Ann Arbor,
I figured you'd gotten rich,

42
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:18,781
invented the DVD or something.

43
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:21,076
The shuttle will pick
you up at the motor pool...

44
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,611
<i>This</i> is what
I'm doing back here.

45
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:24,167
When did they get here?

46
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:25,413
A few days ago. It's weird, huh?
LaFleur managed to--

47
00:02:25,448 --> 00:02:27,682
We don't have time.
I need you

48
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,884
to take me to Jack's
right now, okay?

49
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,063
Jack. How did you get back here?
- Faraday? What the--

50
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,932
how did you do it?
- Whoa.

51
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:46,668
How did you get back to the island?
- Where have you been?

52
00:02:46,702 --> 00:02:49,337
I was--I was just at Dharma
headquarters in Ann Arbor.

53
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:51,072
I was doing some research.

54
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:53,575
What's more important
right no..

55
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:56,678
How did you get back here to 1977?
- What's going on?

56
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:59,324
Don't look at me.
I just carried his luggage.

57
00:02:59,325 --> 00:02:59,948
Jack, how?

58
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:02,650
Uh... we were on a plane,
and then there was--

59
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:05,253
Who told you
to get on a plane?

60
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:08,490
As a matter of fact, Dan,
it was your mother.

61
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:12,794
And how did she
convince you, Jack?

62
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:15,964
Did she tell you
it was your destiny?

63
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:19,667
Yeah. That's exactly what
she said.

64
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:22,370
Well, I got some bad news
for you, Jack.

65
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,806
You don't belong here
at all.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,509
She was wrong.

67
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,559
(playing classical music,

68
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,395
metronome clicking loudly)

69
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:08,790
What's wrong, Mom?
Didn't you like it?

70
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,994
I loved it.

71
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:14,029
It was beautiful, Daniel.

72
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,573
Daniel...

73
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:28,277
do you know
what destiny means?

74
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,212
No.

75
00:04:30,246 --> 00:04:31,880
Destiny means that,

76
00:04:31,915 --> 00:04:35,817
if one has a special gift,

77
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:38,253
then it must be nurtured.

78
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,758
How many beats
has that metronome counted

79
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,726
since you started playing?

80
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:47,095
864.

81
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:54,136
Your gift, Daniel,
is your mind--

82
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,906
a mind that is meant
for science, mathematics.

83
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,311
And it's my... job

84
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:06,114
to keep you on your path.

85
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,518
So... unfortunately,

86
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:13,588
there's no more time...
for distractions.

87
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,757
But I <i>want</i> to
keep playing the piano.

88
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,026
I can do both.

89
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:21,964
I can <i>make</i> time.

90
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:25,934
If only you could.

91
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:35,510
Miles, I need you to bring me
to the Orchid.

92
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,980
Can you drive me right now?
Please?

93
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:39,982
Yeah, yeah, sure. I guess.
- Thanks.

94
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,383
Come on. Let's go.

95
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,318
Faraday! Wait up!

96
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:45,387
Miles, come on.
Jack, we'll be right back.

97
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:48,390
Hey, what did you mean,
you mother was wrong? Daniel!

98
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:51,827
I just--I just have an errand
to run. Be right back!

99
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:00,402
Yeah?
- Faraday's back.

100
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,738
What do you mean
Faraday's back? Why?

101
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:06,108
I have no idea. He came in
on the sub, and he woke me up.

102
00:06:06,142 --> 00:06:08,110
He--he started talking
nonsense,

103
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:10,112
and then he took off
for the Orchid.

104
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:12,748
I'd love to trade theories
about this,

105
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:14,183
But I'm a little busy right now.

106
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,284
What are you busy with
at 6:00 in the morning?

107
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,053
James, tell him.

108
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,756
Get in here.

109
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:30,298
Phil--
one of my security guys--

110
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,801
got himself a videotape
of me and Kate

111
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:35,203
taking the kid
out to the hostiles.

112
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,939
And where's the tape?
- With Phil.

113
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,908
And where is Phil?

114
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:45,614
Phil, Jack. Jack... Phil.

115
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,225
Are we...

116
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,928
waiting for something?

117
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:05,500
Right on time.

118
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,643
I'll be back in ten minutes.

119
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,963
So what <i>do</i> you want me
to do?

120
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,798
You're gonna do nothing.

121
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,400
If you drill
even 1 centimeter further,

122
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,935
you risk releasing that energy.

123
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,937
If that were to happen...

124
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,606
then God help us all.

125
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,076
Hey! You need a hard hat down here.

126
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:57,886
Watch yourself!

127
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,655
Sorry, sir.
Won't happen again.

128
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,659
Come on.

129
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:07,195
I'll grab the rest
of his stuff. Let's go.

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,503
Did you <i>hear</i> that?

131
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,973
Time travel. How stupid
does that guy think we are?

132
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,645
Dr. Chang?

133
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,313
Dr. Chang?

134
00:08:25,348 --> 00:08:28,550
Do you have a second, sir?
- I suppose.

135
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,153
I just came in on the sub
with the Swan team.

136
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,588
We actually met three years ago,
I'm Daniel Faraday.

137
00:08:33,623 --> 00:08:35,857
Yes. Yes. Uh, you arrived
with LaFleur. I remember.

138
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:36,158
Right.

139
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:38,193
What can I do for you?

140
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,195
I need you to order
the evacuation

141
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,497
of every man, woman and child
on this island.

142
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:45,033
And why would I do that?

143
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,035
Because that man
is on a stretcher

144
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,304
as a consequence
of the electromagnetic activity

145
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:51,706
that your drilling
unleashed down here.

146
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,277
Which is now contained.

147
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,615
It's contained down here.

148
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,385
But in about six hours,

149
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,520
the same thing
is gonna happen

150
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,089
at the site
for the Swan Station,

151
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:11,159
only the energy there is about
30,000 times more powerful, sir.

152
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:13,395
And the accident...

153
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,463
it's gonna be catastrophic.

154
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:17,866
That is utterly absurd.

155
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,868
What could possibly
qualify you

156
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,804
to make
that kind of prediction?

157
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:24,072
Hmm?

158
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:28,109
I'm from the future.

159
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,660
Dr. Chang, wait!

160
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:37,874
Will you wait one second, please?
Wait one--one second.

161
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,197
Yes, yes, you're
from the future.

162
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:42,067
You heard me talking
out time travel.

163
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,437
Now you've had your fun. Good for you.
- No, no. <i>Please,</i> Dr. Chang.

164
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,739
Just look at my journal, please.
Look at these equations.

165
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:50,375
Some of them won't be discovered
for another 20 years.

166
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:51,976
Dr. Chang--
- Hey! Hey!

167
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,112
Hey! Hey! Hey, Dan!
Leave the man alone.

168
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:56,915
Sorry, Dr. Chang. I think he had
too many drugs on the sub--

169
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,350
Dr. Chang...

170
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:01,152
Miles is your son.

171
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,091
Excuse me?
- Think about it.

172
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:11,129
A Chinese man named Miles--
the same name as your baby--

173
00:10:11,163 --> 00:10:13,598
shows up with me
from the future.

174
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:17,902
You--you <i>really</i> think
this is all coincidence?

175
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:23,108
Is this true?

176
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:24,609
No.

177
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,912
<i>Please...</i>

178
00:10:27,947 --> 00:10:29,647
Stay away from me.

179
00:10:29,682 --> 00:10:31,516
Dr. Chang...

180
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,318
Dr. Chang!

181
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:33,677
If you--

182
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:35,386
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Are you out of your mind?

183
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,689
What are you doing?
- I'm just making sure

184
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:39,817
that your father does
what he's supposed to do.

185
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:40,558
And what's that?

186
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,562
You'll see.

187
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,808
Hi, Mom.

188
00:10:56,842 --> 00:10:58,910
I want you to meet Theresa.

189
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:00,950
Dan's told me so much about--

190
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,846
Pleased to meet you.

191
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,848
Well done, Daniel.

192
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:07,118
Ah...
- You much be so proud of him.

193
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,687
Daniel, I thought we could
celebrate your accomplishment

194
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:11,222
with lunch.

195
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:14,159
There's a nice restaurant
nearby. I reserved us a table.

196
00:11:14,193 --> 00:11:16,461
We would love to.

197
00:11:17,997 --> 00:11:21,633
Actually, I was hoping
it would be just the two of us.

198
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:23,501
You do understand,
don't you?

199
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:27,038
It's just that I don't get
to see my son very often.

200
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:29,140
Mother...
- I understand.

201
00:11:29,175 --> 00:11:31,376
It's okay, Dan. Really.

202
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,316
Is there something
bothering you, Daniel?

203
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:42,187
You were so rude to Theresa.

204
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,355
Was I?

205
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,092
Theresa is my girlfriend.
- She is your research assistant.

206
00:11:49,862 --> 00:11:52,430
You should be focusing
your energies on your work.

207
00:11:52,464 --> 00:11:55,500
On my work.
- Yes. <i>That</i> is what is important.

208
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:58,336
Yes. You've made it
abundantly clear.

209
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,540
Why would I waste my gift on a woman--
- I'm sorry to tell you, Daniel,

210
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:05,076
but you're not going to
have time for relationships.

211
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,012
The women in your life
will only be terribly hurt.

212
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:12,050
What does that mean?

213
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:14,886
It means that your work will
always comes first, that's all.

214
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,355
Only because that's what
you always push me to do.

215
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:19,490
You pushed and you pushed
and you <i>pushed.</i>

216
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,093
And when will it be enough,
Mother? When?

217
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:24,462
I'm the youngest doctorate ever
to ever graduate from Oxford.

218
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:26,431
I just got a new

219
00:12:26,465 --> 00:12:29,200
1.5 million pound
research grant.

220
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:32,303
What else do I have to do?
- A grant?

221
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:34,906
That's wonderful! From whom?

222
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,976
I don't know. Um...

223
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,444
some industrialist.

224
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:41,880
Widmore, I think.

225
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:48,920
Charles Widmore.

226
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,460
I don't want to
fight with you, Daniel.

227
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,428
That's not why I came.

228
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:59,631
<i>Why</i> did you come?

229
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,340
To congratulate you.

230
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:21,319
Good luck, Daniel.

231
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:25,356
And I do hope you know
that I mean that.

232
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,863
All right, people.

233
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:07,265
Party's over.

234
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:12,503
I know y'all just showed up.

235
00:14:12,538 --> 00:14:16,040
The rest of us have been here
for the past three years.

236
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:18,309
This is our home.

237
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,979
The last thing I wanna do
is leave.

238
00:14:21,013 --> 00:14:22,318
But we ain't got no choice.

239
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,316
Well, that dude in the closet--
I thought he worked for you.

240
00:14:25,351 --> 00:14:28,252
Can't you convince him
that it was all, like,

241
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,166
a misunderstanding?

242
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,155
I punched the man
in the damn face, Hugo.

243
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,758
What am I supposed to say--
"my fist slipped"?

244
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,739
How much time do we have before
someone realizes he's gone?

245
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,328
Not enough.

246
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,297
So where do we go?

247
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,234
We only got two options.

248
00:14:43,268 --> 00:14:45,336
We can either
commandeer the sub,

249
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,373
get the hell off this island
before anyone knows we're gone,

250
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,341
or we can head back
in the jungle,

251
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:52,844
start from square one.

252
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:54,979
I'm not getting on that sub

253
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:57,406
if there's a chance that my
wife is still on this island.

254
00:14:57,407 --> 00:14:58,149
Yeah, me neither.

255
00:14:58,183 --> 00:15:00,118
After all we did
to get back here?

256
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:02,120
And now we're just gonna
run off again?

257
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:04,489
It'd be kinda wishy-washy.

258
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:07,588
Right. That's two votes for
square one. Anybody else wanna--

259
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,800
Hold your horses.
Be right there.

260
00:15:24,977 --> 00:15:27,779
Hey, James.

261
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:31,182
Welcome to the meeting,
twitchy.

262
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:33,184
Good to see you again.

263
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:35,953
Pound cake's in the kitchen.
Help yourself to the punch.

264
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:39,457
Is he still crazy?
- It's on a whole new level, man.

265
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,459
Great.

266
00:15:43,362 --> 00:15:46,831
Jack, I'm sorry I was rude
before, but what I came to do

267
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:50,701
is of critical importance
to everyone in this room.

268
00:15:50,736 --> 00:15:54,338
Does anyone know
where I can find the hostiles?

269
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,345
Why do you need
to know that, Daniel?

270
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:06,117
Because one of them
is my mother.

271
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:12,123
And she is the only person
on this island

272
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:14,759
who can get us back
to where we belong.

273
00:16:24,877 --> 00:16:27,178
<i>Comes to us from</i>

274
00:16:27,213 --> 00:16:29,614
<i>the "Christiane I," a salvage</i>
<i>vehicle in the Indian Ocean.</i>

275
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,649
How do you want your eggs, Dan?
<i>For more than two months,</i>

276
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:34,018
<i>it's been scouring the depths</i>
<i>of the Sunda trench off Bali...</i>

277
00:16:34,053 --> 00:16:36,054
So what happened?
They found that missing plane?

278
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,489
<i>In search of the long-missing</i>
<i>Oceanic Flight 815.</i>

279
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:38,723
Dan?

280
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:41,259
<i>Late last night, the" Christiane" deployed</i>

281
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,862
<i>two remotely operated
vehicles, or R.O.V.S...</i>

282
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:43,661
Dan. Why are you so upset?

283
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,496
<i>That verified what</i>

284
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:47,465
<i>the National Transportation</i>
<i>Safety Board had long feared...</i>

285
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:49,067
I don't know.
<i>- That the commercial aircraft...</i>

286
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,004
<i>on September 22nd, 2004...</i>

287
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,176
You have a visitor, Dan.

288
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,612
Would you like some tea?

289
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,580
That would be lovely.

290
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:04,582
Hello, Daniel.

291
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,258
I'm sorry, sir. I don't...

292
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:17,262
D-did Caline tell you
I have a condition

293
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,230
that affects my memory?
- Just...

294
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,199
don't be embarrassed.
We've never met.

295
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,601
My name is Charles Widmore.

296
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:26,070
Charles...

297
00:17:27,606 --> 00:17:30,074
Charles Widmore from...

298
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,910
my research grant?

299
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,980
It's very nice to meet
you, sir. Please, sit down.

300
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,448
Um...

301
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,251
Mm, a bit of a mess.

302
00:17:40,286 --> 00:17:42,253
I meant to thank you

303
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:44,489
before I...

304
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,124
before I left Oxford.

305
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:49,027
You mean,
before you were dismissed.

306
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,098
I tested that...

307
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:56,367
I tested that
on myself first.

308
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,170
It's all right, Daniel.
- I would <i>never</i> hurt Theresa.

309
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:00,905
It's all right.

310
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,541
That's not why I'm here.

311
00:18:03,575 --> 00:18:07,278
I came to offer you
a new opportunity.

312
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,851
N-no, I...

313
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:17,755
I'm sorry. I-I can't.
I don't think I-I can...

314
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,929
Did I say something
to upset you?

315
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:28,266
It's this plane crash.

316
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,869
I don't know why
it's bothering me so much.

317
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:35,239
It's just so sad.

318
00:18:35,274 --> 00:18:37,241
They're dead.

319
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:43,381
Daniel, what if I told you...

320
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,049
they're not dead?

321
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,420
What if I told you

322
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,456
the plane was a fake?

323
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,860
An elaborate...
expensive fake.

324
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:00,198
How would you know that?

325
00:19:00,232 --> 00:19:03,935
Because I put it there.

326
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,442
Well...

327
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,711
Why would you tell me at?

328
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:19,450
Because come tomorrow,
you won't remember I did.

329
00:19:21,253 --> 00:19:23,287
Daniel,

330
00:19:23,322 --> 00:19:26,424
the real Oceanic Flight 815
crashed on an island--

331
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,159
a special island

332
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:32,630
with unique
scientific properties.

333
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:36,868
I want to send <i>you</i>
to the island.

334
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:40,438
It will further
your research,

335
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,507
show you things

336
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,675
you'd never dream of.

337
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,079
But more importantly,

338
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:50,415
it will heal you, Daniel--

339
00:19:50,449 --> 00:19:52,683
Your mind,

340
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:55,787
your memory.

341
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:57,455
H-heal me?

342
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,496
W-why are you doing
all this for me?

343
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,567
Because you're a man
of tremendous gifts,

344
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,537
and it would be a shame
to see them go to waste.

345
00:20:16,575 --> 00:20:19,277
You sound like my mother.

346
00:20:21,814 --> 00:20:24,248
That's because
we're old friends.

347
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:35,059
You're mother is an other?

348
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,694
You met her, actually,

349
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:39,664
when the island was skipping,
back in 1954.

350
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,699
They were calling her "Ellie."

351
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,868
You guys were in 1954?

352
00:20:43,902 --> 00:20:45,048
Like... Fonzie times?

353
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,939
You still haven't told
us why you need to find her.

354
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,075
I just need to talk to her.

355
00:20:49,076 --> 00:20:51,075
I thought you said we
were supposed to lay low.

356
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,246
"Whatever happened, happened"?

357
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,911
Just tell me where
they are, and I'll go--

358
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:56,314
I'm <i>not</i> telling you <i>anything,</i>
and you ain't going anywhere

359
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:57,915
unless you wanna

360
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,518
share with us what the hell
it is you're doing.

361
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,287
Sawyer, he said he can get us
back to where we belonged.

362
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,124
Whether we go on the sub or we
head back into the jungle...

363
00:21:06,158 --> 00:21:07,089
We don't belong here.

364
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,660
Well, I belonged here just
fine till you came back, doc.

365
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,767
You know where
the hostiles are.

366
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,539
What?
- You and Sawyer took Ben out to them.

367
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,017
Can you get us back out there?

368
00:21:23,018 --> 00:21:25,376
Whoa, hold on a second.
Don't say a word, Kate.

369
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,879
She can say what she wants
to say. Kate...

370
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,681
You made me promise to never ask
what happened to Aaron,

371
00:21:30,716 --> 00:21:32,950
or why you came back here.

372
00:21:32,985 --> 00:21:35,686
But I know that reason isn't...
it isn't here.

373
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,355
It's not now.

374
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:39,023
Whatever her reason is,

375
00:21:39,057 --> 00:21:41,526
helping H.G. Wells here
talk to his mommy

376
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,862
ain't got nothing
to do with it.

377
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:46,864
Come with us, freckles.

378
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,139
The Code for the fence

379
00:21:55,174 --> 00:21:57,742
is 1-4-1-7-1-7.

380
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,478
You should take Daniel.

381
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:03,814
It's over here for us
anyway.

382
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,086
Okay.

383
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:12,156
Let's go.

384
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,558
Great.

385
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:14,692
Great. Thank you.

386
00:22:14,726 --> 00:22:17,395
Hey, Miles, can you drive us?

387
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:31,342
When you realize you've made
a huge mistake...

388
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:34,946
We'll be back at the beach,
right where we started.

389
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:42,186
All right, the rest of us--

390
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:46,190
pack anything you can carry,
meet back here in 20 minutes.

391
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:53,064
Time to go.

392
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:02,640
These people are not
gonna be happy to see us.

393
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:05,042
It might be a good idea
to bring some guns.

394
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:07,044
There's a gun safe
in the motor pool,

395
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,579
but it's locked.

396
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:11,682
Good thing I'm a janitor then.

397
00:23:11,717 --> 00:23:14,218
Hey, Dan?

398
00:23:14,253 --> 00:23:17,521
I'll meet you at the motor pool.
I need just a minute. Okay?

399
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:42,513
I'm not allowed
to have chocolate before dinner.

400
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:48,653
It's okay, sweetheart.

401
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:51,656
I won't tell.

402
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,126
My name's Charlotte.

403
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,094
What's yours?

404
00:23:57,129 --> 00:24:00,765
I'm Daniel.

405
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,301
I'm new here.

406
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:08,105
Listen.

407
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,907
Do you know Dr. Chang?

408
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:10,908
Uh-huh.

409
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:11,909
Yeah?

410
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,879
Hopefully really soon,

411
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:18,082
Dr. Chang is gonna ask
a bunch of people

412
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:20,151
to get on the submarine

413
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:23,054
and leave the island.

414
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,257
When he does,
you and your mommy...

415
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:28,659
you're gonna have to leave.

416
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,529
In case
what I do doesn't work,

417
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:33,698
you <i>cannot</i> be here.

418
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,866
You have to leave.

419
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:41,238
I tried to avoid
telling you this.

420
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,441
I didn't think
I could change things.

421
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:49,447
But maybe I can.

422
00:25:00,726 --> 00:25:03,413
Hey, how long will it
take us to get up there?

423
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:04,328
Uh, it depends.

424
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:06,797
We can take the road
until we hit the pylons,

425
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:09,767
but then once we're in their
territory, we gotta go on foot.

426
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,870
Okay. Uh, do you have
something for a beginner?

427
00:25:16,074 --> 00:25:17,575
Let's go.

428
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:22,513
That's ready to go.

429
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,415
What's going on here?

430
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,953
Aren't you one of the physicists
off the sub?

431
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,490
Yeah, that's right. Uh, we
were just making sure that--

432
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,457
You're supposed to
be out at the Swan Site.

433
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:37,595
Right. Uh, there was--

434
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:40,164
there was an accident
at the Orchid Station.

435
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:42,633
Dr. Chang asked us to help.
He's got a gun.

436
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,568
I just <i>left</i> Dr. Chang.

437
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:48,005
He's at home with his wife
and baby. You're lying.

438
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,641
Now drop the guns
and get down on the ground!

439
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,343
Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

440
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,345
You <i>really</i> do not understand
what's happening here.

441
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:57,314
You have no idea. We have
no time. We have to leave.

442
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,750
All right?
So we're just gonna leave.

443
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,619
Okay? Nobody's--no..

444
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:04,155
Aah!

445
00:26:10,095 --> 00:26:12,263
Are you okay?

446
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:21,005
I think we can make it
to the jeep.

447
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,340
All right. I'll cover you.

448
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:25,376
Dan?
- You go, too, all right?

449
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,710
Go, go, go!

450
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:00,945
Sound the alarm!

451
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,935
Hello, Daniel.

452
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:33,404
Mother.

453
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:35,839
When did you get here?

454
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:37,341
Oh, I just arrived.

455
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,310
I would have called you,
but...

456
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:42,146
I would have forgotten
anyway.

457
00:27:44,616 --> 00:27:48,018
I hear you have been
offered a job.

458
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:51,021
How do you know that?

459
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:53,857
Well,
it's my business to know.

460
00:27:53,892 --> 00:27:56,894
I came here, Daniel,

461
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:59,496
To tell you that it is
very important

462
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:02,066
that you say yes
to Mr. Widmore...

463
00:28:03,702 --> 00:28:07,237
that you accept
this opportunity.

464
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,109
I can't.

465
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,813
He needs someone who can do

466
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:18,248
really, really complex
space-time calibrations

467
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:21,652
and calculate bearings,
and I just...

468
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,421
I don't know how to do that
anymore.

469
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:25,923
Daniel...
- Mm.

470
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:30,928
This place he mentioned to you,
this island--

471
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:34,898
did he tell you that
it could make you better?

472
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:41,305
What if it's true?

473
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,775
Why, then you could go on
with your work.

474
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,113
Just think of all
you could accomplish.

475
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:53,617
You really want me to...
to go?

476
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,488
Yes.

477
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:02,226
Will...

478
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,562
will it make you proud of me?

479
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,035
Yes, Daniel.

480
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:13,671
It will.

481
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,250
Then I'll do it.

482
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:44,568
You remember the code?
- Yeah, I got it.

483
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,404
All right, I'm gonna
take a look at that.

484
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,674
Yeah, good.

485
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,643
It's just a graze.
- Whew.

486
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:55,045
This is gonna sting.

487
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,547
Yeah.

488
00:29:58,049 --> 00:29:59,683
Ah.

489
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:02,319
Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

490
00:30:02,353 --> 00:30:03,887
I guess I'm lucky.

491
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:06,657
What's luck have to do with it?

492
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:08,659
I thought you said
whatever happened, happened.

493
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:10,661
You gotta understand, Jack,

494
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:12,396
<i>This</i> is our present.

495
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,365
When we met, did I have
a scar on my neck?

496
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,767
No.

497
00:30:16,801 --> 00:30:19,203
'Cause I hadn't been
shot yet.

498
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:22,406
We can't be so naive as to think
nothing can happen to us.

499
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:27,444
Any one of us can die, Jack.

500
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:29,379
Okay.

501
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:32,049
It's off.

502
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,584
Thanks.

503
00:30:36,187 --> 00:30:38,622
Which way?

504
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:42,025
Just a couple miles in.

505
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,935
Do you think he knows
what he's doing?

506
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,438
I sure hope so.

507
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:56,540
There's no turning back now.

508
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:05,215
You called it the minute
those yahoos got here.

509
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,151
I shoulda listened to you.

510
00:31:12,957 --> 00:31:15,459
Hey.

511
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:17,795
You still got my back?

512
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,766
You still got mine?

513
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,914
That's not good, right?

514
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,620
LaFleur!

515
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,658
Where have you been?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

516
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:50,127
Take it easy, Stu.
What the hell's going on?

517
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:51,862
I just got shot
by a <i>physicist,</i>

518
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,698
and the new recruits
are helping him.

519
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,300
We've been infiltrated.

520
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:59,169
That's ridiculous.
Now just calm down for a minute.

521
00:31:59,204 --> 00:32:02,105
We can talk about this.

522
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,740
What was that?

523
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:06,577
It sounded like
it was from outside.

524
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,261
Get down on the ground now.

525
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:28,065
<i>I said now!</i>

526
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,821
Thank you.

527
00:32:52,924 --> 00:32:55,626
You need a gun to go talk
to your mother, Dan?

528
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,630
You don't know my mother,
Jack.

529
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,935
You ready to tell me
why she was wrong?

530
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:07,938
Why we don't belong here?

531
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:18,849
In about four hours,

532
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:21,652
the Dharma folks
at the Swan work site--

533
00:33:21,686 --> 00:33:24,254
They're gonna--gonna drill
into the ground

534
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,224
and accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

535
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:31,328
The result of the release
of this energy

536
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:32,996
would be catastrophic.

537
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:35,966
So in order to contain it,
they're gonna have to cement

538
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,603
the entire area in,
like Chernobyl.

539
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:42,306
And this containment--the place
they built over it--

540
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,008
I believe you called it
"the hatch."

541
00:33:45,043 --> 00:33:47,511
The Swan hatch?

542
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:53,250
Because of this one accident,

543
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:56,853
these people are gonna spend
the next 20 years

544
00:33:56,888 --> 00:33:59,923
keeping that energy at bay...

545
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:03,093
by pressing a button...

546
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:05,495
a button
that your friend Desmond

547
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,465
will one day fail to push,

548
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:11,868
and that will cause your plane--

549
00:34:11,903 --> 00:34:14,338
Oceanic 815--

550
00:34:14,372 --> 00:34:16,306
to crash on this island.

551
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,109
And because your plane crashed,

552
00:34:19,143 --> 00:34:20,744
a freighter will be sent
to this island--

553
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:22,279
a freighter I was on

554
00:34:22,313 --> 00:34:24,214
and Charlotte was on
and so forth.

555
00:34:24,248 --> 00:34:26,683
This entire chain of events--

556
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:29,686
it's gonna start happening
this afternoon.

557
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,355
But...

558
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,991
we can change that.

559
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:37,327
I studied relativistic physics
my entire life.

560
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:39,796
One thing emerged
over and over--

561
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:41,898
can't change the past.
Can't do it.

562
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,901
Whatever happened, happened.
All right?

563
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:49,239
But then I finally realized...

564
00:34:49,273 --> 00:34:51,475
I had been spending so much time

565
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:54,277
focused on the constants,

566
00:34:54,312 --> 00:34:56,380
I forgot about the variables.

567
00:34:57,882 --> 00:35:00,250
Do you know what the variables
in these equations are, Jack?

568
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,486
No.

569
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,221
Us.

570
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:05,722
We're the variables.

571
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:07,324
People.

572
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:08,859
We think. We reason.

573
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:11,661
We make choices.
We have free will.

574
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:14,464
We can change our destiny.

575
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:20,370
I think
I can negate that energy

576
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,506
under the Swan.

577
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,609
I think I can destroy it.

578
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:28,512
If I can, then that hatch
will never be built,

579
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,881
and your plane...

580
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:32,616
your plane will land,

581
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,785
just like it's supposed to,

582
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:37,220
in Los Angeles.

583
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:46,229
And just how exactly do you plan
on destroying this energy?

584
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,501
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.

585
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,906
Daniel Faraday?

586
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,975
Your son is Daniel Faraday?

587
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,511
Yes.

588
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:17,148
That's the man who sent Desmond
to Los Angeles to find you.

589
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,384
That's right.

590
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:23,054
I came, Penelope,
to apologize.

591
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:27,192
Your husband
has become a casualty

592
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,894
in a conflict
that's bigger than him,

593
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:33,431
that's bigger than any of us.
- What do you mean? Is Des gonna be okay?

594
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:36,234
I don't know.

595
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:38,536
For the first time
in a long time,

596
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,973
I don't know
what's going to happen next.

597
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,910
Ms. Hume?
- Yes?

598
00:36:45,945 --> 00:36:48,604
Your husband's in the recovery
room, and he's asking for you.

599
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:49,848
The recovery room? Is he--

600
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:52,450
He's doing fine.
Come with me.

601
00:36:52,484 --> 00:36:55,019
This nurse will watch your son.

602
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:10,602
Hi.

603
00:37:10,636 --> 00:37:13,238
Hi.

604
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:17,408
I thought I'd lost you.

605
00:37:20,846 --> 00:37:23,281
I promised you, Penny.

606
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:26,017
I promised you...

607
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,556
I'd never leave you again.

608
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,941
Is he all right?

609
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:55,313
Yes, Charles.

610
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:57,248
He's fine.

611
00:37:57,283 --> 00:38:00,051
Good.

612
00:38:00,085 --> 00:38:02,453
Your daughter's in there.

613
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,756
Why don't you go in
and say hello?

614
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,457
Unfortunately, Eloise,

615
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:08,126
my relationship
with Penelope

616
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,495
is one of the things
I had to sacrifice.

617
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:12,964
Sacrifice?

618
00:38:12,998 --> 00:38:17,135
Don't you talk to me
about sacrifice, Charles.

619
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,370
I had to send my son
back to the island,

620
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,905
knowing full well that--

621
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,374
He was my son, too,
Eloise.

622
00:38:45,097 --> 00:38:46,731
This is a mistake.

623
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,366
He's talking about

624
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,135
erasing everything that's
ever happened to us, Jack.

625
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,570
It's insane.

626
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:54,639
We disappeared off a plane
in mid-air

627
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:56,574
and ended up in 1977.

628
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:58,743
I'm getting kinda used
to insane.

629
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:00,645
Well, that should be enough.

630
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:07,285
I think we need more water.

631
00:39:17,296 --> 00:39:19,497
Wish me luck.
- Wait. Hey.

632
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,733
No, let him go.
Let him go.

633
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:42,987
Back up. Step away.
It's okay.

634
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,522
Nobody move.

635
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,924
I only want
to speak to Eloise.

636
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:51,295
Where is Eloise?

637
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,664
Come on. Where is she?

638
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:56,067
I'm sorry, but Elo--

639
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,903
she's not here right now.

640
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,941
Do we know each other?

641
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:06,477
It doesn't matter.

642
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:08,846
I need you
to take me to Eloise.

643
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:10,815
I-I already told
you she's not here.

644
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,451
Let's just take it easy.
- Where's the bomb, Richard?

645
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:17,121
The Hydrogen Bomb that I told
you people to bury--where is it?

646
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:20,491
Listen to me. Lower your gun,
and we'll talk. Okay?

647
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,593
Nobody has to get hurt here.
Just put the gun down.

648
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,797
I'm gonna give you
three seconds.

649
00:40:25,831 --> 00:40:27,899
One...
- Don't do this.

650
00:40:27,933 --> 00:40:29,734
Two...

651
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,016
Why did you do that?
- He had a gun on you.

652
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:48,252
He wasn't gonna shoot me,
Eloise.

653
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,488
Eloise.

654
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:57,795
You knew.

655
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,465
You always knew.

656
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:05,002
You knew
this was gonna happen.

657
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,907
You sent me here.

658
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,212
Who are you?

659
00:41:14,246 --> 00:41:17,882
I...

660
00:41:17,916 --> 00:41:20,151
I'm your son.
