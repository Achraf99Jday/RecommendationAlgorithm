1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,060
Comes fully equipped.

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm telling you, it's a steal at $400.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,560
- What, you gotta check with your husband? - It's just me.

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,650
Mommy?

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,450
Can I have a quarter for the vending machine?

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,470
Honey, I said wait for me by the pool.

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,910
I thought you said it was "just me."

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,430
I meant my husband's out of the picture.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,640
- It's just me and my son. - I don't know.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,550
Most of the other tenants--they don't like noise.

11
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,330
He's very quiet.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,560
I'm gonna need two months up front.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,870
Here, honey.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,060
Hey, no running. you hear me, Miles?

15
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,660
Mom! Mommy! Help!

16
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,760
Mommy!

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,720
Miles?

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,980
Miles, what happened?

19
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,100
Mommy!

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,870
Oh, god.

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,390
Mr. Vonner.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,130
What were you doing in here?

23
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,220
He... He was all alone. He was scared.

24
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,720
His chest hurt. He kept calling out for Kimberly.

25
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,450
Kimberly? That's his wife.

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,630
No, she died last year. Now how would you know that?

27
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,610
- I heard him. - Miles, what are you talking about?

28
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,130
He's still talking right now.

29
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,270
Honey...

30
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,360
He's dead.

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,850
I told you! I can hear him!

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
I can hear him!

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,870
Miles, you there? Pick up.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,760
- Jim, where the hell are you? - I'll fill you in later.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,540
- Right now I need you to take care of something. - Like what?

36
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,260
The security tapes from the pylon camera feeds.

37
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,360
They need to accidentally get erased.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,060
Erased? Why?

39
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,420
I ain't got time for questions, Miles. Just do it.

40
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,530
-Okay. Okay.Uh, which ones? - Look on your monitors.

41
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,310
You see us?

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,020
Yeah. you're on number 4.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,160
Is that kate? What the hell are you doing out there?

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,340
Just erase number 4. and if anyone asks, I'm off the grid.

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,420
I'm looking for the escaped hostile.

46
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,420
You mean your pal Sayid?

47
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,550
Damn it, Miles! You gonna help me or not?!

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,550
-Yeah, Yeah. I got it. - All right. I owe you one.

49
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,120
All right, I want you to go back and and find Juliet,

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,300
See if anyone's noticed yet if little Ben's gone missin'.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,180
What are you gonna do when they find out?

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,030
Do my best to cover it up. In case you haven't noticed,

53
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,480
I'm the head of security.

54
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,410
All right, I'll see you back there.

55
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,630
Where's Lafleur?

56
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,300
Uh, he's, uh, out looking for the escaped prisoner.

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
I tried to get him on his walkie, but...

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,180
- Uh, he must be out of range. - Damn it.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,460
All right. then it's gonna have to be you.

60
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,680
Jim already knows about this,

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
But I'm gonna bring you into the circle of trust.

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,320
Can I trust you, Miles?

63
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,460
Absolutely, Horace.

64
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,610
Okay. Good.

65
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,690
I need you to take this out to Radzinsky at grid 3-3-4.

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,420
He's gonna give you something in return.

67
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,930
I want you to bring it back to me with no questions asked.

68
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,650
You understand?

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,190
We're not supposed to be in 3-3-4.

70
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,500
Isn't that hostile territory?

71
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,740
Welcome to the circle of trust.

72
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,710
Stop right there!

73
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,190
Miles? what are you doing out here?

74
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,330
I was expecting Lafleur.

75
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,280
Lafleur's busy. Horace sent me instead.

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,390
- I'm in the circle of trust. - Get out.

77
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,950
I'm supposed to give you this.

78
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,510
And he said you had something for me.

79
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,810
What happened to him?

80
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,470
He had an accident.

81
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,550
- What kind of accident? - He fell into a ditch.

82
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,060
Is that a bullet hole in his head?

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,960
The ditch had a gun?

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,590
It doesn't matter what happened to him

85
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,360
Because knowing that is not your job.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,540
Your job is to do what I tell you to.

87
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,460
Take him back to Horace now, Miles.

88
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,360
Okay...

89
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,330
So what really happened?

90
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,750
I need to see her.

91
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,930
Ma?

92
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,050
It's me.

93
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,800
Miles.

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
I'm--I'm sorry that...

95
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,890
I couldn't make it by sooner.

96
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,130
It's okay.

97
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,970
You're here now.

98
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,140
Why did you come, Miles?

99
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,780
I need you to tell me

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,830
Why I'm this way...

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,640
How... how I do the things I do.

102
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,520
And I need to know why you won't talk to me about my father.

103
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,980
Because he never cared about us...

104
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,590
Never cared about you.

105
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,020
- I need to know where he is, ma. - It doesn't matter where.

106
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,110
- It does matter. - Miles, please.

107
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,210
- I have a right to know! - He's dead.

108
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,420
Your father...

109
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,300
Kicked us out when you were just a baby.

110
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,940
He didn't want anything to do with us.

111
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,160
So the less you knew about him,

112
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,980
The better.

113
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,160
Why didn't you just tell me?

114
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,270
Because it was over.

115
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,230
Your dad has been dead a long time.

116
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,800
Where's his body?

117
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,390
Somewhere you can never go.

118
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,760
Pierre, if it was caused by the electromagnetism,

119
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,740
We need to know.

120
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,070
You wanna see it now? Yeah, he just got back.

121
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,110
I'll send him out with it right away. Okay.

122
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,220
Did you bring the package?

123
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,240
"package"? You mean the corpse?

124
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,330
Yeah. Now I need you to bring it out to Dr.Chang at the Orchid.

125
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,440
Listen, man. I'm security.

126
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,660
If you just need somebody to drive the van,

127
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,200
Can't someone from the motor pool do it?

128
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,760
If I wanted someone from the motor pool,

129
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,840
I would have asked them.

130
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,800
And since Lafleur decided to disappear, you're all I've got.

131
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,370
So just bring it out to Dr. Chang,

132
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,940
And we'll all call it a day. okay?

133
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,900
Hey! What the hell are you doing?! That's my van!

134
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,630
Nah, dude, I just signed it out.

135
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,010
Doesn't matter. it's mine.

136
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,410
- Well, where you going? - The orchid.

137
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,420
Me. too. I made lunch for the crew. Sandwiches.

138
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,310
Want one? Ham and cheese, and I made my secret garlic mayo.

139
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,310
You're waiting for the next van.

140
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,700
Why? we're going to the same place. Why don't we carpool?

141
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,220
It'll help with global warming, which hasn't happened yet,

142
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,710
So maybe we can prevent it.

143
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,870
- Wait a sec. Are you in some kind of secret mission? - Just get in.

144
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,260
How'd it go?

145
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,170
We gave him to them-- to the others.

146
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,680
- Anyone see you? - I don't think so.

147
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,170
Did James help?

148
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,400
Yes. Thank you so much for sending him.

149
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,350
Of course.

150
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,690
I got here as soon as I could.

151
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,540
All the vans were out, so I had to ru--

152
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,140
Where's Ben?

153
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,920
Did he...

154
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,940
- No, Roger. - Then where is he?

155
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,120
Roger, i-i'm so sorry. i-i was gone for ten minutes.I-i-i don't know.

156
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,070
What? you--you said he was dying. how could he be gone?

157
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,730
I don't know!

158
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm--roger-- what is she telling me, that he just got up and walked out?

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,540
I don't know.

160
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,110
I just got-- you're his doctors! you're supposed to watch him!

161
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,580
- I know. I know. roger, if we just calm down- Don't tell me to calm down!

162
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,480
- Somebody came and took my boy out of here?! - I know. I am so sorry.

163
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,510
I'm going to security.

164
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,660
Here we go.

165
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,750
How do you spell "bounty hunter"?

166
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,560
What are you doing, writing your memoirs?

167
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,740
It's personal.

168
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,430
Dude...

169
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,560
Did you just... you know?

170
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,140
What?

171
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,430
You know.

172
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,870
It stinks. did you...

173
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,290
No.

174
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,660
Well, it wasn't me.

175
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,350
So roll down your window.

176
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,670
Nah, man, there's something foul in here.

177
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,230
It's coming from back there. maybe it's your famous garlic mayo.

178
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,500
Unh-unh. that's not possible.

179
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,180
Okay, maybe it is possible. pull over. I gotta check.

180
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,330
Forget it. you're imagining things. I gotta check.

181
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,300
If those sandwiches are bad, people could get sick.

182
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,520
Will you pull over?!

183
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,810
Dude, there's a body bag back here.

184
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,660
- There's a body in it. - That's traditionally what you put in a body bag.

185
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,170
Yeah, well, who is he? what happened?

186
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,530
Don't worry about it and don't tell anybody you saw him.

187
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Dude, what happened to him?

188
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,560
His name's Alvarez.

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,800
He was digging a hole

190
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,170
And thinking about some chick named Andrea.

191
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,150
Then he felt this sharp pain in his mouth,

192
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,540
Which turned out to be a filling from his tooth

193
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,670
Being yanked right out of its socket and...

194
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,200
Blowing through his brain.

195
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,380
Then he was dead.

196
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,040
How does a filling get blown through someone's head?

197
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,630
Got me. can we go now?

198
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,710
How do you know all this?

199
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,570
Because... I know.

200
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,410
Yeah, but how do you know what he was thinking?

201
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,210
I just know.

202
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
You can talk to dead people.

203
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,340
Can we please just go?

204
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,620
Don't worry, dude. your secret's safe with me.

205
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,770
- You wanna know why? - No.

206
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,360
'cause I can talk to 'em, too.

207
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,170
If you don't mind, mr. Gray,

208
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,620
Can you tell me what happened to him?

209
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,990
Last labor day weekend,

210
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,000
Drunk driver ran the light.

211
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,540
That was that.

212
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,620
Where is your son buried?

213
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,050
We cremated him,

214
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,000
Scattered the ashes on the football field at school.

215
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,860
For what I do, it's much better if there's a body.

216
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,230
Oh, but your ad said you could communicate with the dead

217
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,910
Anytime, anywhere.

218
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,400
- I-i know what my ad says, mr. Gray, but- Please.

219
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,850
I just want you to ask him...

220
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,350
Did he know that I loved him?

221
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,730
It's gonna cost extra.

222
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,690
Of course.

223
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,500
Thank you.

224
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,650
Okay, now...

225
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,210
Please give me your hands.

226
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,850
I want you to concentrate on Russell.

227
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,390
Just get a picture of him in your head.

228
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,430
- Can you do that? - Yeah. okay.

229
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,230
Did it work?

230
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,300
Your son says he knew that you loved him.

231
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,940
He always knew.

232
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,090
- Thank you. - I'm sorry for your loss.

233
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,320
Excuse me.

234
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,810
- Miles Straume? - Yeah.

235
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,280
Hi. my name's Naomi Dorrit.

236
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,010
My employer's been following your work for some time now,

237
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,770
And he's interested in retaining your rather unique services.

238
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,250
There's a restaurant not too far from here.

239
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,130
Would you like to hear what I have to say?

240
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,900
Yeah. absolutely.

241
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,740
Hi, roger.

242
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,280
You okay?

243
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,260
Let me see...

244
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,530
Well, my son got shot

245
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,830
And now he's disappeared, so...

246
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,250
I think I'm pretty far from okay.

247
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,660
You know, I'm sure...

248
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,440
Things are gonna work out.

249
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Well, thanks for the pep talk.

250
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,400
I just have a feeling he's gonna be okay.

251
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,180
What do you mean, a feeling?

252
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
I just don't think that you should give up hope.

253
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,190
Do you know something?

254
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,420
- Do you know what happened to my son? - No, I don't.

255
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,660
Wait a minute.

256
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,170
Why are you so interested in my kid?

257
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,820
You know, I'm sorry I came over here, all right?

258
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,680
I was just trying to help.

259
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,740
Oh, you're trying to help, huh? you wanna help, Kate?

260
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,990
Well, why don't you just mind your own business?

261
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,180
I don't know why you won't just admit it.

262
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,460
You can trust me. I talk to lots of dead people.

263
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,020
So you have conversations with them, like they're your pals?

264
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,420
Sure, all the time. sometimes we even play chess.

265
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,540
You actually see them?

266
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,340
- Of course. why wouldn't i? - Because that's not how it works.

267
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,890
Aha! you wouldn't knowow it works unless you can do it.

268
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,290
What I can do

269
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,950
Has nothing to do with chatting with ghosts, you nitwit.

270
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,820
It's a feeling, a sense.

271
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,530
When somebody's dead, their brain stops functioning,

272
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,030
Which means there's no more talking.

273
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,230
There's just who they were

274
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,470
- And whatever they knew before they died. - That's how it works for me.

275
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,030
Great. I'm happy for you.

276
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,130
You're just jealous my powers are better than yours.

277
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,400
We're here.

278
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,430
Now shut the hell up and deliver your damn sandwiches.

279
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,960
What's he doing here?

280
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,170
Um, he came to deliver lunch to the work crew.

281
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,990
Lunch? your instructions were to come alone.

282
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,450
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone about the body.

283
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,770
He knows?

284
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,590
I'm sorry, sir.

285
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,900
-He--he was rooting around in the back, and he saw it. - Dude.

286
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,590
I can keep a secret.

287
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,790
Well, you'd better...

288
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,770
Hurley, 'cause if you think working in the kitchen is bad--

289
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,070
I like the kitchen.

290
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,840
Well, how do you feel about polar bear feces?

291
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,860
Because if you breathe one word of this,

292
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,650
I'll have you shipped to hydra island

293
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,040
So you can weigh turds for their ridiculous experiments.

294
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,210
Gross.

295
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,010
You two!

296
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,510
Get the package inside.

297
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,520
And you? stay here till I get back.

298
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,070
- You think you can handle that? - Yes, sir.

299
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,820
Dude, that guy's a total douche.

300
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,520
- You are not qualified to be... - That douche is my dad.

301
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,630
You did say you were taking me out to dinner.

302
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,700
No, I said I was taking you to a restaurant.

303
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,390
You wanna tell me what's back here, sweetheart?

304
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,090
Your audition.

305
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:12,000
Look, whatever you got going on here,

306
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,200
This isn't really my thing.

307
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,960
From what I understand, Miles,

308
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,320
If the price is right, this is exactly your thing.

309
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,080
So what can you tell me about this man?

310
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,650
His name's Felix.

311
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,740
He was...

312
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,200
On his way to deliver something to, uh...

313
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,580
A guy named... Widmore.

314
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,610
Deliver what?

315
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,160
A bunch of papers, photos, pictures...

316
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,890
Of...

317
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,840
Empty graves.

318
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,730
A purchase order...

319
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,880
For an old airplane.

320
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,350
So...

321
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,310
Did I pass?

322
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,580
I'm leading an expedition to an island,

323
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,200
And on the island is a man that

324
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,620
Will be very difficult to find.

325
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,080
- That's why I need you. - Need me for what?

326
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,990
This island has a number of deceased individuals...

327
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,600
Residing on it, and as this man is

328
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,610
The one responsible for their being deceased.

329
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,910
We believe they can supply invaluable information

330
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,120
As to his where abouts.

331
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,630
As much as hunting down a mass murderer

332
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,770
Sounds really safe,

333
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,560
Uh, I'm...I'm gonna pass.

334
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,030
Thanks for the audition.

335
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,890
My employer is willing to pay you $1.6 million dollors.

336
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,250
When do we leave?

337
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,980
So anyway...

338
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,030
- I don't want to talk about it. - Are you kidding me?

339
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,530
How weird is it that your dad is

340
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,160
That dude from all those movies.

341
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,330
Only back then, he was called Marvin Candle.

342
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,730
Was that, like, a stage name?

343
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,950
What part of "I don't want to talk about it"
isn't sinkig in?

344
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,390
Well, if you didn't want to talk about it, why'd you tell me?

345
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,590
How long have you known he was your dad?

346
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,130
The third day we were here, I was on line at the cafeteria,

347
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,620
And my mother got in line behind me.

348
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,090
That was my first clue.

349
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,970
But all those Dharma dudes end up dead.

350
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,340
Don't you wanna... save him?

351
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,420
I can't save him.

352
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,480
They're gonna get kill no matter what I do,

353
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,590
So why bother?

354
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,130
I need you to take me to Radzinsky at the work site

355
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,920
Immediately.

356
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:12,600
You...

357
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,740
Hurley...

358
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,950
- You say a word... - Polar bear poop. Got it.

359
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,650
What happened to the body?

360
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,150
What body?

361
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,300
This room is on my rounds. What are you doing here?

362
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,770
I figured I'd cover for ya.

363
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,320
I heard what happened to your son.

364
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,710
Which part...That he got shot

365
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,130
Or that someone kidnapped him from the infirmary?

366
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,450
Then what are you doing here at work?

367
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,940
What else am I gonna do?

368
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,080
Sit around and pray that those idiots are gonna find my boy?

369
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,310
So you can get outta here.

370
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,780
You came in here a couple days

371
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,090
Ago with that woman Kate, right?

372
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:21,860
Yeah.

373
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,250
You know her at all?

374
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,550
Why?

375
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,410
'cause she's got some...

376
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,770
Kinda weird thing for my kid.

377
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,780
First, she shows up at the infirmary

378
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,940
And gave him blood.

379
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,180
But then when he goes missing,

380
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,110
She comes to me and she says,

381
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,750
"Don't worry. He's gonna be okay."

382
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,750
I'm gonna tell you somethin', man.

383
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm beginning to think

384
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,190
That she's got something to do with this.

385
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,130
I should go to Horace,

386
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,840
Report her.

387
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,720
What do you think?

388
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,920
I think, Roger, that, uh,

389
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,110
That you've had a hell of a day, and that's...

390
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,230
Given you a very good excuse to go out and get drunk.

391
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,860
Maybe that's put some...some crazy ideas into your head.

392
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,790
I know that woman, Kate.

393
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,310
She's my friend,

394
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,330
And she would never do anything to hurt your son.

395
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,970
Sure.

396
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,750
So I'm new here, Dr. Chang.

397
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,840
- What is it exactly you do at the orchid? - It's classified.

398
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,110
Oh, really? You can't tell anyone?

399
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,000
Not even your wife?

400
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,410
No.

401
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,390
What about your kids?

402
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,050
I have a 3-monthld son, so, no, I haven't told him.

403
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,010
3 months? Wow! Congrats.

404
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,460
What's his name?

405
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,970
Miles.

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Small world.

407
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,630
That's your name, too. right, Miles?

408
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,290
Yeah.

409
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,650
So are you a fan of jazz, Dr. Chang?

410
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,900
Like Miles Davis?

411
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,150
My wife is.

412
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,850
I like country.

413
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,900
So you two have been here for... three years now.

414
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,320
Must be pretty tight, huh?

415
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,050
Dr. chang and I... don't exactly travel in the same circles.

416
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,680
I wasn't aware there were circles.

417
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,200
Great.

418
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,540
We should all... get together for a beer sometime.

419
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,910
How awesome would that be?

420
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,630
Stop here.

421
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,280
You don't need to wait. I'll get a ride back with Radzinsky.

422
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,390
Dude, what is this place?

423
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,640
And what's up with all the secrecy?

424
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,020
Don't know. Don't care.

425
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,420
Hey, Glenn!

426
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,840
What's the serial number that goes on the hatch list?

427
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,100
4, 8...

428
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,800
15...

429
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,320
16...

430
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,510
23...

431
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,670
Hold on a minute. it's smudged.

432
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,200
- 42. - 42.

433
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,400
How the hell did you know that?

434
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,400
'cause they're building our hatch.

435
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,750
What hatch?

436
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,030
The one that crashed our plane.

437
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,090
Thanks.

438
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:41,990
Hey, miles.

439
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,130
Do I know you?

440
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,000
Miles, my name's Bram.

441
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,590
You owe me a fish taco.

442
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,040
Sorry about that, but your apartment's being watched,

443
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,730
And we had to try our best

444
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,130
To talk you out of working for Charles Widmore.

445
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,850
I have no idea who that is.

446
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,980
He's the man

447
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,160
Who chartered the boat you'll be getting on next week.

448
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,960
And, my friend, you do not want to get on that boat.

449
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,070
Do you know what lies in the shadow of the statue?

450
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,670
No, can't say that I do.

451
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,890
Then you're not ready to go to that island.

452
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,000
But if you come with us--

453
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,600
All those things you've spent your life trying to find out?

454
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,370
You'll know.

455
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,440
You'll know who you are, Miles

456
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,180
Why it is you have a gift,

457
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,040
And most of all,

458
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,760
You'll know about your father.

459
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,250
I don't know where you've been getting your intel,

460
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,290
But I stopped caring about my father a long time ago.

461
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,270
What I do care about is money.

462
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,420
So I'll tell you what.

463
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,230
You want me to pass on going to the island?

464
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,270
It's gonna cost you double what they offered

465
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,790
$3.2 million.

466
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,440
We're not paying you anything.

467
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,470
But all the money in the world

468
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:12,700
Isn't gonna fill that empty hole inside you, Miles.

469
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,770
That's sad, isn't it?

470
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,210
Toss him!

471
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,360
You're playing for the wrong team.

472
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,030
Yeah? What team are you on?

473
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,480
The one that's gonna win.

474
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,850
That hatch they're building?

475
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,350
There's gonna be an accident,

476
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,650
Then they're gonna have to build a computer

477
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,250
With a button you have to push so the world doesn't end.

478
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,510
So your dad...

479
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,810
Is he around...

480
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,120
You know, when we came from? the future?

481
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,490
No.

482
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,730
Well, then this is kind of awesome for you, huh?

483
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,730
How is it awesome?!

484
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,480
Because you get to hang out with him,

485
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,230
You know, get to know him better and stuff.

486
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,130
And don't bother thanking me,

487
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,790
But he was totally down for that beer, dude.

488
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,010
You know, and maybe he'll let you hold baby you,

489
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,620
Or you can change your own diaper or--

490
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,390
Listen up,

491
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,300
'cause we're only gonna have this conversation once.

492
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,590
I don't want to hang out with my dad.

493
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,540
I don't want to know him better and "stuff."

494
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,580
Why not?

495
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,790
Did he beat you up when you were little or something?

496
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,530
He wasn't even around when I was little, you dimwit!

497
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,020
I never knew him until now.

498
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,790
Why am I even telling you this?

499
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,580
'cause you're in pain and you need to let it out.

500
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,290
I'm not in pain. it doesn't matter.

501
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:51,060
My father is dead. he's gone. he never cared about me,

502
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,910
And nothing I can do will ever change that.

503
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,460
But he's not gone. we just dropped him off.

504
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,450
You want to get into my business?

505
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,930
- Let's get into yours!  - Give that back to me.

506
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,940
- How about we read your little diary?  -It's not a diary! It's personal!!

507
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,070
Let's see what's going on in that piece of granite you call a head

508
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,910
Give that-- give that back to me.

509
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,940
- Give it back!  - "exterior--hoth.

510
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,390
"a little spy robot thingy zips through the atmosphere

511
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,960
"and crashes into the snowy planet below.

512
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,550
"that's when Chewbacca shows up

513
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,190
and blasts it away with his crossbow laser.

514
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,290
"he shakes his fury fist in the sky in triumph.

515
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,790
Chewbacca--raaar."

516
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,910
It's "furry."

517
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,830
"furry fist." I need to spell-check it.

518
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,380
What the hell is this?

519
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm writing "empire strikes back."

520
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,650
Uh... I'm sorry. what?

521
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,240
It's 1977, right?

522
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,060
So "Stars Wars" just came out.

523
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,360
And pretty soon, George Lucas

524
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,040
is gonna be looking for a sequel.

525
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,960
I've seen "empire," like, 200 times,

526
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,990
So I figured

527
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,440
I'd make life easier and send him the script...

528
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,650
With a couple improvements.

529
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,320
That has gotta be the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

530
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,170
Oh, yeah?

531
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,110
Well, at least I'm not scared to talk to my own dad.

532
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,900
- James. you're back. - Barely.

533
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,550
You ever had one of those days you feel like

534
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,320
The little Dutch boy with your finger in the...

535
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,200
Doc. hey.

536
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,450
What's going on?

537
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,640
Ben's father thinks that Kate had something to do

538
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,830
with his son going missing.

539
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,710
Why the hell would he think that?

540
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,310
Because she talked to him, tried to make him feel better.

541
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,950
Her heart was in the right place.

542
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,340
Yeah, well, where was her head?

543
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,510
I had a talk with Roger.

544
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,530
I don't think he's gonna say anything to anyone for now.

545
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,680
I just wanted you to know.

546
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,810
Thank you.

547
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,560
-Thanks for filling me in, doc.  - No problem.

548
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,110
Hey, boss.

549
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,750
We got a development. you better come to the office.

550
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,170
Phil, I've been running around the jungle all day,

551
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,320
So whatever developments you got can wait a while.

552
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,540
I know who took the kid.

553
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,080
Yeah? who's that?

554
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,300
You.

555
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,700
Got a perfectly good explanation for what you saw on that tape.

556
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,210
I sure as hell hope so.

557
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,170
You talk to Horace yet?

558
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,810
No. I thought that after three years of working together,

559
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,500
I'd give you the benefit of the doubt--

560
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,750
Get some rope.

561
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,410
Mr. Gray?

562
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,170
I hope you don't mind. your gate was open.

563
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,710
Mr. Straume. of course. of course. no problem.

564
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,490
What, uh, what brings you by?

565
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,610
Well, sir, uh...

566
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm about to go on a boat trip for a while,

567
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,390
And...

568
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,640
I wanted to give this back to you

569
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:42,970
I lied to you, Mr. Gray.

570
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,930
I wasn't able to talk to your son.

571
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,380
Why are you telling me this?

572
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,540
You could have just let me go on believing what you said.

573
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,280
- That wouldn't have been fair to your son. - I'm sorry?

574
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,850
If you needed your son to know that you loved him,

575
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
You should've told him when he was still alive.

576
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,280
Sorry I said you were afraid to talk to our dad, dude.

577
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,210
Don't worry about it.

578
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,830
I used to hate my dad, too.

579
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,270
He left when I was 10.

580
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,410
But the best thing I ever did was give him a second chance.

581
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,010
We got to be the best of friends,

582
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,020
And although I may never see him again,

583
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,240
I miss him.

584
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,710
And I know he feels the same.

585
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,510
My dad didn't leave when I was 10.

586
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,040
I-I was a baby. I never knew him.

587
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,640
And I don't want to.

588
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,190
It's not happening.

589
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,930
That was Luke's attitude,too.

590
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,340
What?

591
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,470
In "empire," Luke found out Vader was his father,

592
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,910
But instead of putting away his lightsaber

593
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:30,980
And talking about it,

594
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,340
He overreacted and got his hand cut off.

595
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,410
I mean, they worked it out eventually, but at what cost?

596
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,260
Another death star was destroyed,

597
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,190
Boba Fett got eaten by the Sarlacc,

598
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,700
And we got the Ewoks.

599
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,490
It all could've been avoided

600
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,010
If they'd just, you know, communicated.

601
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,220
And let's face it. the Ewoks sucked, dude.

602
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,930
Hello? Oh, one moment.

603
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,170
It's for you.

604
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,560
Miles? I need you.

605
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,280
You do?

606
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,460
Sub's here from H.Q.

607
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,780
I need your help bringing them in.

608
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,400
Sure. new recruits?

609
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,670
No, uh, scientists from Ann Arbor.

610
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,750
Get your van, and let's get to the dock.

611
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,770
Hey, can I get a hand with this?

612
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,050
Yeah, yeah, sure.

613
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,840
- Dan.  - Hey, Miles.

614
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,010
Long time no see.
