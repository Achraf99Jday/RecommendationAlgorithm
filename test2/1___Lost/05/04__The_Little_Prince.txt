1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:00,580
Addic7ed

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,380
Addic7ed

3
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,789
Previously on "lost"... How did you know my father?

4
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,429
He came to see his daughter. My daughter was on your plane.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,570
Her name was claire.

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,119
We're here to get a blood sample from you

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,099
And one from your son aaron. Why?

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,669
To determine your relationship to the child.

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,399
Where you going, mommy?

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,549
We're going on vacation, baby.

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,289
Wait, you're in l.A.? Of course I can meet, yeah.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,210
Hello, kate.

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,060
You okay? Get me to the car.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,959
Sayid, you've been attacked. Where's hurley?

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,819
The only way to save the island, john,

16
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,780
Is to get your people back here. How? How am I supposed to do that?

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,120
What? You've...

18
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,750
Do you know what's happening to me?

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,170
Charlotte? Charlotte?

20
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,450
Hey. Oh, you don't have to whisper.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,870
When he's out, he's out.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,109
At least one of us can sleep.

23
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,799
It's gonna take more than two nights

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,710
For me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed.

25
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,780
What are we gonna do about him?

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,830
About aaron.

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,919
I don't know.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,560
I've been thinking a lot about him.

29
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,779
Did you know that claire was flying to l.A.

30
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,860
To give him up for adoption? No. No, I didn't.

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,980
I think we should say he's mine.

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,009
What? We could say that I was six months pregnant

33
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,069
When I was arrested

34
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,109
And that I gave birth to him on the island.

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,999
No one would ever know.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,910
Kate, no. You don't have to...

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,139
There's other ways to do this.

38
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,749
After everyone we've lost-- michael, jin, sawyer...

39
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,420
I can't lose him, too.

40
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,569
Sawyer's not dead.

41
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,270
No.

42
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,520
But he's gone.

43
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,830
Good night, jack.

44
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,420
Kate...

45
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,449
If we're gonna be safe,

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,339
If we're gonna protect the people that we left behind,

47
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,700
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to convince everyone to lie.

48
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,459
If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it.

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,950
So I'm gonna turn to you first.

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,180
Are you with me?

51
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,850
I have always been with you.

52
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,109
How does it fit?

53
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,750
It's perfect. Thank you for the loaner. Looks great on you.

54
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,349
Are you sure you want to do this? It was your idea.

55
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,180
Mommy!

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,459
Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand.

57
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,009
I'll be right back. Okay? And then we can go home.

58
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,319
Don't worry about us, kate.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,829
There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on tv.

60
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,600
We're going to be just fine here.

61
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,389
Sun...

62
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,690
I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here.

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,599
Thank you.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,240
It's what any friend would do.

65
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,399
Okay, well, I will be back soon.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,129
Okay, you be good for sun.

67
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,730
Okay, honey?

68
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,990
Good luck.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,129
Delivery for you, ms. Kwon.

70
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,750
Thank you. Thanks.

71
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,070
I'll be right back, honey.

72
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,149
Charlotte Charlotte

73
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,019
What's wrong with her

74
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,910
She's been out for ten minutes. Stop shouting, james

75
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,230
Hey, man.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,190
Thank you.

77
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,279
If there's something that you want to tell me, daniel,

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,529
Now would be a good time. I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

79
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,159
She's asking if you know why your girlfriend

80
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,399
Had a seizure. Give us some space, would you

81
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,939
She's like this 'cause the sky keeps lighting up.

82
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,400
He knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it. James...

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,590
Go away.

84
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,130
Did you know that this would happen?

85
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,619
I thought...

86
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,740
I thought it might.

87
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,769
I think it's neurological.

88
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,799
Our brains have an internal clock,

89
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,709
A sense of time.

90
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,829
The flashes... Throw the clock off.

91
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,720
It's like really bad jet lag.

92
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,470
Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, daniel.

93
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,980
You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us? I don't know.

94
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,110
But thank god it's not.

95
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,359
Thank you for waiting.

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,909
Did my assistant offer you something

97
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,939
To drink? Um, yes. I'm fine, thank you

98
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,670
Good. Please, ms. Austen, sit.

99
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,440
So...

100
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,980
How can I help you?

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,840
Mr. Norton,

102
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,779
When you came to my house looking for blood samples

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,750
From me and my son,

104
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,039
I asked you who your client was...

105
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,249
And I said I couldn't tell you.

106
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah. I'm here to offer you a deal.

107
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,090
I'll give you the blood samples,

108
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,220
But first, I wanna talk to your client.

109
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,979
Considering what you're asking for,

110
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,159
That's more than reasonable.

111
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,369
Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today,

112
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,639
And I will be sure to pass along your offer.

113
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,640
But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be--

114
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,209
No.

115
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,299
And the reason, of course,

116
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,019
Is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals,

117
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,689
And we both know it.

118
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,759
I have a signed court order compelling you

119
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,919
To let us confirm that you're the child's mother.

120
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,939
I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it,

121
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,059
But my client insists that we...

122
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,560
Handle the exchange of custody quietly.

123
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,719
What do you mean "exchange of custody"?

124
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,269
You know exactly what I mean.

125
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,930
No, i...

126
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,500
Mr. Norton,

127
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,219
I just wanna know who is doing this to me.

128
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,540
You did this to yourself.

129
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,890
Now it is time you prepare yourself, ms. Austen.

130
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,810
You are going to lose the boy.

131
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,930
We have to go back to the orchid.

132
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,799
Excuse me?

133
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,269
The orchid.

134
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,870
That's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

135
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,470
That greenhouse is a long ways away.

136
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,869
You said you had a zodiac raft back at the beach.

137
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,939
We could take that, cut around the horn of the island,

138
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,879
Be at the orchid in half the time. And let me guess.

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,859
You know exactly what to do when we get there. No, not exactly at all,

140
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,769
But I know that ben used it to leave the island.

141
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,599
And if I can do the same thing,

142
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,839
I believe I can save us. And how you gonna do that

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,759
This is all happening because they left.

144
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,929
I think it'll stop if I can bring them back.

145
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,859
Bring who back? Jack, sun, sayid, hugo, kate.

146
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,209
The boat blew up, and that chopper was

147
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,369
Probably on it. They're not dead, james

148
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,780
Says who? That doesn't matter.

149
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,509
All that matters is they've gotta come back.

150
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,250
I have to make them come back...

151
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,010
Even if it kills me.

152
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,840
Don't you want 'em to come back, james?

153
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,370
Don't you want her to come back?

154
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,650
It doesn't matter what I want.

155
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,870
She's waking up!

156
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,850
Are you okay?

157
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,659
Who are you?

158
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,290
It's me.

159
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,160
It's daniel.

160
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,650
Daniel.

161
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,200
Oh, my head.

162
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,519
What happened?

163
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,730
There was another flash. You passed out.

164
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,889
How do you feel?

165
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,580
A bit dizzy, but...

166
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm fine.

167
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,479
Good.

168
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,580
Hooray. Everything's back to normal.

169
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,869
Now what?

170
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,700
I'll tell you "now what."

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,970
We're going to the orchid.

172
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,760
Oncologist on call to the i.C.U.

173
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,959
Dilation's almost back to normal.

174
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,269
Good. Now take this i.V. Out of my arm, and let's go.

175
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,039
Sayid, you were unconscious for 42 hours.

176
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,589
You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer

177
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,929
In your system. If you sent that man

178
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,849
To hurley's house, we have to leave now

179
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,399
You need to relax. Ben is not gonna hurt hurley.

180
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,439
Ben is on our side.

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,019
The only side he's on is his own.

182
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,819
Dr. Shephard?

183
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm dr. Ariza, director of clinical services.

184
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,700
A word with you, please?

185
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,550
I'll be right back.

186
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,099
What do you think you are doing here?

187
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,689
I was treating a patient.

188
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,929
I apologize. It was an emergency.

189
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,879
I know that-- you were suspended on charges of substance abuse.

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,469
Emergency or not, dr. Shephard,

191
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,829
You have no business being here. I understand

192
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,179
And I take full responsibility for my actions.

193
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,199
No, doctor.

194
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,569
The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions,

195
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,280
And that makes us liable for them.

196
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,280
Excuse me.

197
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,189
Hello? Jack? It's me.

198
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,379
Hurley. Hey, did sayid get to you? Did my dad drop him off?

199
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,629
Yes. He did. Hurley, where are-- is he okay?

200
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,239
He's fine. Awesome.

201
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,589
Hurley, where are you?

202
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,579
Dude, I'm totally cool. I'm in l.A. County lockup.

203
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,839
Oh, and tell sayid I did exactly what he said.

204
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,149
I'm totally safe. Ben's never gonna get me now.

205
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,820
What are you talking about, hurley? Wait! Wait--

206
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,130
Good. You're here. How's sayid?

207
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,380
How you doing today, sir?

208
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,840
Got your meds for you.

209
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,559
Sorry, I think you have the wrong room.

210
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,639
Nope.

211
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,610
Room 133, right?

212
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,599
Got the orders right here. But don't worry.

213
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,350
I won't have to give you an injection.

214
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,160
Put this right in your i.V. Line.

215
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,440
Who are you? Who are you working for?

216
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,420
Okay, talk, talk. Address--it's in my pocket.

217
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,500
Hello, sayid.

218
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,839
What happened?

219
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,690
Do we know anyone who lives at 42 panorama crest?

220
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,630
That's kate's address.

221
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,879
Hello?

222
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,900
Kate? It's jack. Are you okay?

223
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,409
Yeah. I'm fine.

224
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,440
Where are you right now? Are you at home?

225
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,219
Uh... What?

226
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,119
Listen, I'll explain everything once you're out,

227
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,039
But you've gotta get aaron-- look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm...

228
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,219
Aaron is at a hotel with sun.

229
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,529
Sun? Sun's in l.A.?

230
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,900
Yeah, she's here on business.

231
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,449
Listen, jack, this is really not a good time.

232
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,409
I'm so sorry that I even picked up the phone. I'm not--

233
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,169
Kate, do not hang up on me. Please listen. Listen, uh...

234
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,970
Will you tell me where you are? I need to see you?

235
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,750
Kate, please.

236
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,079
I'm downtown.

237
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,659
Wilshire and olive. Okay. All right. I'm on my way.

238
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,079
She's not at home, but I'm gonna go to her right now.

239
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,979
Good. I'll go deal with hugo.

240
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,689
Sorry, ben. I'm not letting you get anywhere near him.

241
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,139
You have friends in trouble. Let's get them to safety

242
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,240
And save the dirty linen for later.

243
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,110
I'll drive.

244
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,719
After you get kate,

245
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,379
Meet us at the long beach marina, slip 23.

246
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,050
And, jack... Hurry. We're running out of time.

247
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,210
Hey, locke?

248
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,200
What are you gonna say to her?

249
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,699
Sorry?

250
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,150
Kate.

251
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,050
What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back?

252
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,779
I haven't figured that out yet.

253
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,409
Well, let me tell you something.

254
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,419
She was pretty excited

255
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,020
To hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here.

256
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,480
What the hell is that?

257
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,800
Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it.

258
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,050
Beach is this way.

259
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,149
Now you wanna take the scenic route?

260
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,930
John...

261
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,760
Do you know when we are?

262
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,720
We need to keep moving.

263
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,339
Hey. How's your headache?

264
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,479
Better.

265
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,100
Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh?

266
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,339
Well, don't worry.

267
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,089
Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the zodiac

268
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,639
Around the other side of the island and rest.

269
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,010
You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. I'm fine.

270
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,890
You okay?

271
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,410
I'm peachy.

272
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,830
Now what?

273
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,960
Nobody move.

274
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,210
James! I got this.

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,369
It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away.

276
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,309
Babies know that stuff.

277
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,159
Okay, no, no, hang on. Listen, listen.

278
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,059
Do you want this baby?

279
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,829
Do you want it to be safe and healthy?

280
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,709
You're not alone in this.

281
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,049
We are all here for you. This baby is all of ours.

282
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,029
But I need you to push.

283
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,780
Okay?

284
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,229
One, two, three...

285
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,940
Push! Push!

286
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,489
Come on, claire! Push!

287
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,849
Aah! Okay! He's coming!

288
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,559
Push! Push! Push! Push!

289
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,770
Push! Push! Push! Push!

290
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,920
James?

291
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,500
What happened?

292
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,870
Did you see something out here, james?

293
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,600
Don't matter.

294
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,940
It's gone now.

295
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,850
You shaved your beard.

296
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,390
Just needed a change.

297
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,540
Look, jack, uh...

298
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,939
I don't know why you called,

299
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,280
But I can't be dealing with this right now.

300
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,229
What's going on?

301
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,279
Nothing. Just...

302
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,189
Can you just go? Why don't you just tell me?

303
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,659
Jack, please, just go.

304
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,570
Kate, please, tell me.

305
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,070
Somebody wants aaron.

306
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,049
What?

307
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,739
There's a lawyer in there.

308
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,849
His clients-- they know we're lying.

309
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,059
They know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away.

310
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,050
Who's gonna take him away?

311
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,539
What--what are you doing?

312
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,030
Look, I gotta go, all right? Get in or don't.

313
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,510
You ready to tell me who you saw back there?

314
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,170
Already told you. It was nothin'.

315
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:29,389
You and I both know when we were before the flash, james.

316
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,589
So who was it you saw?

317
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,940
Charlie? Shannon? Yourself?

318
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,060
And how is it that you knew when we were, johnny boy?

319
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,550
That light in the sky--it was from the hatch, wasn't it?

320
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,810
The night that boone died...

321
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,129
I went out there

322
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,789
And started pounding on it as hard as I could.

323
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,110
I was... Confused... Scared.

324
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,700
Babbling like an idiot,

325
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,090
Asking, why was all this happening to me?

326
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,220
Did you get an answer?

327
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,430
Light came on, shot up into the sky.

328
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,219
At the time, I thought it meant something.

329
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,669
Did it?

330
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,020
No. It was just a light.

331
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,879
So why'd you turn us around then?

332
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,180
Don't you wanna go back there?

333
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,070
Why would I wanna do that?

334
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,859
So you could tell yourself to do things different,

335
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,020
Save yourself a world of pain.

336
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,240
No, I needed that pain to get to where I am now.

337
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,950
I just got a nosebleed.

338
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,219
What? When?

339
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,650
Let's just not freak out the others, okay?

340
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,329
Just tell me...

341
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,509
Why--why her? Why me? I don't know.

342
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,499
Uh, I think it might have something to do

343
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,029
With duration of exposure.

344
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,029
You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island.

345
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,909
Doesn't make any sense.

346
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,889
Those yahoos have been here for months.

347
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,880
I've never been here before two weeks ago. Are you sure about that?

348
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,970
Hello?!

349
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,690
The camp's back.

350
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,429
Finally.

351
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,590
Anybody for a dharma beer?

352
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,419
Hello? Anybody here?

353
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,330
Rose? Bernard?

354
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,940
I wonder how long ago this happened.

355
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,070
Son of a bitch!

356
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,050
What is it?

357
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,499
It's vincent's.

358
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,939
Yeah? Well, where's the rest of the dog?

359
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,150
Where's the rest of our people?

360
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,869
The zodiac's gone, too.

361
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,189
Maybe your people took the boat.

362
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,240
Why the hell would they do that?

363
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,370
To get away from whoever came in those.

364
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,249
Where did these come from?

365
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,719
That's a good question.

366
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,249
They're pretty old.

367
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,900
Not that old.

368
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,060
Let me see that.

369
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,149
"adg-uh-ruh"?

370
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,179
Ajira. It's an airline.

371
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,139
It's based out of india, but they fly everywhere.

372
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,179
Great. Maybe they got a flight out of here to vegas tonight.

373
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,920
Who came in these? Other others? Don't look at me.

374
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,439
My question is, when are they coming back?

375
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,320
Let's not wait to find out.

376
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,379
This plan sounded a hell of a lot better

377
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,540
When we were going by motorboat.

378
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,619
How far is this place?

379
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,839
It's around that point. Not more than a couple hours.

380
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,590
Oh, joy.

381
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,490
You all right?

382
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,039
I saw kate.

383
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,099
What?

384
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,730
Last night, in the jungle.

385
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,670
Before the last flash.

386
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,470
She was delivering claire's baby.

387
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,300
But that was two months ago.

388
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,609
Time travel's a bitch.

389
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,170
Get down!

390
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,820
Paddle!

391
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,540
I think they want their boat back! Move!

392
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,139
These your people?! No! Are they yours?!

393
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,070
Shut up and keeping paddling!

394
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,810
Little help! Little help!

395
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,880
Paddle harder! They're getting closer!

396
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,960
Thank you, lord!

397
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,059
I take that back!

398
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,430
Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore!

399
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,849
Kate, just because the guy

400
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,889
Told you that he was meeting his client

401
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,339
Doesn't mean that they're here in l.A.

402
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,369
He could've just told you that to--to throw

403
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,660
You off. Or they're in that hotel right now

404
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,509
Okay. And what if they are?

405
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,019
What if the person who wants to take aaron

406
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,010
Is sitting in that hotel room right now?

407
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,660
Then what?

408
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,849
Come on. Come with me.

409
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,559
We'll--we'll go get aaron,

410
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,580
We'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out.

411
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,770
All right.

412
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,610
Oh, my god.

413
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,450
It's claire's mother.

414
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,069
Wait.

415
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,109
What am I waiting for, jack? Wait. I just...

416
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,329
Let's just think about this for a minute. She knows.

417
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,389
Maybe she doesn't know. No,

418
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,000
But she knows about aaron, and that's all that matters

419
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,689
Let me go talk to her.

420
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,529
What?

421
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,829
If I can just explain to her why we did it--

422
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,870
Maybe if I can get her to understand why...

423
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,190
She'll listen to me.

424
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,360
I can fix this, kate. I can fix it.

425
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,980
Aaron is my family, too.

426
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,659
Dr. Shephard?

427
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,209
Hello, ms. Littleton. Um...

428
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,739
May I come in?

429
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,570
Of course.

430
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,349
You look drenched.

431
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,389
No, no. No, I'm fine.

432
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,830
God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral.

433
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,980
How did you even know I was here?

434
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,480
I knew you were here, ms. Littleton,

435
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,360
Because I followed your lawyer.

436
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,599
Why would you do that?

437
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,719
I'm--i did it because, um...

438
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,539
I understand that you feel the need to do this.

439
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,899
But I need you to know

440
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,410
That everything that kate and I have done--it was for aaron.

441
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,980
Who's... Aaron?

442
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,979
I-i'm afraid I'm not following you.

443
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,360
Ms. Littleton, um...

444
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,660
What are you doing here in los angeles?

445
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,569
Let's go. Drive. Then call sun

446
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,739
And tell her to bring aaron to the long beach marina.

447
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,529
We'll meet her there. What--wh-what are you talking about? What happened?

448
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,419
Kate, we have to go now.

449
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,179
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what just happened

450
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,940
She doesn't know anything.

451
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,589
What?

452
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,419
She doesn't know.

453
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,160
She still thinks that claire is dead.

454
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,999
She doesn't even know that aaron exists.

455
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,619
But the lawyer-- she sued oceanic,

456
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,779
And she's in town to pick up her settlement.

457
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,019
What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawye

458
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,850
Happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son? I don't know.

459
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,240
But whoever's trying to take aaron...

460
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,530
It's not her.

461
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,050
Then who is it?

462
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,770
Can I ask you something?

463
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,090
Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue hugo?

464
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,360
I had to make sure hurley was safe.

465
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,730
You can pull in over here.

466
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,659
Mr. Linus.

467
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,320
Mr. Norton.

468
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,329
I looked into it,

469
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,889
And they don't have any kind of solid case against reyes.

470
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,849
The m.E. Said that the man found outside santa rosa

471
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,729
Was killed before reyes escaped.

472
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,989
That's very good news.

473
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,359
We have a prelim hearing in the morning.

474
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,839
The judge will never let it get past that,

475
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,310
And reyes will be a free man.

476
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,249
Thank you, dan.

477
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,940
Anytime.

478
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,060
Who was that?

479
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,250
That's my lawyer.

480
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,250
Remind me never to do that again.

481
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,790
Where are we? It's hard to say till it gets light.

482
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,309
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation.

483
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,120
What conversation was that?

484
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,109
The one before they started shooting at us,

485
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,550
Where you were about to tell me how it felt to see kate again.

486
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,610
I wasn't about to tell you anything.

487
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,050
Why don't you tell me now?

488
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,430
I was close enough to touch her.

489
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,220
If I wanted to, I could've...

490
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,020
Stood right up and talked to her.

491
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,470
Why didn't you?

492
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,680
What's done is done.

493
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,460
Juliet?

494
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,530
What's wrong?

495
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,010
Come and look at this!

496
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,109
It's wreckage.

497
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,990
Looks like it just happened.

498
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,800
Anybody speak french?

499
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,040
Jack, why did you call me today?

500
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,539
I told you. I was...

501
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,069
I was worried.

502
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,550
But why? Why were you worried? Why today?

503
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,529
I don't...

504
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,799
Right before I called you, sayid was attacked.

505
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,029
And the guy that did it-- your address was in his pocket.

506
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,560
Sayid? What's he doing here?

507
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,749
That's not important right now.

508
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,480
What matters is that we get you and aaron someplace safe.

509
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,460
Safe from who?

510
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,690
Hello, kate.

511
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,740
It's okay. He's with me.

512
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,889
He's with you?

513
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,479
I know this is gonna be hard to understand,

514
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,370
But he's here to help us.

515
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,530
To help everyone that we left behind.

516
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,380
We all need to be together again. It's him.

517
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,270
What?

518
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,649
It's him. He's the one who's trying to take aaron.

519
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,040
No. No. You-- you don't understand. No, jack. She's right.

520
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,480
It was me.

521
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,700
Sorry.

522
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,379
Who the hell do you think you are?

523
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,019
Why don't you just stay away?!

524
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,249
Why don't you leave me and my son alone?!

525
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,930
Because he's not your son, kate.

526
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,199
No understand.

527
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,730
You speak english?

528
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,820
Little.

529
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,780
Are you okay?

530
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,920
Yes.

531
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,550
How did you get here?

532
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,480
Boat. Qui est-ce?

533
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,000
What boat?

534
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,990
It's gone.

535
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,720
Sink.

536
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,589
It must've been caught in the same storm as ours.

537
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,369
Who are you? How long you in the water?

538
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,889
I don't know. How do you not know

539
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,360
How you wound up in the middle of the ocean, ah?

540
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,790
Merci, robert.

541
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,050
Thank you.

542
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,180
What is your name?

543
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,360
Kwon jin.

544
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,990
Jin.

545
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,670
Hello, jin.

546
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,450
