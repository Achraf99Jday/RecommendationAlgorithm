1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,160
Previously on Lost... 

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,100
Hello, Ben.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,700
- You're alive.  - Yes, I am.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,800
- Are you saying you know how to find them? How to find Jin?  - I have some ideas.

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,460
So you knew

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,560
this would happen to Locke if we brought him back here?

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,300
Dead is dead.

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,760
You don't get to come back from that.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,260
The Dharma folks at the swan work site...

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,730
They're gonna drill into the ground

11
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,700
and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy, 

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,760
and that will cause your plane... Oceanic 815...

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,560
To crash on this island.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,260
I think I can negate that energy.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,630
If I can, then that hatch will never be built, 

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,500
and your plane will land just like it's supposed to.

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,630
And just how exactly do you plan on destroying this energy?

18
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Where's the bomb, Richard? Where is it?

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,830
The hydrogen bomb that I told your people to bury.

21
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,500
Where is it?

22
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,200
Listen to me. Lower your gun, and we'll talk. Okay?

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,660
Nobody has to get hurt here. Just put the gun down.

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,630
I'm gonna give you three seconds.

25
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,530
- One...  - Don't do this.

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,460
What's he doing down there?

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,800
Jack, he's crazy. Is he?

28
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,600
What if this is why we're here?

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,230
What if this is our one chance

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,160
to put things back the way they're supposed to be?

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,130
- No.  - What the hell do you think you're doing?!

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,630
- They shot him! I'm gonna go help.  - Yeah, they're gonna shoot you, too.

33
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,230
We have to go, Jack. We have to go now.

34
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,860
- Jack!  - Don't you move!

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,460
Don't move.

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,730
Hey!

37
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,030
Just who the bloody hell might you be?

38
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,800
Eloise!

39
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,830
What happened?

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,060
This man walked into camp and put a gun to my head, 

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,300
and Eloise... Reacted. Where'd you find them?

42
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,660
Crouched in the bushes... Like rats.

43
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,830
Did you two come here with this man?

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,330
Yes.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,630
Put them in my tent.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,830
Would you care to tell me, Eloise, 

47
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,300
Why the Dharma Initiative seems to have declared war on us?

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:15,730
These people aren't from the Dharma Initiative, Charles.

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,200
Then where the hell are they from?

50
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,100
Richard, he's here.

51
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,030
I brought dinner.

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,430
John?

53
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,430
Hello, Richard.

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,260
It's been a while.

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,130
it's... it's been, uh, three years.

56
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,460
What happened? What... Where... Where were you?

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,030
I'll explain on the way.

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,930
On the way where?

59
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,930
It's gonna be night soon.

60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,330
You and I have an errand to run, and we don't have a lot of time.

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
What's wrong?

62
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,200
Something different about you.

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,630
I have a purpose now.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,360
What's he doing here?

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,530
He helped me get back.

66
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,960
Why did Locke say these were his people?

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
I thought they were yours.

68
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,700
When I left the island, John stepped in.

69
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,360
He's the leader now.

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Who's that man he's talking to?

71
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,160
His name is Richard Alpert.

72
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,200
He's a kind of...

73
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,800
Advisor.

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,300
And he has had that job for a very very long time.

75
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Sun? What are you...

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,060
Were you here in 1977?

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,030
Excuse me?

78
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,000
These people...

79
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,300
Jack Shephard, Kate Austen, Hugo Reyes.

80
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,600
They were here with my husband...

81
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,900
Jin Kwon.

82
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,800
Were you here?

83
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,130
Do you remember them? A... any of them?

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,200
Yes, I was here 30 years ago.

85
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,100
And I do. I remember these people.

86
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,060
I remember meeting them very clearly, because...

87
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,460
I watched them all die.

88
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,930
Drink of water?

89
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,530
Do you think it's true?

90
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,230
They're all dead?

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,430
I don't think we went through all this for nothing, Sun.

92
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,730
I'm ready, John.

93
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,960
You still have that compass I gave you?

94
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,730
A little rusty, but she can still find north.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,630
Ben, I'd appreciate it if you'd join us.

96
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:26,260
What, John, don't you trust me here with my former people?

97
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,230
Afraid I'll stage a coup?

98
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm not afraid of anything you can do anymore, Ben.

99
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
Well, in that case, I'd love to come.

100
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,230
Good.

101
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
Stay here we'll be back in a coupe of hours.

102
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,260
I'll see what I can find out.

103
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,660
But whatever happens, Sun, you have my words.

104
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,660
If there's a way for you and Jin to be together again, 

105
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,960
if there's a way to save our people...

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,660
I'll find it.

107
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,160
Take it easy on her.

108
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,200
Don't talk.

109
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,030
Understand?

110
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,130
Are you okay?

111
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,960
yeah.

112
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,700
You know, before we were caught...

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,960
You said that we needed

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,630
to put things back the way they were supposed to be.

115
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
What did you mean by that?

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,460
If we can do what Faraday said...

117
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,200
Our plane never crashes...

118
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,730
Flight 815 lands in Los Angeles.

119
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,860
And everyone we lost since we got here...

120
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,660
They'd all be alive.

121
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,830
And what about us?

122
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,530
We just...

123
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,530
Go on living our life

124
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,800
Because we've never met?

125
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,260
All the misery that we've been through...

126
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,800
We'd just wipe it clean. Never happened.

127
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,730
It was not all misery.

128
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,430
Enough of it was.

129
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,800
The man I shot...

130
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,360
What did he need the bomb for?

131
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,230
I need you to tell me why he wanted the bomb.

132
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,760
I don't think you'd believe me if I did.

133
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,160
When I was 17 years old, 

134
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,460
I took a young man to the bomb.

135
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,460
He proceeded to tell me that if we buried it underground, 

136
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,730
then things would work out splendidly.

137
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,300
When I asked him how he could be so sure...

138
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,930
he said that he was from the future.

139
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,360
And then he disappeared, 

140
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,960
right in front of my bloody eyes.

141
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,760
Ten minutes ago, 

142
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,900
I shot that man in the back.

143
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,700
And before he... died...

144
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,900
he told me that he...

145
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:49,430
he said he was my son.

146
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,100
Explain to me...

147
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,430
and you have my word I will believe you.

148
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,600
How is this my handwriting if I don't remember writing it?

149
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,330
Because you haven't written it yet.

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,360
I know this is hard to understand, 

151
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,930
but...

152
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,100
what you just did...

153
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,930
it was an accident, 

154
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,330
and I think that there's a way for you to take it all back.

155
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,530
What?

156
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,530
Your son came back here

157
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,560
because he had figured out a way to change things.

158
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,560
He doesn't have to be dead.

159
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,760
You don't have to have killed him.

160
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,030
If we do what's written in that journal...

161
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,200
none of this will have happened.

162
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,730
Does he know what he's talking about?

163
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,500
He thinks he does.

164
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,060
All right then, I'll take you to the bomb.

165
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,930
Just...

166
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,100
one small issue however.

167
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,860
We secured it over 20 years ago underground.

168
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,700
But since that time, 

169
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,730
it appears that someone's but an entire village over it.

170
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,660
The Dharma Initiative?

171
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,760
However...

172
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,800
it appears that you two

173
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,000
have been passing yourselves off as members, so...

174
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,400
I suppose coming and going will be relatively simple.

175
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,100
Ah, it might be a little bit more complicated than that.

176
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,860
That woman... where is she now?

177
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,930
Call my lawyer.

178
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,660
Stuart! What the hell are you doing?

179
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,930
I'm getting answers. Where is she?!

180
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,260
Hey. Hey! Stop! Damn it, stop.

181
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,260
That isn't order, I'm still in charge.

182
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,500
No, you were in charge, Horace.

183
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,500
But if we're gonna protect our people

184
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,660
and all the work we're doing here, 

185
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,960
you don't have the stomach for what happens next.

186
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,400
Phil.

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
Okay, Jim, last chance.

188
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,160
You tell me where she is...

189
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,360
or so help me god, I will kill you.

190
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,330
Hey!

191
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,930
You ready to talk now?

192
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
Nope.

193
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,030
Believe me, I'm gettin' tired of this too, Jim.

194
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,960
So why don't you tell me

195
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,200
where your girlfriend took the boy?

196
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,160
She bring him to the hostiles?

197
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,560
You know where they are?

198
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,230
Aah! Stop!

199
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,160
- Please!  - You want me to stop?

200
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,130
Then tell me what I want to know!

201
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,730
Stuart, please.

202
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,360
We have known each other for three years.

203
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,530
We are not bad people! We are not here to hurt you!

204
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,330
Juliet...

205
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,900
Don't.

206
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,960
Whatever you tell 'em, 

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,330
they ain't gonna believe you.

208
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,330
It's only gonna get more people hurt.

209
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,700
What are we doing, man?

210
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,900
Beating him is pointless. Okay? He's not gonna talk.

211
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,160
I can make him talk.

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,700
Son of a bitch!

213
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,500
Easy. Easy.

214
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,460
You're a dead man, Phil.

215
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm gonna kill you.

216
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,060
Mr. Radzinsky?

217
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,430
There's still no sign of Miles or Jin.

218
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,430
But the recruits from last week...

219
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,600
I got their sub's manifest from Amy.

220
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,560
There were three last-minute add-ons.

221
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,100
They were the two people that shot at you...

222
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,530
Shephard and Austen... and one guy we can't track down.

223
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
He's gotta be a part of this.

224
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,960
Who the hell is Hugo Reyes?

225
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,160
He's the fat guy.

226
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,530
So what's the rescue plan?

227
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Rescue plan? We're heading to the beach.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,500
- Why do you think we sent you for food?  - But they got Sawyer and Juliet.

229
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,460
And there are 30 of them, and they all have guns.

230
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
- The only people we can rescue is our ourselves, so let's go.  - We gotta do something.

231
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,130
I mean, Sawyer would never leave us behind.

232
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,000
Dr. Chang? What are you doing here?

233
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,330
I could ask you the same question.

234
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,100
But we asked you first.

235
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,960
Your friend Faraday

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,400
said that you were from the future.

237
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,430
I need to know if he was telling the truth.

238
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,460
Dude, that's ridiculous.

239
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
What year were you born?

240
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,430
What year?

241
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,760
Uh... 1931?

242
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,160
You're 46?

243
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Yeah.

244
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Yes, I am.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
So you fought in the Korean war?

246
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,500
There's no such thing.

247
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,030
Who's the president of the United States?

248
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,360
All right, dude, we're from the future. Sorry.

249
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,960
It's true then?

250
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,130
You are my son?

251
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,760
Yeah, it's true.

252
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,100
Your friend... the physicist...

253
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,030
He also told me to evacuate everyone I could off the island.

254
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,960
He said there was going to be a massive accident at the Swan.

255
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,730
Now is that true?

256
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,100
He's been right about everything so far.

257
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,030
If Faraday said get people off the island...

258
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,930
I'd do it.

259
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,730
Well, then let's hope he knows what he's doing.

260
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,800
Tell me something.

261
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,600
Why is it that this man looks...

262
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,300
familiar to me?

263
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,130
Richard...

264
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,030
You and Erik are coming with me.

265
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,030
Going with you where?

266
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,660
You can untie them.

267
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,460
And...

268
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,660
would you mind giving us a moment?

269
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,960
I'm taking them to the bomb.

270
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
What?

271
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,800
Are you insane?

272
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,700
I'm worried about you.

273
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,700
Not in your condition.

274
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,700
I mean it.

275
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,960
Who is he?

276
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,130
The man you're asking about, Jack, is Charles Widmore.

277
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,360
He and Eloise are...

278
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,660
well, let's just say love can be complicated.

279
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,860
All right. Let's move out.

280
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,960
So, John...

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,460
you, uh, you ready to tell

282
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,530
where you've been the last three years?

283
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,230
You really don't know?

284
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,730
Well, I know that on the day that Ben here turned the wheel, 

285
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,630
that you and I were sitting on a log.

286
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,260
There was a bright light. There was a loud noise, 

287
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,730
And then you just... you disappeared.

288
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,060
Well, Richard, you're just about to see where I disappeared to.

289
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,060
And after we're finished with that, 

290
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,000
I'd like you to take me to see Jacob.

291
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,930
That's... not how it works, John.

292
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Is that true, Richard? Is this gonna be a problem?

293
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,530
You just got back, John.

294
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,300
There's no reason to rush into...

295
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,800
I am the leader now. Right?

296
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, John. That's right.

297
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:46,700
Good. Then I would like you to take me to Jacob.

298
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,830
- Can you do that?  - Yeah, of course.

299
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,630
Fantastic.

300
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,100
Let's keep moving. We're almost to the plane.

301
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,030
What plane?

302
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
It's a Beechcraft... used to smuggle heroin.

303
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,460
Flew out of Nigeria, crashed here.

304
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,260
All right, Richard, listen very carefully.

305
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,430
Because you're only gonna have about three minutes

306
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,400
- to get this right.  - Get what right?

307
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,360
A man's about to walk out of the jungle.

308
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,900
He's been shot in the leg.

309
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,360
You'll need this to get the bullet out.

310
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,230
Uh, I'm sorry, John. I'm not...

311
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,760
Now just listen. This is the important part.

312
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,760
You're gonna need to tell him

313
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,160
that he has to bring everyone who left back to the island.

314
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,530
And when he asks how to do that...

315
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,060
You tell him he's gonna have to die.

316
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,800
Who is that man, John?

317
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,060
Me.

318
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,500
Aah!

319
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,100
Richard?

320
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,360
Richard...

321
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,000
What is happening?

322
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,930
What's happening is that you're bleeding to death.

323
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,730
Okay, here.

324
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,760
I need to get the bullet out.

325
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,000
How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?

326
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,900
Because you told me there was, John. 

327
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,000
No, no. No, I didn't.

328
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,460
Well... You will.

329
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,360
This must be quite the out-of-body experience.

330
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,660
Something like that.

331
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,630
Your timing was impeccable, John.

332
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,800
How did you know when to be here?

333
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,460
The island told me.

334
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,930
Didn't it ever tell you things?

335
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,360
No, John. And clearly it hasn't told you where Jacob is, 

336
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,930
or you wouldn't need Richard to show you. You've never seen him.

337
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,130
What?

338
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,260
Jacob. You've never seen him, have you?

339
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,130
What just happened?

340
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,600
Where did you go?

341
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,260
To give richard his compass back.

342
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,430
You want the bullet?

343
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,930
Keep it.

344
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,660
Everything go all right?

345
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, you seemed pretty convinced, 

346
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,430
especially when I said you were gonna die.

347
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,860
I'm certainly glad that didn't have to happen.

348
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,100
Actually, Richard, it did.

349
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,960
We better get back to camp.

350
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,000
You need to evacuate the island of all nonessential personnel, 

351
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,860
and you need to do it...

352
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,830
What the hell is going on here?

353
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,600
Aren't you supposed to be at the Swan right now, Chang?

354
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,660
- We're supposed to break ground in less than 20 hours.  - We're under imminent threat.

355
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,330
If we start drilling, 

356
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,460
there's a high probability of a cataclysmic accident.

357
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,930
We are drilling and on schedule.

358
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,630
- Horace, you're in charge.  - He's not in charge anymore.

359
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,360
This is my decision, and it's been made.

360
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,800
- We keep working.  - Put us on the sub.

361
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,860
He's right. It aren't safe.

362
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,300
Put the women and children on the sub

363
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,800
and get them the hell out of here.

364
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,730
And if you put me and Juliet on the sub with them...

365
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,200
We'll tell you anything you wanna know.

366
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,560
You okay with that, sweetheart?

367
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,230
Absolutely.

368
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,900
You want on that sub, Jim?

369
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,060
Draw me a map.

370
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,600
I wanna know exactly where the hostiles are.

371
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,230
You two know how to swim?

372
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,730
Why don't we just go aund it?

373
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,200
No, dear, we need to go in.

374
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,300
We have to swim under the pond to get to the tunnels.

375
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,630
I'm not going.

376
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,030
What?

377
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,960
I'm gonna go back and find everyone else. I...

378
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,930
I can't go any further with you, Jack. Not this time.

379
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,930
Kate, you can't go back there now. They know about us.

380
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,100
They... they tried to kill us.

381
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,360
And what are you trying to do?

382
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,830
Bye, Jack.

383
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,660
You're not going anywhere.

384
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,300
- No, you don't need to do that.  - We're not in the habit of telling our secrets

385
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,130
- to strangers, then just letting them saunter off.  - You know, I don't care I just wanna leave.

386
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,730
- Look, just put the gun...  - Step away!

387
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,560
- Hey! I said stop!  - If she wants to leave, she can leave!

388
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,400
What are we doing here, Eloise?

389
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,360
That man just killed one of our own people, 

390
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,300
and you're acting like it doesn't matter.

391
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,260
If these people are right

392
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,000
about what they're about to do, Richard, it won't matter.

393
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,760
And what are they about to do?

394
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,400
So you're telling me

395
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,030
you're going to erase the last three years of our lives?

396
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,700
- We can change things, Sayid.  - I don't know if you're aware of this, 

397
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,630
But I've already changed things.

398
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,930
I killed Benjamin Linus, 

399
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,830
- And we're all still here.  - It's because you didn't kill him.

400
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,230
Sawyer and me took him to the others.

401
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,630
So that they could save him.

402
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,530
Why did you do that?

403
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,500
Why did I do that?

404
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,400
Since when did shooting kids and blowing up hydrogen bombs

405
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,060
become okay?

406
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,830
The three of us disappeared off that plan and ended up here, 

407
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,200
Ended up now, because this is our chance to change things.

408
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,400
And if you're wrong, then everyone on the island dies.

409
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,360
Do you understand that?

410
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,760
I'm not wrong, Kate. This is it. This is why we're here.

411
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,400
This is our destiny.

412
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,030
Do you know who you sound like?

413
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:38,200
Because he was crazy, too, Jack. You said so yourself.

414
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,160
Well, maybe I was wrong.

415
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,300
No, you were right.

416
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,430
I'm going back to find the rest of our people, 

417
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,260
Because if I can't stop you, then maybe they can.

418
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,900
The submarine departs in 30 minutes.

419
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,400
All evacuees, please proceed to the dock.

420
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,860
come now, charlotte. Stay with me.

421
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,160
This is ridiculous. I can help you.

422
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,860
No, Lara, you can't. Just go over there.

423
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,130
I want you to leave now! 

424
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,430
Why is he yelling at her, dude?

425
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,900
It's the only way he can get her to leave.

426
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,760
Sorry, man.

427
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,200
We'd better get going.

428
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,630
Wait! Whoa! Whoa! Wait... wait a second.

429
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,730
It's Jim and Juliet.

430
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,430
Why the hell are they¡­

431
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
Putting them on the sub?

432
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,260
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

433
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Sawyer always has a plan, right?

434
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,060
We'll buy Microsoft.

435
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,000
Excuse me?

436
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,460
Then we'll bet the cowboys in the '78 super bowl.

437
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,800
We're gonna be rich.

438
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,560
Look, I'm sorry.

439
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I should've listed to you

440
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,560
When you wanted to get on this sub three years ago.

441
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm glad you talked me out of it.

442
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,760
Come on, Lafleur. Get in.

443
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,600
Ladies first.

444
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,930
Good riddance.

445
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,700
If I don't see you the other side, 

446
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,460
I won't blame you.

447
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,200
Now take a deep breath and follow Richard under.

448
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,230
There's an opening in the bottom of the rocks at the far side.

449
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,260
That was a lot further than I thought it was.

450
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,260
Where are we?

451
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,000
The tunnels.

452
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,430
You wanna tell me how we're gonna get a bomb out of here?

453
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,860
The same way we brought it in.

454
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,300
I assume you don't mean through the pool.

455
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,730
It's a 12-foot long, 40, 000-pound hydrogen bomb.

456
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,700
No, not through the pool.

457
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,160
I didn't think you'd come.

458
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,130
Well, if this works, you might just save us all.

459
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,900
And if it doesn't, at least you'll put us out of our misery.

460
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,130
All right. Let's get started.

461
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,600
I'll have a tent prepared for you, John.

462
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,630
We'll get going first thing in the morning.

463
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,600
I thought we could leave right now.

464
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,430
Now?

465
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,500
I'm eager.

466
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,600
We can do whatever you want, but maybe the two of us

467
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,560
- Should go to my tent and talk about...  - Is this everyone?

468
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,560
Well, there's another group at the temple, but...

469
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,530
Well, if you don't mind, 

470
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,860
I would like to talk to everyone here now.

471
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,230
Of course. Be my guest.

472
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,960
Hello, everyone.

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,300
My name is John Locke.

474
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,260
I've been told that...

475
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,260
for some time, 

476
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,460
You all have been accepting orders from a man named Jacob.

477
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,400
And yet, oddly enough, 

478
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,660
It seems that no one has actually seen him.

479
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,130
Now I'm sure there are very good reasons

480
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,130
Why his existence and whereabouts are secret.

481
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,500
I just don't know what they are.

482
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,660
And to be honest with all of you, 

483
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,200
If there's a man telling us what to do, 

484
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:16,100
I want to know who he is.

485
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,100
This man...Jacob? Can he tell us

486
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,100
How to bring Jin and the rest of our people back here?

487
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,560
Absolutely.

488
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,960
Richard has agreed to show us where we need to go.

489
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,500
So I'm gonna go and see Jacob right now.

490
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,960
And I'd like all of you to come with me.

491
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,900
I'm starting to think John Locke is gonna be a trouble.

492
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,760
Why do you think I tried to kill him?

493
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,700
We're shovin' off in two minutes.

494
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,100
Appreciate it if you didn't cause us any trouble.

495
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,060
Wouldn't think of it, Nemo.

496
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,100
What are we gonna do on we get to Ann Arbor?

497
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,960
We ain't going to Ann Arbor.

498
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,700
- What do you mean?  - These guys ain't cops.

499
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,130
They got no authority over us back in the real world

500
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,800
So once we dock wherever we dock...

501
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,430
We're free.

502
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,260
"real world."

503
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,960
I don't even know what that means anymore.

504
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Hey, come here.

505
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,430
Whatever happens, I got you back, remember?

506
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,900
I love you.

507
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,530
I love you back.

508
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,600
Hold on! Don't close the hatch!

509
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,030
Horace wants her off the island, too.

510
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,300
We'll let Ann Arbor deal with them. 

511
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,560
Actually caught her coming back into town.

512
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,230
Cuff her over there with the others.

513
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,060
Hey. 

514
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,500
Hey.

515
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,100
Clear the bridge.

516
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,160
All personnel lay below on the double.

517
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,300
We're away. Engineering, take your stations.

518
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,630
Boat is clear for sea.

519
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,100
All men to your stations. Prepare to dive.

520
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,060
Clear the bridge. All hands below. 

521
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,700
Stand by main vents.

522
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,200
Diving position.

523
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,360
Stand by on ballast tanks. Ship has been cleared for dive.

524
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,500
Repeat, ship has been cleared for dive. Stand by for dive.

525
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,130
Ship to dive.

526
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,200
Clear engines two and three. Test two and three.

527
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,960
Jack.

528
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,630
I'm sure it's occurred to you

529
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,630
That this woman's motivation

530
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,930
In helping us detonate a hydrogen bomb

531
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,400
is only to annihilate the Dharma Initiative.

532
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,760
- Yes, but I still trust her.  - Why?

533
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,100
Because 30 years from now, she's the one

534
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,060
Who's gonna tell us how to get back to the island.

535
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,460
And that makes you trust her?

536
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,300
Well...

537
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,630
Now what?

538
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,100
Beautiful day, isn't it?

539
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,130
Yes... so far.

540
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,130
Richard had some concerns.

541
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,130
Concerns about what?

542
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,030
This pilgrimage to Jacob makes him uncomfortable.

543
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,560
He's expressed...

544
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,560
Reservations about whether or not

545
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
You know what the hell you're doing.

546
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,230
I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, Ben.

547
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,930
I know we've had our differences in the past, John, 

548
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,430
But I'm here to follow you now.

549
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,430
So if you need Jacob to help you reunite your people, 

550
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,900
- Then I'll do whatever...  - I'm not interested in being reunited with my people.

551
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,960
- What do you mean? You told Sun...  - I know what I told her, 

552
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,200
But that's not why we're going to Jacob.

553
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,700
Then why are we going to Jacob?

554
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,800
So I can kill him.
