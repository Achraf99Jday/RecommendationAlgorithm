1
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,143
>> Jimmy: There you go.

2
00:00:22,431 --> 00:00:23,575
It's over with.

3
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:27,023
This guy was crying the whole

4
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:27,934
Time.

5
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,159
I really am embarrassed for him.

6
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,102
Well, "lost" is done.

7
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,670
I don't know what we have left.

8
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,614
I really don't.

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,430
Tonight the cast is here to

10
00:00:35,575 --> 00:00:38,215
Reflect, to dissect and to

11
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:39,695
Hopefully answer the question

12
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:40,870
That I think is on everyone's

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,598
Mind right now -- what the hell

14
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:43,734
Just happened?

15
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:50,891
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

16
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:57,045
>> announcer: Tonight, Jimmy

17
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:00,548
Kimmel hosts the cast of "lost."

18
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,308
Brought to you by bud light.

19
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:14,551
>> Jimmy: Thank you.

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,367
"lost" crash landed in our

21
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:20,208
Living rooms with a story about

22
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:22,975
Love, death, good, evil, time

23
00:01:23,254 --> 00:01:24,832
Travel, polar bears and fried

24
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,528
Chicken.

25
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:27,000
And if you're expecting it all

26
00:01:27,152 --> 00:01:28,159
To get wrapped up tonight,

27
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:29,327
You're probably missing the

28
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,047
Point of the show.

29
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:31,431
Two things I think we learned

30
00:01:31,503 --> 00:01:32,519
For sure though.

31
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,311
Number one, don't go chasing

32
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:35,615
Waterfalls.

33
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:38,382
And number two, all dogs don't

34
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:39,927
Necessarily go to heaven.

35
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:41,918
All right.

36
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:43,711
Well, let's -- where better to

37
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,094
Begin than with the guy who

38
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,054
Began it all and with whom it

39
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:49,607
Ended too, Dr. Jack Shepherd?

40
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,193
Please welcome Matthew fox,

41
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,160
Everybody.

42
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,063
I'm so happy to see you alive

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,775
Right now, I really am.

44
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:22,080
So that was the first time you'd

45
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:23,196
Seen the ending, right?

46
00:02:23,422 --> 00:02:24,175
>> that was the first time,

47
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:24,735
Yeah.

48
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:25,647
Just sitting backstage.

49
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:27,607
It's pretty moving.

50
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:28,607
Yeah.

51
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:29,855
>> Jimmy: You feel a little bit

52
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:31,311
Like Tom Sawyer looking in on

53
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,383
Your own funeral?

54
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,448
Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

55
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,935
It's hard to watch for me.

56
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,231
But sometime down the road I

57
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,631
Suppose I'll go back and watch

58
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:40,903
It all the way through.

59
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:41,879
>> Jimmy: Your neck has healed

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Up.

61
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:43,447
That's good news.

62
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:44,823
>> yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:46,671
>> Jimmy: I want to present you,

64
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,376
If I could, with my theory on

65
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,230
What happened.

66
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:50,792
Okay?

67
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:54,382
In a lot of religions,

68
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,080
Christianity being one of them,

69
00:02:56,168 --> 00:02:58,391
The idea is life is a test.

70
00:02:58,487 --> 00:03:00,111
That you go through your life

71
00:03:00,248 --> 00:03:02,047
And if you're good, you go to

72
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:04,263
Heaven or nirvana or whatever.

73
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,391
And if you're bad, you don't,

74
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:07,792
You go to hell or you don't go

75
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:08,567
Anywhere.

76
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:10,631
My theory is that the whole show

77
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,967
From beginning to end, we're

78
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,863
Watching Jack's test.

79
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:15,000
His test.

80
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,111
And his life on the island I

81
00:03:18,184 --> 00:03:20,527
Think was his real life.

82
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,327
>> yes.

83
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,416
>> Jimmy: You think --

84
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,743
>> I completely agree with that.

85
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:24,551
>> Jimmy: I'm on a roll.

86
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,351
>> yep, yep.

87
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,311
>> Jimmy: Obviously, Jack passed

88
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,359
The test.

89
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:29,063
>> yes.

90
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:29,759
>> Jimmy: And maybe the

91
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:30,607
Characters -- maybe each of the

92
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,352
Characters has their own story

93
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,639
And their own test.

94
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,704
But this show I think was Jack's

95
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:37,696
Test.

96
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:40,431
>> I would agree with that.

97
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:41,031
I mean --

98
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,455
>> Jimmy: I'm so proud of myself

99
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,911
Right now, you have no idea.

100
00:03:48,327 --> 00:03:49,432
>> but at the same time,

101
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,167
That's -- what's beautiful with

102
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,215
The way it ends is there's room

103
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:53,615
For interpretation depending on

104
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,007
People's spiritual beliefs.

105
00:03:55,103 --> 00:03:58,559
I think there are also religions

106
00:03:58,648 --> 00:03:59,959
That believe that when you die

107
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:03,151
You go to a place -- and that

108
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,368
Place can last for a nano second

109
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,680
Or it can be an extended period

110
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:06,583
Of time.

111
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,759
Where you have to remember your

112
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,839
Own death and all of the people

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,352
That were instrumental, that you

114
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,552
Loved the most and henn helped

115
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:14,967
The most and were the most

116
00:04:15,056 --> 00:04:16,196
Important to you.

117
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:17,455
You have to remember all of

118
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:18,223
Them.

119
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:19,736
And remembering them, lead up to

120
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,287
The moment you died, before you

121
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,687
Can move on to whatever's next.

122
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:23,656
>> Jimmy: I want to look at a

123
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,160
Clip from the first episode of

124
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:26,063
This srngs t

125
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,351
This season, the final season.

126
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:28,776
This is when you were on a plane

127
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,248
Again.

128
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:31,351
Take a look.

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,543
>> don't worry.

130
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:55,327
>> you got to go now.

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,302
It's okay, you can let go.

132
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:09,608
>> Jimmy: Now, I think what

133
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,272
Happened during that turbulence

134
00:05:11,392 --> 00:05:13,648
Is Jack died there.

135
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:17,560
And when the plane calmed down,

136
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,776
That's when you passed over, and

137
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:21,342
Maybe the whole island, the

138
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,647
Adventure, the journey, all that

139
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:23,792
Stuff happened in the nano

140
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,112
Second, as you said.

141
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:27,368
>> that's possible.

142
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:32,063
>> Jimmy: I have another theory

143
00:05:32,134 --> 00:05:32,919
I've been working on.

144
00:05:32,975 --> 00:05:35,007
Because Jack was with Kate and

145
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,568
Kate was with Sawyer and then

146
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:38,543
Jack was with Juliette and

147
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:39,912
Juliette was with Sawyer.

148
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,590
There's another thing I'm

149
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,609
Hedonism like tea party island.

150
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:44,834
All inclusive, of course.

151
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:45,689
You don't have to pay for

152
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,537
Anything extra.

153
00:05:46,673 --> 00:05:47,601
>> it was a little bit like

154
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:48,633
That, that's for sure.

155
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:50,089
>> Jimmy: Well, you told us and

156
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,282
You've said this a number of

157
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,506
Times, that you knew what the

158
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:54,738
Ending was at the beginning.

159
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,393
You knew what the ending to the

160
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,066
Show was.

161
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,667
Were you telling the truth?

162
00:05:58,889 --> 00:05:59,937
>> I knew the final image.

163
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,330
I knew the show would end with

164
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,625
His eye closing.

165
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,907
I knew that he would die.

166
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:08,193
And I just hoped beyond hope

167
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,202
That there would be redemption

168
00:06:09,274 --> 00:06:10,002
In that.

169
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,946
I believe there is.

170
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:14,761
You know, it's been an

171
00:06:14,857 --> 00:06:15,746
Incredible, incredible

172
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:16,769
Experience playing this guy.

173
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:18,297
Taken him the four years to

174
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:19,546
Where he becomes sort of a

175
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,538
Broken man and has deviated from

176
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,904
His destiny on the island.

177
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:26,226
And knows that he has to go back

178
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,498
Or he'll die.

179
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:30,250
And then start to embrace the

180
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:31,609
Notion that he has this thing to

181
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,673
Do on the island and that he's

182
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:33,809
Going to give his life in doing

183
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,073
It.

184
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:36,042
He starts to feel strong.

185
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:38,689
And has given over to the notion

186
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,825
That that's exactly whether he's

187
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,082
Meant to do.

188
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,465
And yeah.

189
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:44,866
So I always knew the show would

190
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:45,817
End with his eye closing.

191
00:06:46,513 --> 00:06:48,145
>> Jimmy: We got a lot of the

192
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:49,250
Gang here tonight.

193
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,187
Hey, can we just get one shot of

194
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,745
Your eye closing one more time?

195
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:55,826
>> no way.

196
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,824
>> Jimmy: We have quite an hour

197
00:06:58,993 --> 00:06:59,920
Planned for tonight.

198
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:00,991
Matthew fox is with us.

199
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:02,089
Much of the cast is with us.

200
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,479
We have the never before seen

201
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:04,991
Alternate endings to the show

202
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,560
With Damon Lindelof and Carlton

203
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:07,367
Cuse.

204
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:08,552
We'll be right back with Ben

205
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,152
Linus and Locke, Michael Emerson

206
00:07:10,224 --> 00:07:11,392
And Terry O'Quinn.

207
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,493
>> oh, hi!

208
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,060
I'm Stephen Colbert.

209
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,722
Congratulating "lost" on a great

210
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,660
Run.

211
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:30,204
Now, I've never seen lost.

212
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,796
But I was a huge fan of the

213
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,268
Series it was based on,

214
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:35,180
"Gilligan's island."

215
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,676
I have to say, in this new

216
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:38,380
Version, it was even harder to

217
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,556
Choose between ginger and m

218
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:41,869
Maryanne.

219
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,700
My only disappointment was the

220
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:46,396
Globetrotters never showed up.

221
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,085
Or did they?

222
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:53,028
Rewatch season three, episode

223
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,405
Seven very carefully.

224
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:58,629
Anyway, "lost," congratulations

225
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,324
On finally going off the air.

226
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,420
I got to say, I never saw that

227
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,516
Ending coming.

228
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,332
That j.J. Abrams is a genius.

229
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:09,845
>> announcer: Abc's "jimmy

Brought to you by bud light.

232
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,220
>> Jimmy: Matthew fox is with us

233
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,556
As we say "aloha to lost."

234
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,541

235

We're honored, by the way, to

00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:34,533
Have the great academy award

239
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:36,995
Winning composer with us

240
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:37,674
Tonight.

241
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:41,923
Sitting in with our band the

242
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:42,681
Cletones.

243
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:43,970
Every once in a while, will you

244
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,178
Do me a favor and give me one of

245
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:48,153
Those big "lost" blast noises?

246
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,073
Excellent.

247
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:57,738
Just work that in wherever it

248
00:08:58,066 --> 00:08:58,955
Feels right, you know what I'm

249
00:08:59,034 --> 00:08:59,689
Saying?

250
00:08:59,786 --> 00:09:00,554
>> you got it.

251
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:01,802
>> Jimmy: Together our next two

252
00:09:01,898 --> 00:09:03,098
Guests played four characters.

253
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,139
Ben Linus, Henry gill, John

254
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:06,634
Locke and the monster known as

255
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:07,482
Smoke.

256
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,857
Please welcome Michael Emerson

257
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,162
And Terry O'Quinn.

258
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,161
?

259
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:35,306
>> Jimmy: Welcome, thank you for

260
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:35,985
Coming.

261
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:42,985
By the way, all three of you are

262
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:44,658
Not nominated at the Emmys this

263
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,401
Year, that will be a travesty.

264
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:48,378
Right?

265
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:51,729
I'm looking for the horns kind

266
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,434
Of.

267
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:55,218
?

268
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,314
First of all, I want to --

269
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,873
Terry, is it good Terry or bad

270
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:02,578
Terry that we have here tonight?

271
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,738
>> it's out of work Terry

272
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:05,562
Tonight.

273
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:07,066
>> Jimmy: It's out of work

274
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,025
You guys both got to play good

275
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,945
Guys and bad guys kind of in the

276
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:15,018
Same guy.

277
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,130
You went back and forth a little

278
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:16,762
Bit.

279
00:10:16,986 --> 00:10:17,849
Michael, you went back and forth

280
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,114
I think twice in the last

281
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,146
Episode.

282
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,515
Not you of course but your

283
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:23,945
Character.

284
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,905
Is it more fun to play the --

285
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,769
?

286
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:29,266
>> nice.

287
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,306
>> Jimmy: More fun to play the

288
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:31,634
Smoke monster than it is to play

289
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:32,522
John Locke?

290
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,306
>> it's not more fun, it's just

291
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,034
Different.

292
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:36,353
You know, the writing has been

293
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,369
Consistently great, so I've had

294
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:40,361
Fun playing -- I had fun playing

295
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:41,209
Both of them.

296
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,281
>> I liked that when you were

297
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,273
Playing the smoke monster and

298
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,778
Didn't know you were playing it.

299
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,409
>> that was the best, yeah.

300
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,226
That was all of season five when

301
00:10:49,322 --> 00:10:50,465
I was the smoke monster and

302
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:51,289
Didn't know it.

303
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,146
>> Jimmy: You never know when

304
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,930
You're the smoke monster.

305
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:53,802
You really don't.

306
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:55,075
It just kind of sneaks up on

307
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:55,769
You.

308
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:56,826
>> it could be anybody.

309
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:57,658
It could happen to you.

310
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,586
>> Jimmy: I've heard that -- I

311
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,849
Heard that you guys were hoping

312
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:03,978
To do a show together after

313
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:04,546
This.

314
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:05,738
Is that true?

315
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:08,482
>> well, we joke around a lot on

316
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,761
The set and -- but a lot of

317
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,066
Times we try to think of what

318
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,426
Kind of goofy double act we

319
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,978
Could come up with, you know,

320
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:17,346
Later on in life.

321
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:19,634
But once in a while, we have

322
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,178
Kind of a half-clever idea.

323
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,634
And we're just pitching it

324
00:11:23,706 --> 00:11:25,170
Around on street corners and

325
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:25,834
Other places.

326
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:26,634
>> Jimmy: Are you, yeah?

327
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:27,410
>> trying to get something

328
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:28,322
Going.

329
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,898
>> I have -- it's fun, I've

330
00:11:30,026 --> 00:11:31,769
Loved working with Michael and I

331
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,322
Have said on many occasions I

332
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,690
Would like to again.

333
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,658
>> Jimmy: You should do "the

334
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:36,402
Amazing race" together.

335
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,601
That be with a great start.

336
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:44,843
If you do do a show together,

337
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,273
Can I pitch you something?

338
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,377
>> sure.

339
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,123
>> Jimmy: Okay.

340
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,219
Veg es magicians by night.

341
00:11:51,458 --> 00:11:53,818
Forensic police officers by

342
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:54,857
Later at night.

343
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,786
Because Vegas is -- you guys go

344
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:58,441
Around.

345
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,520
Somebody's killing show girls.

346
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,578
You guys have to go around

347
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:01,426
Solving crime.

348
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:03,249
One of you maybe plays it very

349
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,105
Straight.

350
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:04,962
By the book.

351
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,114
The other not so much.

352
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,273
Plays by his own rooms.

353
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:08,794
>> I think it's a great idea.

354
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:09,641
What do you guys --

355
00:12:11,962 --> 00:12:12,738
>> Jimmy: And we call it --

356
00:12:12,826 --> 00:12:13,554
>> which one would be the one

357
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:14,594
That didn't play by the rules?

358
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:15,531
>> Jimmy: Either one of you.

359
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:16,459
I think you could switch off

360
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,666
Who's playing by the rules and

361
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,131
Who's not playing by the rule.

362
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,083
>> could one have a foreign

363
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,050
Accent?

364
00:12:21,258 --> 00:12:22,290
>> Jimmy: Whatever you want to

365
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:23,075
Do.

366
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,810
You could be like Sig Freud and

367
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,561
Roy, both have foreign accents.

368
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,313
Somebody gets attacked by a

369
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:30,113
Tiger.

370
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:31,410
The other steps in.

371
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,113
It's called "cadaver ka dab Ra."

372
00:12:41,722 --> 00:12:42,994
>> some tights are so great that

373
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,338
No show could live up to the

374
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,218
Promise.

375
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,786
>> Jimmy: That could be one of

376
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,506
Those, absolutely.

377
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:51,874
You guys, really, the acting on

378
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:53,474
The show has been phenomenal.

379
00:12:53,554 --> 00:12:55,433
Some of the scenes tonight

380
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,281
Between Jack and Locke were just

381
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:00,857
Phenomenal.

382
00:13:00,937 --> 00:13:03,290
You guys -- do you goof around

383
00:13:03,386 --> 00:13:05,250
During that -- those scenes?

384
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,298
Or is it very serious?

385
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,586
>> I mean, we goof around quite

386
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,577
A bit.

387
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:12,329
Yeah.

388
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,353
There's a lot of light stuff in

389
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,098
Between that.

390
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,401
I mean -- right?

391
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,161
>> Jimmy: Are you thinking of

392
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:19,058
Something in particular?

393
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:20,433
>> no, somewhat.

394
00:13:20,555 --> 00:13:23,162
You know, Matthew's very

395
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:23,985
Professional.

396
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:26,042
Everybody on the show, truly,

397
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:31,498
Has come -- I mean, well, for

398
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,755
The most part, has come

399
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,209
Prepared.

400
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,378
>> Jimmy: Who's the least

401
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,698
Professional on the set?

402
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:39,873
>> well, Josh Holloway.

403
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:41,153
>> Jimmy: Josh Holloway.

404
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:45,898
>> is he here tonight?

405
00:13:45,986 --> 00:13:46,705
>> Jimmy: No.

406
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,554
>> he's not here?

407
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:48,386
>> Jimmy: He's not here.

408
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:49,091
>> Josh Holloway.

409
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:50,802
>> Jimmy: Very unprofessional.

410
00:13:51,612 --> 00:13:53,285
There have been many great

411
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,196
Scenes.

412
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,661
What hits you as the most

413
00:13:56,764 --> 00:13:58,220
Memorable for each of your

414
00:13:58,292 --> 00:13:59,172
Characters?

415
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:02,196
>> I still remember -- I can't

416
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,916
Forget in season one when we

417
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:06,324
Were shooting the first episode

418
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:07,364
That I was heavily involved in

419
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:08,732
That was called "walk about."

420
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:11,940
And actually in the shooting of

421
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,380
It, I still didn't know -- I had

422
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,548
No idea where we were going of

423
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,700
Course and I didn't know it was

424
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:16,389
Going to be strong.

425
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,572
When I watched it, it was when

426
00:14:17,644 --> 00:14:19,356
Locke wiggles his toes and

427
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:21,548
Stands up and the music --

428
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,092
That's when I realized what we

429
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:25,149
Had with Michael and with Jack.

430
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,244
That's when it all came together

431
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,053
For me.

432
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,963
I said, holy mackerel this could

433
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:29,876
Really be something.

434
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
>> Jimmy: How about you,

435
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:31,676
Michael?

436
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,676
>> I've had a lot of great

437
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:34,244
Scenes that involved food.

438
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,484
And there was one with cereal

439
00:14:37,564 --> 00:14:39,220
And there was one where I made

440
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:40,380
Dinner for Juliette.

441
00:14:40,484 --> 00:14:41,636
One I particularly remember, I

442
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:43,116
Was being held captive in an

443
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,579
Under water chamber and John

444
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:46,853
Locke brought me food and said

445
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,212
It was rabbit and I said, did

446
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:50,781
This have a number on it?

447
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:52,140
Which is one of those moments I

448
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,955
Knew I was in a comedy.

449
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:57,508
>> Jimmy: But no one else.

450
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,724
>> but no one else.

451
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,628
>> Jimmy: Matt, how about you,

452
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:02,244
What really sticks out for you?

453
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,981
>> there's so many.

454
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,133
It's hard to -- I think the

455
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:07,668
Very -- in the pilot, the scene

456
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:09,676
Where Kate is stitching up Jack

457
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:10,868
Was probably just the first

458
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,036
Time -- it was really -- it was

459
00:15:12,108 --> 00:15:13,331
A tough thing to do.

460
00:15:13,428 --> 00:15:14,485
>> Jimmy: Very "Rambo"-esque.

461
00:15:14,557 --> 00:15:16,005
>> it was amazing, he really

462
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:19,492
Gave me some great notes in that

463
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:21,845
Scene.

464
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:24,052
So that stands out.

465
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,411
That was a good one.

466
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,805
?

467
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:33,340
>> Jimmy: Not what I was

468
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:33,980
Expecting.

469
00:15:34,037 --> 00:15:35,203
That's the show for you.

470
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,459
Never what you're expecting.

471
00:15:36,597 --> 00:15:37,204
All right.

472
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,309
Well, we have a lot to come.

473
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:39,636
Executive producers Damon

474
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:40,708
Lindelof and Carlton cuse.

475
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:45,516
I got a nice drive shaft ring

476
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,324
From Michael.

477
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,035
Thank you, Michael, I think

478
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,875
We're engaged.

479
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,747
We'll be back with more.

480
00:15:48,844 --> 00:15:50,444
Our "aloha to lost."

481
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,667
>> this is h

482
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:02,724
>> this is how big a fan I am.

483
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,740
You know the woman, Widmore's

484
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:04,411
Wife?

485
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,325
I can't even keep up with that

486
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:07,332
Relationship.

487
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,069
She was at a Christmas party,

488
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:10,933
The white-haired woman.

489
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:13,732
I shrieked as I came around the

490
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:14,579
Corner.

491
00:16:14,627 --> 00:16:17,524
I looked that the woman.

492
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:20,029
Oh, God, and she takes me aside.

493
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,212
She goes, please don't do that.

494
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,786
>>> hello, everybody.

495
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:27,994
Sorry I couldn't be with you

496
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:28,666
Tonight.

497
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:30,922
I'm watching the action from the

498
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:32,801
Set of my new movie "snakes on

499
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,601
The plane 2 electric boogaloo."

500
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,473
It's about what happened when a

501
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:39,184
Bunch of deadly snakes attack a

502
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:40,458
Group of kids on the way to a

503
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:42,090
Break dancing competition.

504
00:16:42,706 --> 00:16:44,225
I play the Sam Jackson role.

505
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:46,418
And we're all very proud of it,

506
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:47,696
Right, guys?

507
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,834
>> right.

508
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:51,745
Any way, even though I have a

509
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,305
Great new family.

510
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,632
I do miss you guys and I wish I

511
00:16:58,714 --> 00:16:59,441
Could be there.

512
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,803
So I love you.

513
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,105
And remember, keep snaking!

514
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:06,641
?

515
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:15,345
>> Jimmy: Things are going well

516
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:16,313
For Josh I guess.

517
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:19,257
As we explore this mysterious

518
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,417
Show known as "lost."

519
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:21,369
Alternate endings.

520
00:17:23,889 --> 00:17:25,010
Visits from more of the cast.

521
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:26,793
Our next guests are foreigners

522
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:27,553
To our land.

523
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,553
Please make them feel welcome.

524
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:31,874
Please say hello to Naveen

525
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:33,785
Andrews, Daniel Dae Kim and

526
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,082
Emilie De Ravin.

527
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:03,713
>> Jimmy: Welcome, welcome.

528
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:04,898
Thank you guys for coming.

529
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:08,289
And you have not seen -- have

530
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:09,801
Any of you seen the finale, the

531
00:18:09,937 --> 00:18:11,097
Entire finale?

532
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:12,035
>> no.

533
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:13,049
>> Jimmy: So you have no idea

534
00:18:13,146 --> 00:18:13,921
What's going on.

535
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:16,538
Why are you harboring skulls,

536
00:18:16,602 --> 00:18:17,401
Naveen?

537
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,410
>> it is a gift from Manson to

538
00:18:19,506 --> 00:18:20,513
Emilie.

539
00:18:20,585 --> 00:18:21,841
>> Jimmy: From Charles Manson?

540
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:24,889
From Marilyn Manson.

541
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:26,610
Such a big fan of the show.

542
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:29,906
Terry, I don't know if your

543
00:18:29,969 --> 00:18:32,106
Aware of this, but he painted a

544
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,249
Picture of John Locke.

545
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,177
>> oh, I've got it.

546
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,216
He gave me a print of it.

547
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:38,337
>> Jimmy: Oh, he did?

548
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,642
Can we see that?

549
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:41,800
Wow.

550
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:46,777
Very talented.

551
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,978
I'm surprised Marilyn isn't

552
00:18:49,072 --> 00:18:50,242
Wearing his Hawaiian shirt.

553
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,458
Naveen, you don't watch the

554
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,370
Show, do you?

555
00:18:54,472 --> 00:18:55,137
Is that true?

556
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:55,946
>> I saw the pilot.

557
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:56,761
We used to --

558
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,953
>> Jimmy: Saw the pilot.

559
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,945
>> you have to know what the

560
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,234
Piece is and what happens.

561
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,490
We used to go to each other's

562
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,768
Houses and I used to go outside

563
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,216
And have a cigarette and, you

564
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:06,898
Know.

565
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:09,994
No, I haven't seen the show.

566
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,009
>> Jimmy: Emilie, you were off

567
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:11,834
The show for a year.

568
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,032
During that time that you were

569
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:14,202
Off the show did you watch?

570
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:15,592
>> no, I didn't, consciously,

571
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:16,922
Because I figured Claire had no

572
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:18,225
Clue what was going on so --

573
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:19,465
>> Jimmy: Really, wow.

574
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,472
>> Emilie would not either.

575
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:21,377
>> Jimmy: Which was preferable

576
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:22,905
To you, playing sweet normal

577
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,136
Claire or "can't find my hair

578
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:26,025
Brush" --

579
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,184
>> um, you know, I don't know.

580
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,362
I actually like a lot of things

581
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:34,642
About the crazy Claire.

582
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,154
And very luckily that was a wig

583
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,793
So I probably -- if that wasn't,

584
00:19:37,882 --> 00:19:39,145
I probably wouldn't be saying

585
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:39,720
That.

586
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:40,560
>> Jimmy: Daniel, one of the

587
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,009
Most emotional moments of the

588
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,193
Show was when Jin and sun

589
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:47,136
Drowned together, and yet it

590
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:48,641
Seemed like somebody should have

591
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,210
Stayed around for the baby.

592
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,297
>> a lot of people come up to me

593
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:53,018
And say that.

594
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,121
>> Jimmy: I would think so,

595
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:54,786
Yeah.

596
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:55,665
>> they don't congratulate me on

597
00:19:55,713 --> 00:19:56,769
The great scene, they say "what

598
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:57,737
About the baby."

599
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,264
>> Jimmy: What about the baby?

600
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,537
>> what can you say?

601
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,385
>> Jimmy: How many kids can

602
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,552
Angelina Jolie adopt?

603
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:03,339
You can't just --

604
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,586
Daniel, every boat you're on

605
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,896
Exploded it seems like.

606
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,177
>> yeah, it's true.

607
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:14,386
Every season, I seem to be on a

608
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:15,202
Boat and --

609
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,114
>> and it explodes.

610
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:18,210
>> it explodes or we lose

611
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,082
Children, something.

612
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:20,097
>> Jimmy: Something terrible

613
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:21,097
Happens.

614
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,706
Something terrible has happened

615
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,201
Really to all of the characters.

616
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:25,498
How many times do you think you

617
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:27,201
Were beaten as Ben Linus?

618
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:31,266
>> how many episodes was I in?

619
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,506
>> Jimmy: And just double it?

620
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,553
>> it was a lot.

621
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:36,481
>> Jimmy: There was a lot of

622
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,082
Beating.

623
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:38,681
>> more than most TV characters.

624
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:39,666
>> Jimmy: Were you disliked

625
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,593
Personally on the set?

626
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,003
Why all the beatings?

627
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,003
>> I'm happy to say I never saw

628
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,305
A glimmer of relish in anyone's

629
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:46,913
Eye when they were coming after

630
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:47,609
Me.

631
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:48,498
>> except me.

632
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:49,433
>> Jimmy: Uh-oh.

633
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:50,633
All right.

634
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,657
Well, we'll be back with more

635
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:52,401
With the cast.

636
00:20:52,498 --> 00:20:53,489
Also tell you how you can get

637
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:55,065
Your very own piece of the

638
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,848
Island including delicious boxed

639
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:58,834
Lasagna as our "aloha to lost"

640
00:20:58,977 --> 00:20:59,873
Continues.

641
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,226
>> Jimmy: If you want to hold a

642
00:21:29,346 --> 00:21:30,634
Piece of "lost" history this

643
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:31,906
Summer they'll be an auction

644
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:33,714
Online where you can bid on such

645
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:35,978
Items as Walt's flash comic book

646
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:36,954
In espanol.

647
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:38,586
You can get one of Locke's

648
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:39,235
Knifes.

649
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:40,563
A box of Dharma initiative

650
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:41,394
Lasagna.

651
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:45,930
Go to profilesinhistory.Com and

652
00:21:46,075 --> 00:21:46,946
Register.

653
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,250
All the proceeds go to charity.

654
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:50,586
Let's meet the rest of the

655
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:51,330
Castaways.

656
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:52,187
Please welcome them.

657
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,811
Welcome, everyone.

658
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:27,994
I think we should start probably

659
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:29,315
With the -- maybe the biggest

660
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:31,714
Question for nester, are you or

661
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,235
Are you not wearing eye liner?

662
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:37,099
>> I was in a book store about a

663
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,882
Month ago with my wife and my

664
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:40,754
Kids and -- you know, just in

665
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:41,546
Line.

666
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:42,754
I feel this presence behind me.

667
00:22:42,811 --> 00:22:45,075
I hear this man say, wow, those

668
00:22:45,162 --> 00:22:46,394
Really are natural.

669
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,178
And I turn around.

670
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,186
At first I thought he was

671
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,338
Talking about my wife.

672
00:22:52,418 --> 00:22:55,163
And then I realized he's looking

673
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:55,962
At me.

674
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,209
I said thank you.

675
00:22:58,306 --> 00:22:59,265
>> Jimmy: That's right.

676
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,362
People don't realize you're

677
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,922
One-quarter raccoon and hence --

678
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:07,041
Jeremy, I heard that somebody

679
00:23:07,106 --> 00:23:08,531
Pulled a prank on you as far

680
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:10,203
As -- regarding this appearance

681
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:11,235
On the show?

682
00:23:11,314 --> 00:23:12,107
>> indeed.

683
00:23:12,178 --> 00:23:13,203
>> Jimmy: What did they tell you

684
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,123
Was going to happen?

685
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:15,234
>> I'm devastated.

686
00:23:16,491 --> 00:23:17,875
Because it's not happening.

687
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:18,666
>> Jimmy: Yeah, tell everyone

688
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:19,619
What it was.

689
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:20,747
I'd like to know who told you

690
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:21,619
This too.

691
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:27,170
>> I heard from somebody -- that

692
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,266
There was going to be strip

693
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:29,970
Poker and a snowball fight.

694
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,875
>> Jimmy: Snowball fight.

695
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,163
>> and I rehearsed, man.

696
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:36,195
It's all I prepared.

697
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:37,659
>> Jimmy: Are you often the

698
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:39,747
Victim of little practical jokes

699
00:23:39,842 --> 00:23:40,586
Like that?

700
00:23:40,642 --> 00:23:41,522
You really believe there's going

701
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,499
To be a snowball fight here?

702
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,027
>> I did.

703
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:46,378
>> Jimmy: Don't worry, there

704
00:23:46,442 --> 00:23:47,659
Will be no snowballs.

705
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:50,371
Michael, first of all, Harold,

706
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:51,619
I'm sorry, I'm calling you

707
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:52,306
Michael.

708
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:53,258
>> everybody does it, all the

709
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:54,459
Time.

710
00:23:54,586 --> 00:23:55,642
I don't know.

711
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:56,714
>> Jimmy: Just change it to

712
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:57,210
Michael.

713
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:57,907
>> I might as well.

714
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:58,843
>> Jimmy: Michael's a nice name.

715
00:23:58,915 --> 00:23:59,955
Friends can call you Mike.

716
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:00,754
>> okay.

717
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:03,267
>> Jimmy: First of all, thank

718
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,714
You for killing Ana Lucia.

719
00:24:10,738 --> 00:24:11,386
So --

720
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,338
>> no, no.

721
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:13,195
>> Jimmy: Your character did

722
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:13,955
Some bad things.

723
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:14,802
>> yes.

724
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:15,570
>> Jimmy: You weren't in the

725
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,339
Church.

726
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,074
>> right.

727
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,090
>> Jimmy: Where do you think

728
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,026
Michael is?

729
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:21,522
>> well, I think, you know, that

730
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:22,394
We answered that.

731
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,378
Michael's -- he's stuck on the

732
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,010
Island.

733
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:24,747
>> Jimmy: Still roaming on the

734
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:25,258
Island?

735
00:24:25,362 --> 00:24:26,883
>> with the other people, just

736
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,514
Whispering to people.

737
00:24:30,332 --> 00:24:31,770
For the rest of -- for eternity,

738
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:32,570
Whispering.

739
00:24:32,634 --> 00:24:33,338
It sucks.

740
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:34,346
>> Jimmy: You're sentenced to

741
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:34,962
Muttering.

742
00:24:35,026 --> 00:24:36,234
>> exactly.

743
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:38,371
>> Jimmy: And what do people say

744
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:39,642
To you when they meet Charles

745
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:40,234
Widmore?

746
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,818
Just you walking out here I got

747
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:42,778
Nervous.

748
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:45,635
>> nothing.

749
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:47,426
>> Jimmy: Nothing at all?

750
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:50,875
>> which is very nice.

751
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,170
>> Jimmy: Sure.

752
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,366
In Australia, you play like a

753
00:24:54,455 --> 00:24:56,215
Very friendly TV dad?

754
00:24:56,302 --> 00:24:57,238
>> yeah, I was Australia's

755
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,854
Favorite dad for many years.

756
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:00,591
>> Jimmy: See, you go from being

757
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,047
Like australia's bill co

758
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:04,878
>> to Charles Widmore.

759
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,855
>> Jimmy: Who at the end, maybe

760
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:10,063
He was redeemed somewhat as

761
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:10,942
Well.

762
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:12,614
Would you agree with that?

763
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,166
>> I wish you hadn't asked me

764
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,134
That question.

765
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:17,271
I still don't know if he's a

766
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,399
Good guy or a bad guy.

767
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:20,750
>> Jimmy: I think there are a

768
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:21,903
Lot of blurry lines as far as

769
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,079
Who's good and who's bad on the

770
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:23,808
Show.

771
00:25:23,895 --> 00:25:24,623
>> yeah.

772
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:25,871
>> Jimmy: But you were pretty

773
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:26,662
Bad.

774
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:29,806
>> well, I thought it was fun.

775
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:31,791
>> Jimmy: Harold, what happened

776
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:32,567
To Walt?

777
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,246
He's 8 feet tall now, right?

778
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,838
>> he's 8 feet tall and dating

779
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,126
And -- I don't -- that's what

780
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:39,966
Happened to him.

781
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,071
>> Jimmy: So it's his fault

782
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:42,447
Because he had to go and grow

783
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,719
That you weren't on the show

784
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:44,327
That much.

785
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:45,757
>> well, yeah, sort of.

786
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,815
Maybe.

787
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:49,647
>> Jimmy: You got to give these

788
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:50,574
Kid cigarettes.

789
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:51,558
I told them Gary Coleman, I did.

790
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:54,501
>> they were hoping for Gary

791
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:55,727
Coleman but it didn't work out

792
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:56,311
That way.

793
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:57,045
He actually grew.

794
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:58,807
>> Jimmy: When we come back, we

795
00:25:58,855 --> 00:25:59,894
Have something very special.

796
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:01,550
We have some of the alternate
