1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,228
Previously on Lost.

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:04,733
Anything over $10,000
has to be declared.

3
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:08,010
You... didn't declare this.

4
00:00:08,137 --> 00:00:09,919
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

5
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,679
- I told you people, I don't know anything!
- Dude, just calm down!

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,347
Why did you follow me?!
Your wife sent me!

7
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,604
There's something we have to do.

8
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,950
She said you have to stop
the man in black.

9
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,861
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

10
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:24,549
What's on Hydra Island?

11
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:27,851
A plane. The same plane
that brought your friends back.

12
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:30,972
So I want you to go over there
and do some recon.

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,956
Who are you?

14
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,038
Put your weapon down!

15
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:36,427
Take me to your leader.

16
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,175
So why don't you tell me what
brought you over to this island?

17
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:42,248
John Locke sent me.
Well, here's the deal, chief.

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,086
I'll go back over there
and tell him the coast is clear,

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,440
that I didn't find anybody.

20
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:49,141
Then I'll bring the old man
right to your doorstep.

21
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:51,606
And what do you want
in exchange, James?

22
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:54,385
You give us safe passage
off the island.

23
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,310
Want some cocoa?

24
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:11,412
Where'd you find cocoa?

25
00:01:11,537 --> 00:01:14,998
I didn't. Pretend.

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,937
How's the leg?

27
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,579
Still hurts.

28
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,019
You should leave the bandage off
for a while. The air'll do it some good.

29
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:37,633
I'll try that.

30
00:01:38,322 --> 00:01:39,848
You mind if I sit down?

31
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,716
I know you and I haven't
had time to talk,

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,834
but I was wondering
if James had filled you in

33
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:54,156
on what I showed him
at the cliffs.

34
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:58,116
You mean the cave. The one
with the names on the wall.

35
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,659
Most of the names
have been crossed off now.

36
00:02:01,784 --> 00:02:03,402
There are just a few left.

37
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,301
"Kwon" is one of them.

38
00:02:06,808 --> 00:02:09,305
Does that mean me or Sun?

39
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,568
Well, Jin, I'm not sure.

40
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:15,634
But what it does mean is that
the only way we can leave the island

41
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:18,674
is if all the names
that haven't been crossed off

42
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,474
go together.

43
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:22,452
But Sun's not here.

44
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:26,332
You just take care
of that leg.

45
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:27,752
I'm workin' on it.

46
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:39,503
All right, Mr. Kwon,

47
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,816
here's your suitcase
and your watch.

48
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,691
Money?

49
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:52,764
I'm sorry. Federal law says we have
to confiscate your $25,000.

50
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,349
- C-confiscate?
- It means that if you want it back,

51
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:59,113
you're gonna have to fill out
the necessary paperwork.

52
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,041
Uh... money.

53
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,796
You can exit
right over there, sir.

54
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:38,330
May I help you?

55
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:41,292
Paik.

56
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,417
A reservation for Paik.

57
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:45,408
Yes.
I've got it right here.

58
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:48,699
We've got a beautiful ocean view
room for you on the 8th floor.

59
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:51,975
Two room. Two.

60
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,878
No marry.

61
00:03:56,165 --> 00:03:57,118
Oh.

62
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,010
Kwon. Jin Soo Kwon.

63
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:02,216
I'm sorry. I apologize.

64
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:05,502
Yes, there is a separate
room reservation for Kwon.

65
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:07,881
Room 842. Here you go, sir.

66
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:11,437
Miss. Paik, Mr. Kwon,
welcome to Los Angeles.

67
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm leaving for a little while.
I got an errand to run.

68
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,063
When will you be back?

69
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,260
Morning.

70
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,821
Keep an eye on the camp
while I'm gone.

71
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,088
I don't feel anything.

72
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:34,710
Excuse me?

73
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,986
Anger,

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,166
happiness...

75
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:40,337
pain.

76
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,225
I don't feel it anymore.

77
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,906
Maybe that's best, Sayid.

78
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:51,392
It'll help you get through
what's comin'.

79
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,455
What are you doin', Hoss?

80
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,448
I'm getting out of here
before that thing comes back.

81
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:16,653
What thing?

82
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,592
Locke.

83
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:20,445
And you're just
sitting around here,

84
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,791
- listening to whatever he tells you.
- I ain't listenin' to nobody.

85
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,655
I already told you
I have a deal with Widmore.

86
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:26,930
So if you just calm...

87
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,233
It doesn't matter who
you have a deal with.

88
00:05:28,256 --> 00:05:30,931
I've waited long enough.
I'm going to find my wife.

89
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:35,042
- Find her where?
- I'll go back to the temple.

90
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,907
And if she's not there,
I'll try the beach.

91
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,095
But I will find Sun,
so stop trying to...

92
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:49,150
Go! Uhh!

93
00:05:50,868 --> 00:05:52,504
Aah!
Uhh!

94
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,726
Is this the guy?

95
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:12,602
Yeah. Let's take him.

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,853
Lost Season 6 Episode 10
"The package"

97
00:06:31,203 --> 00:06:33,444
Play your card, Captain.

98
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,046
Now what?

99
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:39,823
We wait.

100
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:41,528
Wait... for what?

101
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:44,002
For Richard to come back.

102
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:45,971
You'll forgive my scepticism, but

103
00:06:46,537 --> 00:06:49,750
the last thing Richard said before
he went stomping off into the jungle,

104
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,142
was that we were all in hell,

105
00:06:51,265 --> 00:06:53,814
and he had no idea what
we were supposed to do next.

106
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,640
In fact, I would bet money
we never see him again.

107
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,117
Hugo will find him.

108
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,155
He will track him down
and bring him back.

109
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,080
Unless Alpert's covered
in bacon grease,

110
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:06,501
- I'm not sure Hurley can track anything.
- Hey. Don't talk about bacon.

111
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,045
Jacob has never lied to me before.

112
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,834
If he said Richard knows what to do,
then Richard knows what to do.

113
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,186
He'll come back.

114
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,204
And until then, we wait.

115
00:07:36,691 --> 00:07:38,341
How are the tomatoes?

116
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:41,494
Dead.

117
00:07:44,066 --> 00:07:46,448
I remember when you
first planted this here.

118
00:07:47,396 --> 00:07:49,445
It feels like a hundred years ago.

119
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,958
You don't believe Alpert's
coming back, do you?

120
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,234
I don't care
if he comes back.

121
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,954
What about us...

122
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:01,146
being candidates?

123
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,749
What about it?

124
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:08,078
Hurley took me
to a lighthouse.

125
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,840
To Jacob's lighthouse.

126
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:13,866
And... there was a mirror,

127
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,528
and all around it, there were...

128
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,232
there were hundreds of
names written down.

129
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:22,207
I don't care. I don't care about
Alpert or being a candidate.

130
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:23,984
Sun...

131
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,199
There's a reason why
we were brought...

132
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:29,284
I don't wanna hear about how
this is our purpose or destiny!

133
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:34,183
I just want you to go away
and leave me alone.

134
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:54,855
Sun.

135
00:10:56,397 --> 00:10:59,098
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to startle you.

136
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:05,463
Bad day?

137
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,692
What are you doing here?

138
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,291
I found your husband.

139
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:14,597
What?

140
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,219
I promised you
I would reunite you two.

141
00:11:17,228 --> 00:11:19,831
Took me a little longer
than I thought it would.

142
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:23,573
But he's with my people back
at my camp across the island.

143
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,504
I can take you
to him right now.

144
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,207
I don't believe you.

145
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,380
You killed those
people at the temple.

146
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,646
Those people were confused.

147
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,333
They were lied to.

148
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,955
I didn't want to hurt them.

149
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,797
Any one of them could've
chosen to come with me.

150
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:50,393
And I'm giving you
that choice, Sun, right now.

151
00:11:52,374 --> 00:11:54,865
I would never make you
do anything against your will.

152
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,449
I'm asking you.

153
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,319
Please.

154
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,830
Come with me.

155
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,519
Jin is waiting.

156
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:13,697
Sun!

157
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:23,775
Sun, wait!

158
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:15,545
Miss. Paik.

159
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:16,848
Hi.

160
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,097
I'm, uh, Martin Keamy.

161
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,399
I'm a friend of your father's.

162
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:28,477
You mind if I come in?

163
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,378
I believe you've got
something for me. Hmm?

164
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,896
Sun?

165
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,061
Sun, can you hear me?

166
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,099
What happened?

167
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,090
You all right?

168
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:52,900
I'm sorry, what?

169
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:00,643
Sun, slow do. Tell me
what happened in English.

170
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,580
Who did this to you?

171
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,119
Locke.

172
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,959
Sayid.

173
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,472
Sayid.

174
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:41,779
Hey.

175
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,436
What happened?

176
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,594
We were attacked.

177
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:50,033
By whom?

178
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,515
I don't know.

179
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:57,035
Where is Jin?

180
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,543
Hey!

181
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:23,203
Hey!

182
00:16:53,556 --> 00:16:55,664
Wow, that was weird, huh?

183
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,275
Where am I?

184
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:01,698
It's called room 23.

185
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:05,092
The Dharma Initiative
was doing experiments

186
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,954
on subliminal messaging in here.

187
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,911
But you know all about the Dharma
Initiative, don't you Mr. Kwon?

188
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,702
- Why did you bring me here?
- Relax. You're safe.

189
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,422
I'm leaving.

190
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,240
Sorry.

191
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:24,317
But we went
to a lot of trouble

192
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:26,281
getting you here
of the other island.

193
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,325
And I can't let you leave.

194
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,896
What do you want from me?

195
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:40,544
These are grid maps that...
that the Dharma people used

196
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:43,460
to identify pockets
of electromagnetism.

197
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,659
Whoever signed these
could really help me out.

198
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:50,919
Uh, I know... I know
the writing's difficult to read,

199
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:54,978
but... but it sure looks like
it says, "Jin Soo Kwon."

200
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:56,667
So...

201
00:17:56,913 --> 00:17:58,653
Is it you or isn't it?

202
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:01,859
You want answers
to your questions?

203
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,401
Then get me your boss.

204
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:09,150
I want to talk
with Charles Widmore.

205
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,610
Well, then you're in luck...

206
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:16,666
Mr. Kwon. Because he'd like
to talk to you, too.

207
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,021
You a good swimmer?

208
00:18:22,384 --> 00:18:24,620
- Good enough.
- Wrap this in plastic.

209
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,302
You don't want it to get wet.
We're taking the outrigger.

210
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:35,135
Something wrong, Claire?

211
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,464
Um...

212
00:18:47,592 --> 00:18:49,199
What... what you said to Jin...

213
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:51,684
about the names on the wall.

214
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,544
You told him you needed
them all to get off the island.

215
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:56,009
Yes, I did.

216
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,008
Was, uh... was my name
on the wall?

217
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:01,907
No.

218
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:05,056
Well, then it doesn't matter
if I get on that plane, then.

219
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,298
I mean, you don't need me.

220
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,301
No, that's not true
Claire. I need you.

221
00:19:12,678 --> 00:19:14,724
And there's plenty of room
on that plane for all of us.

222
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:22,200
Well, when we go home,
Aaron's not gonna know me.

223
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:25,830
Stranger to my own son,
he thinks Kate's his mother.

224
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:31,957
Is her name on the wall?

225
00:19:34,068 --> 00:19:35,822
No, Claire, it isn't...

226
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,854
not anymore.

227
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:39,584
But I need Kate.

228
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:41,490
Why?

229
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:45,014
Because I'm three people shy
of getting off this island,

230
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:47,601
and Kate can help me get
these people on that plane.

231
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,281
But once she does...

232
00:19:55,734 --> 00:19:58,682
then whatever happens, happens.

233
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:07,898
What's up with the guns?

234
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,906
You two going somewhere?

235
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,051
We're taking a boat ride
over to the other island.

236
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,457
What do you need a boat for?

237
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,592
Can't you just turn into smoke
and fly your ass over the water?

238
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:21,084
Do you think if I could do that,
I would still be on this island?

239
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:23,391
No, 'cause that'd be
ridiculous.

240
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:27,380
What the hell you going
over there for, anyway?

241
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,252
I thought you were trying
to avoid Charlie Widmore.

242
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,148
They took one of
our people, James.

243
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,587
So I'm going to get them back.

244
00:20:58,355 --> 00:20:59,875
Oh, this for me?

245
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:04,886
Uh, this is really nice.

246
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:08,313
Your bodyguard is supposed
to give me some money.

247
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,499
Where's Mr. Kwon?

248
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:11,894
No English.

249
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,022
Hmm?

250
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:17,034
All right. Uh, sit down.

251
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,462
I checked his room.
He's not there.

252
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:37,315
Check the bathroom.

253
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:47,293
Come on. Let's go.

254
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,187
Mr. Kwon, why don't you
come and join us?

255
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,406
Look, thank you
for the watch, okay?

256
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,981
But you're also supposed to give me
an envelope with money in it...

257
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:04,786
$25,000.

258
00:22:04,787 --> 00:22:05,547
Yeah?

259
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,188
Stop that.

260
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,555
I feel like I'm in a
damn "Godzilla" movie.

261
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,750
What's that guy's name? The, um...

262
00:22:18,676 --> 00:22:20,583
The Russian guy... speaks like,
nine different languages.

263
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:22,161
Uh, uh, Danny's friend.

264
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:24,868
- Mikhail.
- Mikhail. Can he speak Korean?

265
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,662
- I think so.
- Okay, go get him.

266
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,120
Now put your damn clothes on.

267
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:43,444
She says the money her father
gave them was taken at customs.

268
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,554
Mm, that's not my problem.

269
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,573
She wants you to let them
please go to the bank.

270
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:55,064
They will get it for you.

271
00:23:06,056 --> 00:23:07,990
You take her to the bank.

272
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:10,729
I'll take Casanova here
to the restaurant.

273
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:13,386
And then we'll meet there.

274
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,218
What's he whining about?

275
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:28,376
He wants you to promise,
that you won't tell her father

276
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:29,795
that they are involved.

277
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:34,573
Oh, hey, don't worry about that.

278
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,218
Okay. Your secret
is safe with me.

279
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,448
Okay? Just bring me the money,

280
00:23:39,573 --> 00:23:42,048
and then we can all live
happily ever after, right?

281
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:59,260
What?

282
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,493
Oh, for the fourth time,
I was gathering mangoes,

283
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,586
and she was already
unconscious when I found her.

284
00:24:04,711 --> 00:24:07,080
- Why won't you believe me?
- Because you're speaking.

285
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,627
You got a pretty
decent-sized bump.

286
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,020
Might be a slight concussion.

287
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:14,403
You can understand
what I'm saying,

288
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:16,626
but you can only speak Korean.

289
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,432
She hits her head
and forgets English?

290
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:23,599
Are we supposed to buy that?

291
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,088
Asked the man who
communes with the dead.

292
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:28,140
It might be aphasia.

293
00:24:28,981 --> 00:24:31,909
It's, um, a condition
that's caused by trauma

294
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,805
and affects the language
centre of your brain.

295
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,429
But it's usually temporary.

296
00:24:36,325 --> 00:24:37,569
Sun.

297
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:39,275
You're gonna be okay.

298
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,869
What are you smiling about?

299
00:24:51,914 --> 00:24:53,654
Pack your bags. We're leaving.

300
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:15,924
Don't move!

301
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:19,174
Let me see your hands!

302
00:25:20,065 --> 00:25:23,146
Easy, friend.
I come in peace.

303
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:46,201
Do you know who I am?

304
00:25:47,017 --> 00:25:48,624
Charles Widmore.

305
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:51,039
Do you know who I am?

306
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,747
Obviously, you're not John Locke.

307
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,574
Everything else I know
is a combination of myth,

308
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,099
ghost stories and jungle
noises in the night.

309
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,655
I think you know more than that,
judging by these... pylons.

310
00:26:04,435 --> 00:26:05,747
Why did you come here?

311
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:08,914
You took one of
my people, Jin Kwon.

312
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,311
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

313
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:24,092
A wise man once said that
war was coming to this island.

314
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,138
I think it just got here.

315
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,405
Where exactly are we going, Richard?

316
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,747
- Where's Locke?
- What?

317
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:44,242
You said he came to recruit you.
Where did he say he'd be?

318
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,644
Hydra Island.

319
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,305
Which is exactly where
you landed the plane

320
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,464
- that you flew back here, right?
- That's right.

321
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,183
This... man wants to leave the island,

322
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:53,756
and that plane's the
only way he can do it.

323
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,537
You wanna know where we're
going? We're gonna stop him.

324
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,457
This is your fault, isn't it?

325
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,177
Sort of.

326
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:01,538
How are you gonna stop him
from getting on that plane?

327
00:27:01,824 --> 00:27:03,233
We have to destroy it.

328
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,263
Why isn't she speaking English?

329
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,038
She was hit on the head when
she was running away from Locke.

330
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:16,711
He came back here?

331
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:18,828
What... what did he want?

332
00:27:18,879 --> 00:27:22,760
What did he say to you?
You... you understand me?

333
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,922
I don't think she wants to come.

334
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:15,585
Miss. Paik would like to know
if there is a problem.

335
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,782
I'm sorry. I'm showing
that your account was closed.

336
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:22,021
The balance is zero.

337
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,829
If she may ask, who
closed the account, please?

338
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,679
Looks like... her father.

339
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:39,065
Mr. Woo Jung Paik had access.

340
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,898
The funds were transferred

341
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:44,443
to one of his other accounts
at our main branch in Seoul.

342
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:01,889
- Uhh!
- Get in here.

343
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:07,871
Let's get in.
Come on, get In.

344
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:11,400
What's going on?

345
00:29:11,486 --> 00:29:13,206
I bumped his head on the door.

346
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,112
Oh, come on Omar. You gotta
be more careful than that.

347
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,313
I got this.

348
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,072
And go get the Arab guy.

349
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:30,417
Hey. I'm an Arab.

350
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:32,308
Just go pick him up.

351
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:37,345
Sorry about that.

352
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:41,066
Omar's loyal, but he
lacks attention to detail.

353
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,768
You don't really understand a word
I'm saying to you right now, do you?

354
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:46,174
Nothin'?

355
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:49,588
All right. Just hold still, okay?

356
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,180
I'm gonna strap you in here.

357
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,873
Just in case you figure out
what's about to happen to you,

358
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:59,308
I can't have you freaking out.

359
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,791
I don't think you realize...

360
00:30:05,246 --> 00:30:08,313
how unhappy Mr. Paik was
when he found out that

361
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,418
you were doing his little girl.

362
00:30:12,336 --> 00:30:14,475
Well, you know that 25 grand

363
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,070
that you were supposed to deliver?

364
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:20,529
That was my fee
for popping you.

365
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,428
From what I hear, you know

366
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:26,692
anyone who works for, Paik
knows the cardinal rule...

367
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,853
hands off the boss' daughter.

368
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:33,622
But you... you couldn't
resist her, could you?

369
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:41,818
The heart wants
what the heart wants.

370
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:49,814
Thank you.

371
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:56,662
I'm sorry.

372
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,600
Some people just aren't
meant to be together.

373
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:13,373
What the hell
were you thinking?

374
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,350
I'm sorry. I know.
I know we panicked.

375
00:31:15,387 --> 00:31:16,953
This was not supposed
to happen for days.

376
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,418
We had a timetable.

377
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:19,575
See, he was leaving their camp.

378
00:31:19,698 --> 00:31:22,049
Well, you should have let him leave
and taken him in the jungle.

379
00:31:22,175 --> 00:31:24,728
Well, maybe you should put
a mercenary in charge

380
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,413
instead of a geophysicist.

381
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:32,700
What's done is done.

382
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,357
I need you to get the
package from the submarine

383
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,005
and take it to the infirmary.

384
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:39,266
Can you do that
for me please, Zoe?

385
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:40,513
Yeah, sure.

386
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:47,022
Mr. Kwon.

387
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:52,071
My deepest apologies for everything
that's been done to you.

388
00:31:52,197 --> 00:31:53,768
- My name is...
- I know who you are.

389
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:55,950
Why did you bring me here?

390
00:31:56,734 --> 00:31:58,320
We searched the Ajira plane,

391
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:00,843
discovered your wife's luggage
and found this inside.

392
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:05,490
I thought you might want
to have it. Go ahead.

393
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,092
Turn it on.

394
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:24,630
Her name is, Ji Yeon.

395
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,344
Your daughter.

396
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:36,782
I understand you've never
seen her before.

397
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:52,863
I have a daughter, too.

398
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:56,012
I know what it's like
to be kept apart.

399
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:01,856
I understand the one thing you want

400
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,028
is to be reunited with
your wife and daughter.

401
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:07,457
But it would be short-lived

402
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,407
if that... thing

403
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,403
masquerading as John Locke
ever got off this island.

404
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,231
Your wife, your
daughter, my daughter...

405
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:16,422
everyone we know and love...

406
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,548
Would simply cease to be.

407
00:33:22,268 --> 00:33:24,562
I came here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

408
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:27,573
How?

409
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:31,006
Come with me.

410
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,758
I think it's time for
you to see the package.

411
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,326
What package?

412
00:33:37,247 --> 00:33:38,788
It's not a "what."

413
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:42,954
It's a "who."

414
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,467
Who are you?

415
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:31,742
No English.

416
00:34:32,502 --> 00:34:35,285
I don't know why you're here,
and I don't really care.

417
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,232
No!

418
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:41,745
Free.

419
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,186
Free!

420
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,258
Free.

421
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:07,329
Good luck.

422
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,208
Martin

423
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,078
Martin?

424
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:50,833
Who did this to you?

425
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,611
Look behind you, you idiot.

426
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:22,253
I brought you a couple of things.

427
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,534
I was thinking about a patient
that I had during my residency.

428
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:32,549
Car crash, banged his head.

429
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,462
When he woke up,
he couldn't talk.

430
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:38,503
The guy was frustrated. I mean...

431
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,098
who wouldn't be?

432
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:44,459
And then one of the nurses said,
"just because he can't speak

433
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:45,814
doesn't mean
that he can't write."

434
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:50,741
Think you could give it a try?

435
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:06,866
It'll take a little longer
to get your point across,

436
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:09,240
but at least you have
your voice back.

437
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:15,749
I went back out to your garden
to see if he was there.

438
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,603
He wasn't, but...

439
00:38:20,179 --> 00:38:21,481
then I found this.

440
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,740
That's one stubborn tomato.

441
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,934
Guess no one told it
it was supposed to die.

442
00:38:48,507 --> 00:38:50,007
Don't worry about it.

443
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:53,116
You're not the first person
to tell me to leave them alone.

444
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:02,124
Locke...

445
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,603
What did he say to you?

446
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,290
Why didn't you go with him?

447
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:26,044
Do you trust me?

448
00:39:36,386 --> 00:39:37,468
Sun...

449
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,860
come with us, and
I'll help you find Jin.

450
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,059
I'll help you find him, and I'll
get you both on that plane

451
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:47,620
and as far away from
this island as you can get.

452
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,620
I promise.

453
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:17,913
Where'd you go?

454
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:19,983
What?

455
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,261
Looked like your brain
took a little stroll.

456
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,341
Why aren't you worried, James?

457
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,008
I am worried.

458
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,679
Just really good
at pretending I ain't.

459
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,283
But I got a feeling
this is almost over.

460
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,130
'Cause if Locke rode over there
on the boat with Sayid,

461
00:40:40,162 --> 00:40:42,608
then Charlie Widmore blew him
right out of the water.

462
00:40:43,262 --> 00:40:44,399
And what if he didn't?

463
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,379
Well, then we're screwed
six ways from sun...

464
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:51,866
Oh, hell.

465
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,272
He's alone.

466
00:40:57,531 --> 00:40:59,521
Thought you went
over there to find Jin.

467
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,510
They said they didn't have him.

468
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:05,624
- And you believed that.
- No.

469
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:08,813
Where's Sayid, Did
you lose him, too?

470
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:11,008
When you over there, James,

471
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:12,487
you mentioned that
Widmore had someone

472
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,452
guarding a room
on his submarine...

473
00:41:14,846 --> 00:41:17,512
guarding something that
he didn't want you to see.

474
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:18,676
Yeah, so?

475
00:41:20,018 --> 00:41:22,008
I don't like secrets.

476
00:41:34,506 --> 00:41:36,841
Okay, come on. All right.

477
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:39,081
Hey, be careful with him.

478
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,196
All right.

479
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,765
Okay. The guy can hardly stand.

480
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,376
Well, what do you expect?

481
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:52,125
Oh!

482
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,409
How much did you give him?

483
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:01,319
Obviously, I gave him too much.

484
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,559
But, we needed him
knocked out for the trip.

485
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:03,962
