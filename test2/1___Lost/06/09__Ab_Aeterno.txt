1
00:00:01,347 --> 00:00:03,306
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,573
- Who is he?
- His name is Richard Alpert.

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,701
He's a kind of... advisor.

4
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:13,419
And he has had that job for a very,
very long time.

5
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:14,806
Why do you want to die?

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,645
I devoted my life--

7
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:19,726
longer than you can
possibly imagine--

8
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:21,895
in service of a man

9
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:24,697
who told me that everything
was happening for a reason,

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,929
that he had a plan-
a plan that I was a part of--

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,941
and now that man's gone.
So why do I want to die?

12
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,575
Because I just found out my
entire life had no purpose.

13
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,639
I'm here because I need your help.

14
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,876
Will you help me, Ilana?

15
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,510
Yes.

16
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:19,327
There's six people I
need you to protect.

17
00:01:20,166 --> 00:01:22,051
I'm gonna give you a
list of their names.

18
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,252
This is what you've
been preparing for.

19
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:28,890
These people-- who are they?

20
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,861
They're the remaining candidates.

21
00:01:38,954 --> 00:01:40,384
Candidates?

22
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:41,932
Candidates for what?

23
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,067
To replace Jacob.

24
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,655
She said I was one of them.

25
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:51,120
And so are you, and so is Hurley.

26
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,568
Well, that's great.
So what do we do now?

27
00:01:57,525 --> 00:01:58,925
I don't know.

28
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,334
Then who d hen who does?

29
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,134
After I've brought
them to the temple...

30
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,642
What do I do?

31
00:02:12,617 --> 00:02:14,003
Ask ricardus.

32
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:16,833
He'll know what to do next.

33
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:19,420
Who's ricardus?

34
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:24,121
He is.

35
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,687
So, Richard...

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,887
What do we do next?

37
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:36,754
I have no idea what "we" do next.

38
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,804
You didn't tell your friends that

39
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:42,693
I was trying to kill
myself when you found me?

40
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:47,127
Does that sound like
someone who has a plan?

41
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:49,263
Why would Jacob say you knew
what to do if...

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,141
Because everything
he ever said is a lie.

43
00:02:51,261 --> 00:02:52,896
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:55,648 --> 00:02:57,216
You wanna know a secret, Jack?

45
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:00,530
Something I've known a long,
long time?

46
00:03:06,374 --> 00:03:07,585
You're dead.

47
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,996
You mean that figuratively, right?
No. I mean, literally.

48
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:15,363
We're all dead-
every single one of us.

49
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,497
And this? This--all this?
It's not what you think it is.

50
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,996
We're not on an island.
We never were.

51
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:24,697
We're in hell.

52
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:28,118
So I'm not interested
in what Jacob said.

53
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:31,318
In fact, maybe it's time
we stopped listening to him

54
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,230
and we started listening
to someone else.

55
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,592
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

56
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:11,429
What are you doing?

57
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:15,387
- I'm going after Richard.
- Why? You heard him.

58
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,307
He doesn't--he doesn't know
what we need to do next.

59
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,069
He knows. Jacob told me.
He has to know.

60
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,801
Alpert has lost his mind.

61
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,763
He thinks that we're-
we're in hell.

62
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:26,270
And if he care about
what Jacob said,

63
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,482
he wouldn't be talking about-
about listening to someone else.

64
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:32,490
Wait.

65
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,842
You know who he meant?

66
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,814
Oh, this should be interesting.

67
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:37,438
What?

68
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:39,373
He meant Locke.

69
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:45,845
Locke is dead.

70
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:49,526
If it's any consolation,
it's not exactly Locke.

71
00:04:58,473 --> 00:04:59,618
Hurley.

72
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,435
What's he sayin'?

73
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,341
Uh, wh-what's who saying?

74
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,931
Jacob. I saw you talking to him.
I'm not talking to Jacob.

75
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,619
Don't lie to me.
Please, if you something...

76
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:12,922
- Anything that can help us figure out...
- It's not Jacob, man.

77
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,330
Then who is it?

78
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:18,949
Sorry, Jack, but this has
nothing to do with you.

79
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,463
Shephard is right, you know.
Right about what?

80
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,264
Richard.

81
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,706
Going after him is a waste of time.
He doesn't know anything.

82
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:41,520
- What makes you so sure?
- I've known him since I was 12 years old.

83
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,808
That should count for something.

84
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,385
So you guys met when
you were kids, huh?

85
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:45,925
No, Frank, I was a kid.

86
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,974
Richard looked just
like he does today.

87
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,899
You're saying this guy doesn't age?

88
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,575
That's exactly what I'm saying.

89
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,841
And how the hell do you
think that happened?

90
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:32,787
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti.

91
00:12:32,907 --> 00:12:33,801
Amen.

92
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,883
No.

93
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,541
- Is this him?
- Yes.

94
00:14:37,156 --> 00:14:38,781
Estate quieto.

95
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,682
You say he speaks English.

96
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,250
Yes, Mr. whitfield.

97
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,209
Do you speak English?

98
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,816
I asked, do you speak English?

99
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,688
Take him away and bring me another.

100
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:04,832
- Hang him.
- Yes, I speak it! Yes, I speak it!

101
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:05,966
Wait.

102
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,243
You have strong hands.
What sort of work did you do?

103
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,910
I-I work... I work...
I-in the Fields.

104
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,693
- I understand you're interested in going to the new world.
- Yes.

105
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:19,957
Well, then...

106
00:15:20,682 --> 00:15:23,177
- This is your lucky day.
- Thank you, father.

107
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:26,920
This man is now the property
of Captain Magnus hanso.

108
00:15:29,047 --> 00:15:30,877
I hope you don't get seasick.

109
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,543
Do you see anything?!

110
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:34,053
- Bring me the Captain.
- Sir, Captain Hanso's dead.

111
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,370
Good God, we're in the
middle of a bloody jungle!

112
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:06,539
Gracias a dios. Gracias.

113
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,986
Muchas gracias.

114
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:14,495
No! Stop! No!

115
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,029
No! Stop!

116
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:24,689
What are youoing?! Aah!

117
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,011
Se lo ruego.

118
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,349
No lo haga.

119
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,267
No lo haga, por favor.

120
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:35,356
We are shipwrecked in the
middle of the jungle.

121
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:38,210
We have no fresh water

122
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:40,338
and limited supplies,

123
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:42,711
and there are only
five officers left.

124
00:18:43,284 --> 00:18:45,176
No! No! No!

125
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:54,891
Why-- why are you doing this?

126
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,722
Because if I freed you,

127
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,976
it would only be a matter of time

128
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,665
before you tried to kill me.

129
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:05,549
No!

130
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:24,826
Aah!

131
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,656
What happened up there?

132
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,426
I said report!

133
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:44,199
Isabella!

134
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:46,180
Isabella!

135
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,396
Shh. Here.

136
00:25:47,203 --> 00:25:48,504
Water.

137
00:26:08,406 --> 00:26:10,271
Who...

138
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,277
Who... who are you?

139
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,150
A friend.

140
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,755
I am...

141
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,318
In hell?

142
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,077
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

143
00:26:23,204 --> 00:26:24,546
You...

144
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,714
You were not on the ship.

145
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:33,387
I was here...

146
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,681
Long before your ship.

147
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:37,013
Did--did...

148
00:26:37,047 --> 00:26:38,956
Did you see my--my wife?

149
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:41,314
- I'm sorry?
- Isabella. My wife.

150
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,213
She was here. She was...

151
00:26:44,422 --> 00:26:48,747
But... then the black smoke came,

152
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,855
and she ran.

153
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:53,014
And she hasn't come back?

154
00:26:57,406 --> 00:26:59,091
That probably mean he has her.

155
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:00,265
Who?

156
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,387
I think you know who.

157
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:06,462
If she's a-alive, I must save her.

158
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:07,777
Please. Please, help me.

159
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:10,215
Of course. Of--of course I'll help.

160
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,292
I want to be free, too.

161
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,525
As luck would have it...

162
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:20,403
I found these on one of
the officers outside.

163
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,680
I think they'll work.

164
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,972
But before I try, I need to
know that you will help me.

165
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,739
Yes. Yes. Of--of course.

166
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:29,931
You'll do anything I ask?

167
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,966
Yes. Yes, anything. Yes, I promise.

168
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,270
Then we're agreed.

169
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:55,959
Thank you.

170
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,517
Of course, my friend.

171
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:01,537
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

172
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:03,488
Thank you.

173
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:08,697
We're gonna have to
get you on your feet.

174
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:18,449
You're gonna need your strength
if we're going to escape.

175
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:19,895
Escape?

176
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,400
That's right.

177
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:25,958
I'm afraid there's only one
way to escape from hell.

178
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:28,478
You're going to have
to kill the devil.

179
00:28:40,723 --> 00:28:42,197
When you're finished eating,

180
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,705
you'll walk due West.

181
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,078
Once you get to the ocean,

182
00:28:47,444 --> 00:28:49,360
you'll be able to see the statue.

183
00:28:50,964 --> 00:28:51,746
The statue?

184
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:54,140
Your ship smashed through
it on its way inland.

185
00:28:54,553 --> 00:28:55,821
Broke it into pieces.

186
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:58,331
That's where you'll find the devil.

187
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:05,730
You only have one chance.

188
00:29:06,723 --> 00:29:07,817
Put this through his chest.

189
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:09,874
Do not hesitate.
Do not let him say a word.

190
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,698
If he speaks,
it will already be too late.

191
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,318
He can be very persuasive.

192
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:18,281
How--how can I kill him with this?

193
00:29:18,318 --> 00:29:20,062
He--he is... black smoke.

194
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:21,136
No.

195
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:23,444
I am.

196
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,841
My wife Isabella...

197
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,179
She was running from you?

198
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,085
She was running from him.

199
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:40,732
I'm sorry. I saw him take her,

200
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,678
but I couldn't do
anything to stop him.

201
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:47,420
But--but if you are
the black smoke, you--

202
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:49,820
you aren't the only one who's
lost something, my friend.

203
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:51,538
The devil betrayed me.

204
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,453
He took my body,

205
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:55,919
my humanity.

206
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:59,376
You--you killed the
officers on the ship.

207
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:01,122
I'm not the one you
need to worry about.

208
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:03,353
The devil has your wife,

209
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,829
and you are going
to have to kill him

210
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:06,491
if you ever want to get her back.

211
00:30:10,819 --> 00:30:13,589
Murder is wrong.
That is what brought me here.

212
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:14,328
My friend...

213
00:30:15,936 --> 00:30:20,584
You and I can talk all day long
about what's right or wrong.

214
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,321
But the question before
you remains the same.

215
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,333
Do you ever want to
see your wife again?

216
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,112
Yes, I do.

217
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:11,341
What are you doing here?
Who gave you this?!

218
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,401
Where is my wife?

219
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,608
What?

220
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,108
Where is my wife?

221
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,941
I-I don't know your wife.

222
00:32:18,974 --> 00:32:22,460
- Did she come here on the ship?
- No. She's dead.

223
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,366
Then why are you
asking me where she is?

224
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,325
Did you meet a man in the
jungle dressed in black?

225
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:35,832
Yes.

226
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:38,198
What did he tell you?

227
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:40,698
He said you are the devil.

228
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,635
And?

229
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,587
He said the only way I
would see my wife again

230
00:32:46,588 --> 00:32:48,110
is if I kill you.

231
00:32:48,588 --> 00:32:50,363
I-I saw her here...

232
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:52,701
In this place. Where is she?!

233
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,295
- That wasn't your wife.
- Yes, it was!

234
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:57,946
- She is dead, just like me.
- You're not dead.

235
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:00,379
I-I am in hell.
I know that I am in hell!

236
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,917
- You really think you're dead?
- Where else would I be?

237
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:06,833
All right then.

238
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:08,767
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

239
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,813
No, no, no, no!

240
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,405
- Still think you're dead?!
- Aah!

241
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:23,813
Aah!

242
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:28,819
- Still think you're dead?!
- Stop!

243
00:33:30,114 --> 00:33:31,767
Why should I stop?!

244
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,842
Because I want to live!

245
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:44,266
That's the first sensible
thing you've said.

246
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:46,163
What's your name?

247
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:47,327
Ricardo.

248
00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,632
Ricardo.

249
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,217
Get up. We need to talk.

250
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:16,504
What is inside?

251
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:18,495
No one comes in unless
I invite them in.

252
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:32,645
Are you the devil?

253
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,901
No.

254
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:44,502
Then who are you?

255
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,436
My name is Jacob.

256
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,648
I'm the one who brought
your ship to this island.

257
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,873
You brought it here?

258
00:34:57,074 --> 00:34:58,468
Why?

259
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,396
Think of this wine as what
you keep calling "hell."

260
00:35:12,649 --> 00:35:14,649
There's many other
names for it, too.

261
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,182
"Malevolence."

262
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:18,040
"Evil."

263
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:19,288
"Darkness."

264
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:23,133
And here it is,
swirling around in the bottle,

265
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:24,082
unable to get out,

266
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,947
because if it did, it would spread.

267
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:30,919
The cork...

268
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:33,093
Is this island.

269
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,064
And it's the only thing
keeping the darkness...

270
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,660
Where it belongs.

271
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,293
That man who sent you to kill me

272
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,789
believes that everyone
is corruptible

273
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:53,569
because 's in their
very nature to sin.

274
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,515
I bring people here
to prove him wrong.

275
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,179
And when they get here,
their past doesn't matter.

276
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:04,107
Before you brought my ship,
there were others?

277
00:36:04,479 --> 00:36:05,536
Yes. Many.

278
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:07,550
- What happened to them?
- They're all dead.

279
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,133
But if you brought them here,
why didn't you help them?

280
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:13,022
Because I wanted them
to help themselves...

281
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:17,384
To know the difference
between right and wrong

282
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:18,883
without me having to tell them.

283
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:22,620
It's all meaningless if I have
to force them to do anything.

284
00:36:23,138 --> 00:36:24,434
Why should I have to step in?

285
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:26,049
If yo don't, he will.

286
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,566
Do you want a job?

287
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:41,457
What? A job?

288
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,752
Doing what?

289
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:47,254
Well...

290
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,207
If I don't want to step in,

291
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,956
maybe you can do it for me.

292
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,418
You can be my...
My representative--

293
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:57,329
an intermediary between
me and the people

294
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:00,456
- I bring to the island.
- Well, what will I get in return?

295
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,603
- You tell me.
- I want my wife back.

296
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,931
Can't do that.

297
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,168
Can you absolve me of my
sins so I don't go to hell?

298
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:16,624
I can't do that either.

299
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,950
Then I never want to die.
I... I want to live forever.

300
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,595
Now that...

301
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:32,575
I can do.

302
00:37:56,057 --> 00:37:58,010
You let him talk to you,
didn't you?

303
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,280
He told me to give you this.

304
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,493
I'm sure you realize
that if you go with him,

305
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:14,673
you'll never be with
your wife again.

306
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:19,376
I understand.

307
00:38:21,038 --> 00:38:22,935
He can be very...

308
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:24,456
Convincing.

309
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:29,895
But I want you to know if
you ever change your mind--

310
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:31,406
and I mean ever...

311
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:34,397
My offer still stands.

312
00:38:41,392 --> 00:38:43,223
I have something for you.

313
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,100
You must have dropped it.

314
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:52,577
I found it on the ship.

315
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:27,605
I've changed my mind.

316
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:34,339
Are you listening to me?

317
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:37,109
I've changed my mind.

318
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,037
I was wrong!

319
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,705
You said I could change my mind.

320
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,143
You said the offer would stand!

321
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:54,650
Does the offer still stand?

322
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:57,705
Does the offer still stand?!

323
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:01,506
Does the offer still stand?!

324
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,853
What offer, dude?

325
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:20,421
What the hell are you doing out here?
Did you follow me?

326
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,553
- Well, kinda.
- Get... get out! Get out!

327
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:23,378
Hey!

328
00:41:23,498 --> 00:41:25,509
Did--didn't you hear what I said?
Look, I was just--

329
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,711
I told you people, I don't know anything!
Dude, just calm down!

330
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,798
Why did you follow me?
Your wife sent me!

331
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,093
What did you say?

332
00:41:35,403 --> 00:41:38,687
I said your wife sent me. Isabella.

333
00:41:41,561 --> 00:41:43,758
She wants to know why
you buried her cross.

334
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,209
H-how do you know about that?

335
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,672
- Because she just told me.
- What do you mean, just told you?

336
00:41:51,048 --> 00:41:53,160
Isabella saw you dig it up, man.

337
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:55,203
She's standing right next to you.

338
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,811
I-I-I don't see her.

339
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,391
She's right there.

340
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,808
She says your English is awesome.

341
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:45,867
Cierra tus ojos.

342
00:42:46,396 --> 00:42:48,396
She wants you to close your eyes.

343
00:42:50,692 --> 00:42:52,514
It's okay. I'll tell
you what she says.

344
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:05,274
No fue tu culpa que yo morir,
ricardo.

345
00:44:01,127 --> 00:44:02,554
Is she gone?

346
00:44:04,122 --> 00:44:05,587
Yeah.

347
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,027
Thank you.

348
00:44:27,593 --> 00:44:29,030
Yeah, you got it.

349
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,027
Something wrong?

350
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,427
Well, she kinda
said one more thing.

351
00:44:38,264 --> 00:44:39,842
Something you have to do.

352
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:41,593
What?

353
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:45,593
She said you have to
stop the man in black.

354
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:48,327
You have to stop him
from leaving the island.

355
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,893
'Cause if you don't...

356
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,674
- Good morning.
- Morning

357
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:46,050
I see you got me a present.

358
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:51,074
Don't gloat, Jacob, doesn't become you.

359
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,433
So you try to kill me?

360
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,169
You expect an apology?

361
00:45:57,373 --> 00:45:57,881
No.

362
00:45:59,263 --> 00:46:00,815
I guess I'm just wondering
why you did it.

363
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:01,987
Because I wanna leave.

364
00:46:02,931 --> 00:46:04,674
Just let me leave, Jacob.

365
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:07,963
As long as I'm alive,
you're not going anywhere.

366
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:09,674
Well, then, now you know
why I wanna kill you.

367
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:11,853
And I will kill you, Jacob.

368
00:46:12,674 --> 00:46:14,553
Even if you do, somebody else
will take my place.

369
00:46:14,673 --> 00:46:16,351
Well, then I'll kill them too.

370
00:46:22,437 --> 00:46:23,674
Here,

371
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:28,068
something for you to pass the time.

372
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:35,353
I'll see you around.

373
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,675
Sooner than you think.

374
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:52,676
