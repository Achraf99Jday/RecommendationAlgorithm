1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,530
Oh, God.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,360
It's not your fault she's dead.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,380
It's mine.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,470
And I convinced her to stay.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,070
Cause I didn't want to be alone.

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,530
You can probably make it back
to the temple by nightfall

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm sorry you had to see me like that.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,920
Hello, Richard.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,670
- You?
- Me.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,370
I am very disappointed in all of you!

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,580
So what were you doing in Australia?

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,040
- Business or pleasure?
- Actually, I went on a walkabout.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,520
Welcome to Los Angeles.

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,830
- Bye, daddy.
- Bye, sweetie.

15
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,810
Oh, come on.

16
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,300
John?

17
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,100
Are you okay?

18
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,280
Yeah. I'm fine.

19
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,770
Come on, let's get you inside.

20
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,710
Okay.

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,980
Well, how long will that take?

22
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,650
The wedding is in October.

23
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,880
Look, I'm gonna just have
to call you back. Yeah.

24
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,890
I am so sick of caterers

25
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,790
and bands

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,130
and picking fabrics for chair backs.

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,090
What do you say we just...

28
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,600
Get my parents and your dad

29
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,300
and do it shotgun style in Vegas?

30
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,500
No. You deserve better than that, Helen.

31
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,920
And we can do this. I know we can.

32
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,380
I like...

33
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,710
This one.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,650
- That one?
- I meant this one.

35
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,330
You are a very sweet man.

36
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,100
I know.

37
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,600
So how was the conference?

38
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,100
Boring.

39
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,170
Who's, uh, who's Dr. Jack Shephard?

40
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,170
Oh, I met him at lost luggage

41
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,540
when I went to fill out the forms.

42
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,910
He... he lost something, too.

43
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,440
He's a spinal surgeon?

44
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,140
Yeah. Nice guy.

45
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,210
He offered me a free consult.

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,250
You should call him.

47
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,650
Oh, he was just being polite, Helen.

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,520
So what?

49
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,660
I mean...

50
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,560
What are the odds of you just
running into a spinal surgeon?

51
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,760
I mean, who knows?

52
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,600
Maybe it's destiny.

53
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,440
Maybe it is.

54
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,720
All right, Richard.

55
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,860
Time to talk.

56
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,240
Noanothertony zueky

57
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,660
Welcome back, colonel.

58
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,290
You got a nice tan in Australia.

59
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,960
Did you miss us?

60
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,900
Sure I did, Randy.

61
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,470
So... how was the conference, John?

62
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,940
Uh, it was okay. I didn't
really learn anything.

63
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,700
No? But, um, I made some
good contacts, though.

64
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,370
Really? That's interesting.

65
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
See, uh, Ken Fisher called

66
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,410
and said you had to
cancel your lunch with him.

67
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,380
Right, right. I was a little
under the weather that day.

68
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,050
- Uh... probably jet lag.
- Really?

69
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,220
'Cause then the seminar people called

70
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,550
and said you hadn't
picked up your credentials.

71
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,420
I did some checking,

72
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,390
and it seems that you
didn't attend a single event.

73
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,500
Since we sent you to Sydney
on the company's dime...

74
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,530
Where the hell were you?

75
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,500
Look, Randy, I'm really sorry. I'm...

76
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,000
Why don't we just call
it my vacation week?

77
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought you wanted that
vacation week in October?

78
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,070
You know, for your wedding.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,140
Please, Randy. I... I
know I shouldn't have lied.

80
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,250
But where I was...

81
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,250
It's personal,

82
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,920
- and I... and I really don't want to talk about it.
- Okay, John.

83
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,430
Hey, you're fired.

84
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,510
Thirsty?

85
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,140
Richard, I'm sorry I hit you in the throat

86
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,810
and dragged you off the beach,
but I had to do something.

87
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,750
- What do you want?
- what I've always wanted...

88
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,450
for you to come with me.

89
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,420
Why do you look like John Locke?

90
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,390
I knew he'd get me access to Jacob.

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,690
Because John's a candidate.

92
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,330
Or at least he was a candidate.

93
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,500
What do you mean...

94
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,940
what do you mean, "a candidate"?

95
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,770
- Didn't Jacob tell you any of this?
- Any of what?

96
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,440
Oh, Richard, I'm sorry.

97
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,310
You mean, you've been
doing everything he told you

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,290
all this time, and he never said why?

99
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,050
I would never have done that to you.

100
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,490
I would never have kept you in the dark.

101
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,020
And... and what would you have done?

102
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,460
I would have treated you with respect.

103
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,090
Come with me,

104
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,340
and I promise I'll tell you everything.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,270
No.

106
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,170
Are you sure about that, Richard?

107
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,170
Because people seldom get a second chance.

108
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,290
I'm not going anywhere with you.

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,090
All right...

110
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,900
what?

111
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,380
I'll be seeing you, Richard,
sooner than you think.

112
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,740
Am I interrupting?

113
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,940
Tell me what happened to them.

114
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,800
All right.

115
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,770
There's a fairly reasonable chance

116
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,850
that you won't believe me.

117
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,580
Try me.

118
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,480
John Locke killed them.

119
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,090
- All by himself?
- Yes.

120
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,690
He turned into a pillar of black smoke,

121
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,160
and he killed them right before my eyes.

122
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,000
Did it kill Jacob as well?

123
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,730
Yes.

124
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,130
Then where's his body?

125
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,610
Locke kicked him into the
fire, and he burned away.

126
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,020
Locke... do you know why

127
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,400
he carried Richard out into the jungle?

128
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,970
He's recruiting.

129
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,450
Hello, James.

130
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,190
I thought you were dead.

131
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,860
I am.

132
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,760
Here's to bein' dead.

133
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,600
You're taking this extremely well.

134
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,810
Taking what extremely well?

135
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,380
That I'm here.

136
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,510
I don't give a damn if you're dead

137
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,750
or time travelin' or...

138
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,180
The ghost of Christmas past.

139
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,650
All I care about is this whiskey.

140
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,720
So bottom's up,

141
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,830
then get the hell out of my house.

142
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,060
This isn't your house, James.

143
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,070
The hell it ain't.

144
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,540
No. You just lived here for a while.

145
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,040
This was never your house.

146
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,440
Who are you?

147
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,310
You sure as hell ain't John Locke.

148
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,120
What makes you say that?

149
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,150
Cause Locke was scared,

150
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,220
even when he was pretending he wasn't.

151
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
But you...

152
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,390
You ain't scared.

153
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,940
What if I told you I was
the person who could answer

154
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,070
the most important question in the world?

155
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,820
And what question is that?

156
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,020
Why are you on this island?

157
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,060
I'm on this island

158
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,430
because my plane crashed,

159
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,630
'cause my raft blew up,

160
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,070
because the helicopter I was
on was ridin' one too heavy.

161
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,640
That's not why you're here.

162
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,010
And if you come with me...

163
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,910
I can prove it.

164
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,120
Well, I guess I better put some pants on.

165
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,140
Okay.

166
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,410
Okay.

167
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,920
Come on!

168
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,120
Aw, damn it!

169
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,490
Dude?

170
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,290
Dude!

171
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,070
What are you doing?

172
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,760
What am I doing? What
the hell are you doing?

173
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,720
You ever park a car in your life?

174
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,000
You're practically in my spot!

175
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,150
I'm sorry. Yeah.

176
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,710
But, you know, there's a
handicap spot right over here.

177
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,710
Yeah. Yeah, okay. But I
don't have to park there.

178
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,750
I can park anywhere I want.

179
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,030
You need to stay inside the lines.

180
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,980
I'm really sorry.

181
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,070
They were supposed to
reserve a spot for me.

182
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,580
So, you know, I just parked here.

183
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,240
I haven't seen you before. You work here?

184
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,200
Actually, I own the company.

185
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,770
Hugo Reyes.

186
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,180
John Locke.

187
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,950
Cool. What do you do here, John?

188
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,380
Uh, actually, nothing.
My boss just fired me.

189
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,350
Oh? Who's your boss?

190
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,350
His name is Randy.

191
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,120
- But, uh...
- Randy Nations?

192
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,860
Yeah. Yes,

193
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,820
yeah, that guy is a huge douche.

194
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:14,160
You want me to talk to him for ya?

195
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,090
No, that's okay.

196
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,600
Tell you what, John.

197
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,970
I own a temp agency, too.

198
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,370
Call this number

199
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,400
and tell 'em that Hugo said

200
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,680
to hook you up with a new job pronto.

201
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,450
And chin up.

202
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,150
Things are gonna work out.

203
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,190
He's gettin' pretty ripe.

204
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,830
Where is everybody?

205
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,000
They left. They said they
were going to the temple.

206
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,360
Right now it's the safest
place on the island.

207
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,510
We should go there, too.

208
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,840
Are you all right?

209
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm fine.

210
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,650
Come on, let's get out of here.

211
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,590
What makes you think
that I'm going with you?

212
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,960
Because you want to find Jin.

213
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,390
What do you know about my husband?

214
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:24,330
I know that if he's on
the island and he's alive,

215
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,970
then he'll be at the temple.

216
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,770
Let's get moving.

217
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,640
What about John?

218
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,580
We need to bury him.

219
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,720
What were you doing alone
in that house, James?

220
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,080
Drinkin'.

221
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,620
Where's the rest of your friends?

222
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,410
Some temple somewhere.

223
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,230
Why aren't you with 'em?

224
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,760
You know what? How
about we just don't talk?

225
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,730
You got it.

226
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,070
Who the hell is that?

227
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,510
You can see him?

228
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,140
The kid? Hell, yeah, I can see him.

229
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,470
you know the rules.

230
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,400
You can't kill him.

231
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,580
Don't tell me what I can't do.

232
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,860
Don't tell me what I can't !

233
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,140
Locke!

234
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,980
Look, whoever you are,
you got about 20 seconds,

235
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,380
and then I'm outta here!

236
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,490
Where is he? What the
hell are you doing here?

237
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,600
Where is he?

238
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,920
Locke? Ran off into the
jungle after some kid.

239
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,760
- We need to go now.
- Go where?

240
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,820
To the temple. Let's go. Les go.

241
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,260
You know what?

242
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,400
I've been to the temple. I
think I'm sticking with Locke.

243
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,500
- That man is not John Locke.
- I know.

244
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,880
Then why are you with him?

245
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Because he's got answers,

246
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,600
says he knows why I am on this island...

247
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,681
unless you wanna tell
me why I'm here, Richard.

248
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,110
Don't be naive. He's not
gonna tell you anything

249
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:41,672
- he's gonna kill you.
- If he wanted to kill me,

250
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,485
he could've done it a dozen times already.

251
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:44,400
You don't understand
what you're dealing with.

252
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:46,556
He doesn't just want you
dead. He wants everyone dead...

253
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:48,903
everyone you care about...  all
of them... and he won't stop...

254
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,190
Who you talking to?

255
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,490
Nobody.

256
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,400
You ever catch up with the kid?

257
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,800
What kid?

258
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Right.

259
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,970
Let's get on with it, shall we?

260
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,470
Yes, James. Let's get on with it.

261
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:21,910
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

262
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,520
Excuse me?

263
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,320
What kind of animal would
you describe yourself as?

264
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,060
Uh... I... I don't know
what that has to do with...

265
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,700
just say whatever comes to mind.

266
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Would you describe
yourself as a people person?

267
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,240
May I speak to your supervisor?

268
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,010
Of course.

269
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,810
I'll go get her.

270
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,120
Good morning, Mr... Locke?

271
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,490
Yeah.

272
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,520
I'm Rose Nadler, the office supervisor.

273
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,420
What can I do for you?

274
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,860
Uh, what you can do, Ms. Nadler,

275
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,830
is spare me the question
about what kind of animal I am

276
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,730
and hopefully place me in a job.

277
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,100
Absolutely.

278
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,570
What kind of placement
are you looking for?

279
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,240
Well, I see here

280
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,940
that you have a listing
for a site coordinator.

281
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,210
Construction site coordinator.

282
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,340
Uh, I'm not sure that's a good match.

283
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,860
Well, if experience
is the issue, I have...

284
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,710
experience isn't the issue.

285
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,120
Look, Mr. Reyes told me

286
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,020
if I came down here, I
would be taken care of.

287
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,020
And Mr. Reyes is my
boss, so if he said that,

288
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,990
I can make it happen of you.

289
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,460
If you want to work
construction, you got it.

290
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,400
- Thank you.
- I'm not finished.

291
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,730
I will send you down there tomorrow,

292
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,800
and then the day after,

293
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,270
you will be back in my office.

294
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,110
Look...

295
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,580
Mr. Locke, let's try to
be a little more realistic.

296
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,950
And what do you know about realistic?

297
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,350
I have cancer.

298
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,220
Terminal cancer.

299
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,490
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,890
When the doctors first told me,

301
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,100
I had a hard time accepting it.

302
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,870
But eventually, I got past the denial part

303
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:26,770
and I got back to living
whatever life I've got left.

304
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,410
So...

305
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,780
How about we find you a job

306
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,010
you can do?

307
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,090
Do you read?

308
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,360
Excuse me?

309
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,330
Books. You read books?

310
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,160
Sure. Who doesn't?

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,230
My favorite's Steinbeck,
"of mice and men."

312
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,900
You know that one?

313
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,600
Nope. A little after my time.

314
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,980
It's about these two
guys, George and Lennie.

315
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,180
Lennie's kind of slow,

316
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,910
causing George problems.

317
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,380
So George walks him out in the woods,

318
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,920
tells him to look out yonder and picture

319
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,890
the pretty little house
they're gonna live in one day.

320
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,360
And he shoots Lennie
in the back of the head.

321
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,260
Well, that doesn't sound
like a happy ending.

322
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,000
What's on your mind, James?

323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,770
I'm wondering what would happen to you

324
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,370
if I put a bullet in your head.

325
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,880
Mm. Why don't we find out?

326
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,820
What are you?

327
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,820
What I am is trapped.

328
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,730
And I've been trapped for so long

329
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,060
that I don't even remember
what it feels like to be free.

330
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,200
Maybe you can understand that.

331
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,000
But before I was trapped, I was a man,

332
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,770
James, just like you.

333
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,270
I have a hard time believing that.

334
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,110
Well, you can believe whatever
you want, but that's the truth.

335
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:11,980
I know what it's like to feel joy,

336
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,780
to feel pain, anger, fear...

337
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,720
To experience betrayal.

338
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,190
I know what it's like
to lose someone you love.

339
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,690
If you wanna shoot me, shoot me.

340
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,960
But you're so close, James.

341
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,130
It would be such a shame to turn back now.

342
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,530
Why did you have to bring him
to the statue in the first place?

343
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,200
Because the people there

344
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,640
need to see the face of
what they're up against.

345
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,570
And what's to stop what they're up against

346
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,270
from changing his face?

347
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,810
He can't. Not anymore.

348
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,840
He's stuck this way.

349
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,230
Does anyone want to say anything?

350
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,600
Didn't any of you know him?

351
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,410
All right, I knew him.

352
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,980
John Locke was a...

353
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,590
A believer. He was a man of faith.

354
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,090
He was...

355
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,330
a much better man...

356
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,800
than I will ever be...

357
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,100
and I'm very sorry I murdered him.

358
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,150
This is the weirdest damn funeral

359
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,850
I've ever been to.

360
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,270
Hello. Dr. Shephard's office.

361
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,610
Hello?

362
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,240
Can I help you?

363
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,610
No. No, you can't.

364
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,950
Who was that on the phone?

365
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,380
No one.

366
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,580
No one? Mm-hmm.

367
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,720
John, I just heard you
talking on the phone.

368
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,520
I was, uh,

369
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,130
I was calling Dr. Shephard.

370
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,300
Well, good for you. When
are you gonna see him?

371
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,770
I'm not gonna see him.

372
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,430
Well, I... I don't understand.

373
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,390
Why wouldn't you want...

374
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,270
I got fired, Helen.

375
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,550
Coming!

376
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,550
Madam? Oceanic courier.

377
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,290
I'm delivering your lost luggage.

378
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,320
All right.

379
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,190
Sign here to accept the delivery.

380
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,360
- Thanks.
- Okay, thanks.

381
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,510
Okay, John.

382
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,440
Now talk to me.

383
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,750
How did you get fired?

384
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,760
I lied to Randy.

385
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,320
I didn't go to the conference in Sydney.

386
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,860
What?

387
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,820
Open the case, Helen.

388
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,050
W... what are these for?

389
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,420
My walkabout.

390
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,760
Your... y... your what?

391
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,360
My walkabout.

392
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,660
An adventure in the outback...

393
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,330
man against nature.

394
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,130
But they wouldn't let me go.

395
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,540
And... and I sat there yelling at them,

396
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,200
shouting at them,

397
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,540
that they couldn't
tell me what I can't do.

398
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,610
But they were right.

399
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
I'm sick of imagining

400
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,320
what my life could be
out of this chair, Helen,

401
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,890
what it would be like to...

402
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,830
Walk down the aisle with you.

403
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,560
Cause it's not gonna happen.

404
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,330
So if you need me to see more doctors,

405
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,770
if, uh... have more consults,

406
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,600
if you need me to get out of this chair,

407
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,240
I don't blame you.

408
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,640
But I don't want you to spend your life

409
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,110
waiting for a miracle, Helen, because...

410
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,780
There is no such thing.

411
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,630
There are miracles, John.

412
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,570
And the only thing...

413
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,440
I was ever waiting for...

414
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,980
Was you.

415
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,440
Nice view.

416
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,740
Now what?

417
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,780
Now we go down.

418
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,250
Down where?

419
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,080
Down there.

420
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,220
No offense, but you already died,

421
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,990
so it's great that this
is not a big deal for you.

422
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,930
But if you think I'm
climbing down there first,

423
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,890
you are off your damn nut.

424
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,130
It's no problem. I'll go first.

425
00:32:32,880 --> 00:33:01,680
You coming, James?

426
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,000
James!

427
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,630
Locke!

428
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,000
Jump. I got you. Come on!

429
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,840
Come on, I got you! Come on!

430
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,280
Come on!

431
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,480
Come on!

432
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,750
Look out!

433
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,520
What is this place?

434
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,940
What the hell's that all about?

435
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,240
Inside joke.

436
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,810
So this is what you wanted me to see...

437
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,680
a hole in the cliff with
some rocks on the scale?

438
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,580
That's why I'm here?

439
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,520
No.

440
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,340
That's why you're here.

441
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:20,610
That, James, is why you're all here.

442
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,660
All right, dig it out.
Come on. All the way.

443
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,970
No cheating. Come on,
now. Come on, all the way.

444
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,800
You can catch 'em. You can catch 'em.

445
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,770
Come on, dig it out.

446
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,310
Bring it in now. Bring it in all the way.

447
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,980
Good job. Good job.

448
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,750
All right, everyone!

449
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,790
Please open your
textbooks to chapter four.

450
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,590
Today we are going to talk about...

451
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,190
The human reproductive system.

452
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,170
Do you know where the teach...

453
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,500
excuse me. Can you tell me
where the teachers' lounge is?

454
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,940
- Yeah, it's over there.
- Thank you.

455
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,810
All right, I know I sound
like a broken record,

456
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,150
but how many times do
we have to go over this?

457
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,880
If you have the last cup of coffee,

458
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,920
you remove the filter

459
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,590
and throw it away.

460
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,020
Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.

461
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,230
Actually, I was just
hoping for some Earl Grey.

462
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,160
Tea?

463
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,860
Now there's a gentleman's drink.

464
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't believe we've met.

465
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,900
Ben Linus. European history.

466
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,220
John Locke. Substitute.

467
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,270
Well, welcome.

468
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,650
Who wrote all this?

469
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,620
His name was Jacob.

470
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,520
"Was" Jacob?

471
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,290
He died yesterday.

472
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:25,140
You don't seem too upset about it.

473
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,100
I'm not.

474
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,510
Why are all the names crossed out?

475
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,680
They're not all crossed out.

476
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,580
"Shephard".

477
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,390
That'd be Jack Shephard?

478
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,640
And he's not the only one.

479
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,670
"Reyes".

480
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,970
That's Hugo, right?

481
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,680
What's the 8 about?

482
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,890
Jacob had a thing for numbers.

483
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,010
"16. Jarrah".

484
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,190
"42. Kwon". I don't know
if it's Sun or if it's Jin.

485
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,490
Here. "4. Locke".

486
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,150
I think both know him.

487
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,830
Last but not least...

488
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,570
"Number 15. Ford".

489
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,840
That would be you.

490
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,040
Why would he write my name on this wall?

491
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,390
I never even met the guy.

492
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,750
Oh, no, I'm sure you did meet Jacob.

493
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,260
At some point in your life, James,

494
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,120
probably when you were young,

495
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,890
when you were miserable and
vulnerable, he came to you.

496
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,520
He manipulated you,

497
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,090
pulled your strings
like you were a puppet.

498
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,930
And as a result, choices
that you thought you made

499
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,700
were never really choices at all.

500
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,830
He was pushing you, James.

501
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,200
Pushing you...

502
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,940
To the island.

503
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,740
Why the hell would he do that?

504
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,780
Because you're a candidate.

505
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,410
Candidate for what?

506
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,750
He thought he was the
protector of this place.

507
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,050
And you, James, have been nominated...

508
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,190
To take over that job.

509
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,720
What does that mean?

510
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,690
It means you've got three choices.

511
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,930
First, you can do nothing and...

512
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,270
See how all this plays out.

513
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,640
And possibly,

514
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,370
your name...

515
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,970
Will get crossed out.

516
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,480
Second option,

517
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,180
you can accept the job,

518
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,980
become the new Jacob
and protect the island.

519
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,350
Protect it from what?

520
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,750
From nothing, James.

521
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,390
That's the joke.

522
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,390
There's nothing to protect it from.

523
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,290
It's just a damn island.

524
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,230
And it will be perfectly
fine without Jacob or you

525
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:24,840
or any of the other people
whose lives he wasted.

526
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,310
You said there were three choices.

527
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:35,310
The third choice, James,
is that we just go.

528
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,880
We just get the hell off this island

529
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,190
and we never look back.

530
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,850
And how do we do that?

531
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,320
Together.

532
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,470
So what do you say, James?

533
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:03,240
Are you ready to go home?

534
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,350
Hell, yes.

535
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:23,316
