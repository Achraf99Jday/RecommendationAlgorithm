00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,266
They come. They fight.

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:07,767
They destroy. They corrupt.

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:10,103
It always ends the same.

5
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,771
It only ends once.

6
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,308
Anything that happens
before that is just progress.

7
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,317
I'm not gonna
kill jacob, ben.

8
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,172
<i>You are.</i>

9
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:23,159
Do what I asked you to, ben, I
want you to understand one thing.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,796
You have a choice.

11
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:35,657
(weakly) they're coming.

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,394
The dharma folks
at the swan worksite--

13
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,397
They're gonna
drill into the ground

14
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:43,098
And accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

15
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,400
I think I can
negate that energy.

16
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:49,736
I'm gonna detonate a hydrogen bomb. If we
can do what faraday said, plane never crashes.

17
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,671
Flight 815
lands in los angeles.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,008
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waitin' for?!

19
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,811
(drill whirring)

20
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:08,187
(thud, metal clanks, steam
hisses) we hit the pocket!

21
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:12,127
(buzzing, magnetic humming)

22
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:13,630
Aah!

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,334
Aah!

25
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,536
I got you. No, don't let go! Aah!

26
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,373

27
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,675

No! No, come on!

00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,159
Come on!

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,895
Come on, you son of a bitch!

34
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,404
So how's the drink?

35
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,473
Uh...

36
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,641
It's good.

37
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:22,044
That's not
a very strong reaction.

38
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,013
Well, it's--it's not
a very strong drink. (chuckles)

39
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:30,853
Don't tell anyone.
It'll be our secret.

<i>My husband said the planes
want to stay in the air.</i>

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,845
(chuckles)
sounds like a smart man.

48
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,781
You be sure and tell him that

49
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,484
When he gets back
from the bathroom.

50
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,687
Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

(lowered voice) remind me
to hold it next time, will ya?

65
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,076

(seat belt clicks)

67
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,414
Now I know how the laundry feels
when it's in the dryer. (chuckles)

I missed you.

Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry,
mate. Is this your seat?

72
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,110
The stewardess said it was
empty. No. No, I'm at the window.

00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,678
Oh, right.
(unlatches seat belt)

74
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,619
Listen, mate,
do you mind if I sit here?

75
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,489
It's just the fella next to me
has been snoring

76
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,525
Ever since we took off from
sydney. (chuckles) yeah, no problem.

77

Thanks, brother.

That our plane would never
crash on this island! Stop it!

00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,757
What do you think
I'm gonna do,

166
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,126
Stab you and run?

167
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,895
Hey, watch we're you're going,
buddy.

168
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,768
Sorry. My bad.

169
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,806
(man) say it.
Come on, please? Just once.

170
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,641
I really don't want to, dude.
I love those commercials.

171
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,642
Come on.
Just do the australian accent,

172
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,643
And I'll leave you alone.

173
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,411
All right.
Fine. All right.

174
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,980
(australian accent) oi!
Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!

175
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:14,050
(laughing)

176
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,018
You know who this is?

177
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,921
This is--this is the owner
of mr. Cluck's chicken.

178
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,922
And he's--and he's back here
riding coach

179
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:24,325
With the rest of us yutzes!
Huh? (laughs) how about th?

180
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,594
Hey, um,
do you mind me asking,

181
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,529
How exactly did a guy like you
get to o a major corporation?

182
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,531
I won the lottery
and I like chicken,

183
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,533
So I bought it.

184
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,801
Oh. Good.

185
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,669
Good for you.

186
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,340
You know, you really shouldn't
tell people you won the lottery.

187
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,342
Yeah? Why not?

188
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,645
Cause they'll take advantage
of you. That's why not.

189
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,815
Thanks for the advice, dude,
but it's not gonna happen.

190
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,285
It's not, huh?

191
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,520
Nope. Nothing bad
ever happens to me.

192
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:00,956
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

193
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,434
(loudly) what just happened?

194
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,036
I found a flashlight.

195
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:18,272
Dude, who cares? The sky
just went from day to night.

196
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,707
What happened?!
I think we moved through time.

197
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,509
How do you know that?

198
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,844
White flash. Headache.
Can't hear.

199
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:28,314
Happened to me before. What
about jack and everyone else?

200
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,217
Did they move through
time, too? I don't know.

201
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,685
They took one of the other vans
and went up to the worksite.

202
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,687
(sawyer shouts indistinctly)
and then I heard gunfire--

203
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,755
<i>Shh! You said that our plane
would never crash on this island!</i>

204
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:42,391
You hear that, dude? It's
sawyer. Stay here with sayid.

205
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,693
(sawyer shouting indistinctly)

206
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,695
The bomb must've gone off.

207
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,497
You think an atom bomb went off,
we'd still be standing here?!

208
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,567
I don't know.

209
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:53,970
<i>That's right! You don't!
For once, you don't know!</i>

210
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,339
(jin) jack!

211
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,974
Sayid needs help.

212
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,441
Where is he?
With hurley at the van.

213
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,476
Two minutes away.
(muffled, weak voice) help.

214
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,512
He's still bleeding.
We don't know what to do.

215
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,481
Help me.

216
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:11,081
So what do you say,
doc?

217
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:13,450
Got another great idea
to save sayid?

218
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:16,352
Maybe there's a nuke
laying around. Hey, shut up!

219
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,558
Help.

220
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:28,229
<i>Juliet!</i>

221
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,530
James?

222
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,564
Oh, my god.

223
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,933
Juliet!

224
00:15:36,837 --> 00:15:38,403
(coughs and gags)

225
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,271
Oh, god.
Oh, god, this is gross.

226
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,339
(coughing and gagging)

227
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,242
(wheezing)

228
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,809
Don't worry, dude.

229
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,543
Everything's gonna be fine.

230
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,879
(weakly) when I die...

231
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,381
(groans)

232
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,784
What do you think
will happen to me?

233
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,786
Just--just try
not to talk, dude.

234
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,823
(inhales sharply) I've tortured
more people than I can remember.

235
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,128
I murdered.

236
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,731
Wherever I'm going...

237
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,732
(whispers)
it can't be very pleasant.

238
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,301
Sayid, come on.
I deserve it.

239
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:21,007
(leaves rustling)

240
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,008
(rustling stops)
hello?

241
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:28,213
Jin?

242
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,182
(wheezes)

243
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,450
Jin!

244
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,918
(leaves rustle)

245
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,452
I've got a gun!
(rustling stops)

246
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,887
And I know how to shoot it!

247
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:54,996
(leaves rustle)

248
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,531
(rustling stops)

249
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,737
(leaves rustling)

250
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,911
Hello, hugo.

251
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:14,148
You got a minute?

252
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,373
(speaks indistinctly)

253
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,008
(both chuckle)

254
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:29,309
(speaks korean)

255
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,211
(speaks korean)

256
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,431
You're wasting your time,
man.

257
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,134
This plane goes down
in the ocean way out here,

258
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,870
I think our chances of survival
are exactly zero.

259
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,973
Actually, in calm seas
w-with a good pilot,

260
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:05,241
We could survive
a water landing.

261
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,410
And, uh, the fuel tanks
are buoyant enough

262
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,778
To keep us afloat until
we got in the life rafts.

263
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,147
What?

264
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,148
No, it's just impressive
you know that.

265
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,484
What were you doing
in australia?

266
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,853
Business or pleasure?

267
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,088
Pleasure. You?

268
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:26,157
I went down to get my sister
out of a bad relationship

269
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:30,126
That it turns out
she didn't want to get out of.

270
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:31,627
So...

271
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,561
Here I am.

272
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:36,765
So what, you were
just down under for vacation?

273
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,468
Actually,
I went on a walkabout.

274
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,237
Really?

275
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,638
Like--like crocodile dundee?

276
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,472
(chuckles) no, not exactly.

277
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,507
But--but, uh,
it was pretty intense.

278
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,309
We--we spent ten days
in the outback

279
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,943
And, uh, nothing but our packs
and our knives.

280
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,779
We slept under the stars
and made our own fires,

281
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,514
Hunted our own food.

282
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,049
Wow.

283
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:04,886
I wouldn't make it two days
without my cell phone.

284
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,354
(both chuckle)

285
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,722
You're not pulling my leg,
are ya?

286
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,425
Why would I pull your leg?

287
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,326
(chuckles)

288
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,929
This thing goes down,
I'm sticking with you.

289
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,766
(fire crackling)

290
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,812
(cuts material)

291
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:51,424
You can stop staring
at the fire.

292
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,096
Jacob's gone.

293
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,331
He's gone.

294
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,767
Why didn't he fight back?

295
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,105
Why did he
let me just kill him?

296
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,540
I guess he knew
that he was beaten.

297
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,912
Ben...

298
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,881
I want you to go outside

299
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,818
And tell richard
that I need to talk to him.

300
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,720
Talk to him about... What?

301
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,822
That's between me and richard.

302
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:33,329
There's no other reason. (bram)
no, that's not how it's gonna be.

303
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,932
You have to--you're not going
in there. (speaks indistinctly)

304
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,301
(speaks indistinctly) listen to me.
I already did. Now I'm asking you to...

305
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,470
(speaks indistinctly)
body over by the...

306
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,737
(speaks indistinctly)

307
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:44,739
Just back up a little.
Okay?

308
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,441
(richardnd bram
speaking indistinctly)

309
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,907
Who are they?

310
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,906
Other than the fact

311
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:53,607
That I know they were
on the ajira flight with us,

312
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,641
All I know is
they knocked me out

313
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,442
And dragged my ass
to some cabin,

314
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,178
Which they promptly burned,
then...

315
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,780
Brought me here along with
the dead guy in the box.

316
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:06,481
They say
they're the good guys.

317
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,883
(both speaking indistinctly)

318
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,285
I'm not buying it either.

319
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:16,824
Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me,
and listen carefully.

320
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,594
No one goes in there
unless jacob invites them in.

321
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:22,764
Richard, that's why we're here,
because jacob invited us.

322
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:25,532
Asking me what's
in the shadow of the damn statue

323
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,901
Doesn't mean you're in charge.
Then who is?

324
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,969
Richard. (panting)

325
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,571
Ben.

326
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,873
What happened in there?

327
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,575
Everything's fine.

328
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,943
John wants to speak to you.

329
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,711
Is jacob all right?
I'm sorry. Who are you?

330
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:43,714
Answer her question, ben. Well,
of course jacob's all right.

331
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:47,650
They're both together inside.
John just wants to talk to you.

332
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,486
John wants to talk to me?
That's right.

333
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,489
Richard, what are you doing?
I don't understand.

334
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,991
Well, I'm happy
to talk to john.

335
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,960
But before I do, maybe you
should talk to him first.

336
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,601
(all grunting)

337
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,110
Hang on, juliet!
We're coming!

338
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,581
(kate) uhh!

339
00:22:26,616 --> 00:22:28,250
(grunts)

340
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,154
Jin. Flashlight.

341
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:40,124
We can move this beam.
I think I can get down there.

342
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,667
Uhh!

343
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:51,735
(groans)

344
00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,570
(grunts)

345
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,873
Uhh! Too heavy. We need
something to pull it. Jin!

346
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:00,441
The van! There's chains in it.
Go get 'em!

347
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,519
Where you going, dude?

348
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,455
And what are you
doing here?

349
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,490
I mean,
I meet you in a taxi,

350
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,558
And you know everything
about me,

351
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,526
And you give me a plane ticket,

352
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,028
Which just so happens
to get me back on this island.

353
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:26,130
How'd you know
that was gonna happen?

354
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:33,571
Can you hear me? Why aren't you
answering my questions?

355
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,407
Look, my friend jin's
gonna be here any second,

356
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:41,510
So you better stop ignoring me-- your
friend jin won't be able to see me.

357
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,446
Why not?
Because I died an hour ago.

358
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,113
Sorry, dude. That sucks.

359
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,214
Thanks.

360
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:51,483
How'd you die?

361
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:55,352
I was killed by an old friend
who grew tired of my company.

362
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,459
You want me to do something
crazy again, don't you?

363
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:05,028
No. I need you
to save sayid, hugo.

364
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,431
Well, that's why jin went to go
get jack, to-- jin can't help him.

365
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:11,334
You need to take sayid
to the temple.

366
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,371
That's the only chance
he's got.

367
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,040
And the rest of them
will be safe there.

368
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:17,443
The temple? I'm supposed
to know what that is?

369
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,644
Jin knows.

370
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:21,713
Tell him to take you
to the hole in the wall

371
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,715
Where he was
with the french team.

372
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:25,416
Through that opening,
you can get into the temple.

373
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:29,120
You still have
that guitar case I gave you?

374
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,154
Yeah.

375
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,622
Bring it.

376
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:36,259
Who are you, dude?

377
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:37,661
I'm jacob.

378
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,566
(leaves rustle)

379
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,268
Hurley!

380
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:47,669
Help me with sayid.

381
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,671
We have to get him into the van.
Juliet needs our help.

382
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,539
Come on! We have to go!

383
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,781
Jin, if I asked you

384
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:06,415
To take me to where
there's like a he in the wall,

385
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,316
Where you went
with the french team,

386
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,219
Would you know
what I was talking about?

387
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,020
Yes.

388
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,721
Good.

389
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:18,957
(van approaching)

390
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,731
I'll get the chain.

391
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:29,334
(tools clatter)

392
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,602
Juliet?

393
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:32,170
Stop it. Stop, sawyer.

394
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:34,806
The van is here.
The chains are comin'.

395
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:43,445
(chain rattles)

396
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:47,348
She ain't makin' any more noises. She knows
we're here. She's probably just resting.

397
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:48,683
Juliet!

398
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:57,691
If she dies, I'll kill him.

399
00:25:57,725 --> 00:26:00,626
(chain rattles)

400
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,195
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
nothing to be alarmed about,</i>

401
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,095
<i>But if there is a doctor
on board</i>

402
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,664
Would you please press
your call button?

403
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,766
(bell dings)

404
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,102
Sir, you're a doctor?
Yes.

405
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:20,039
Could you come with me, please?
We appreciate your help.

406
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:22,074
A passenger went
into the restroom

407
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,343
About half an hour ago, and he's
not responding when we knock.

408
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,912
This man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in
there-- I-I think he tampered with the lock.

409
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,380
It's--it's jammed or something.
I don't know.

410
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,883
Can I be of assistance?
Excuse me.

411
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:36,919
(door bangs)

412
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,862
He's not breathing.

413
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,666
What's goin' on
back there, earhart?

414
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,436
Yeah, everything's fine, sir. Please just
stay in your seat. - Yeah. Looks peachy.

415
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,271
Sir, I'm gonna need
your help. - What can I do?

416
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:05,606
I need you...

417
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,908
Hold this over
his no and mouth.

418
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:10,910
Hold it there, and do not
let any air escape. Okay. Now?

419
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:13,212
Yes, now.

420
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,582
(sighs) something's blocking
his air passage.

421
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:25,388
(grunts) we have to open it up.

422
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:27,789
I need, uh, something sharp--
a razor.

423
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,359
I got a pen.
A pen?

424
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:34,928
It's regulation. There's
nothing sharp. A pen! Just a pen.

425
00:27:34,962 --> 00:27:38,064
I had a pen in my jacket
but it's gone.

426
00:27:38,098 --> 00:27:39,365
Damn it.

427
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:43,535
(grunt

428
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:48,005
(strained voice)
I got it. I got it.

429
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,539
(sighs deeply)

430
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:51,108
(panting)

431
00:27:51,142 --> 00:27:53,676
(coughing)

432
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,577
(gasping)

433
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:59,114
Relax. Just relax.
Breathe.

434
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:03,684
(breathing heavily)

435
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:05,052
I'm alive?

436
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:08,755
(chuckles) yeah.
Ah, you're alive.

437
00:28:10,992 --> 00:28:12,525
Terrific.

438
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:19,363
(chain rattling)

439
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,739
Got it? Okay, jin! We're good down here!

440
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,310
(starts engine)
hit it!

441
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,345
(revs engine)

442
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:43,854
(all grunting)

443
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,322
(revs engine)

444
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,059
Give me the flashlight.

445
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:55,430
(metal clanking)

446
00:28:55,464 --> 00:28:58,599
(panting)

447
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,601
(grunts)

448
00:29:08,508 --> 00:29:10,408
Juliet.

449
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:15,612
(metal clanks)

450
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:18,549
Okay. (panting)

451
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,818
Juliet. Come here. Okay.

452
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:22,252
(metal clanks)

453
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:24,154
Juliet?

454
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:25,488
(sets down flashlight)

455
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:28,457
Juliet, hey.
I'm here. Come on, baby.

456
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:30,192
Hey, come on, wake up.

457
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,460
Wake up.

458
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:37,463
Hi.

459
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,698
Hey.

460
00:29:39,732 --> 00:29:41,866
(chuckles)

461
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,600
Okay.

462
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:47,570
Where... Where...
Where are we?

463
00:29:47,604 --> 00:29:50,172
Don't worry about that.
You're fine.

464
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,374
I gotta get you
out of here, okay?

465
00:29:57,579 --> 00:30:00,080
It didn't work.

466
00:30:00,114 --> 00:30:02,181
We're still on the island.

467
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:05,017
It's okay. It's okay.

468
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,853
I just gotta get this loose
enough to get you out, okay?

469
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:11,655
I need to get you-- no, I hit
the bomb. You're still here.

470
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,823
You what?

471
00:30:13,858 --> 00:30:17,026
You hit the bomb?

472
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,294
Why?

473
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:23,330
(whispers) I wanted you
to be able to go home.

474
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,264
(crying) I wanted to make it

475
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:27,732
So that you never came
to this damn isld.

476
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,736
And it didn't work.

477
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,639
Shh.

478
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:34,241
Don't you worry about that.

479
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,643
You're gonna be okay.

480
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:40,579
I'm gonna get you
outta here,

481
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:42,881
And we're all gonna go home
together. You hear me?

482
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:45,483
Sawyer?

483
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,994
Even if I could get the bullet
out, the bleeding won't stop.

484
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:02,297
There's nothing
I can do for him.

<i>There's something I can do.</i>

486
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:07,034
There's a temple.

487
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:09,403
If we can get sayid there,
we can save him.

488
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:13,305
<i>And you know this how? This guy
jacob told me just before we got here.</i>

489
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,539
Who's jacob?

490
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,708
Does it matter?
Can you fix sayid, jack?

491
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:21,511
No.

492
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:24,346
Then you're gonna
have to let me do it.

493
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:30,485
(surf rolling)

494
00:31:32,754 --> 00:31:34,722
Ben, you need to talk to me.

495
00:31:34,756 --> 00:31:37,657
I-I can't stop them unless you
tell me what happened in there,

496
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:39,292
What happened to jacob.

497
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:44,662
You and I have known each other
for 30 years, ben.

498
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,164
I'm asking you this
as a friend.

499
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:50,067
You wanna know what happened,
richard?

500
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,704
Why don't you go inside
and find out?

501
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:02,377
What are you doing?

502
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:05,313
We're goin' in,
and he's comin' with us.

503
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:20,659
Where's richard?

504
00:32:20,693 --> 00:32:23,528
He's not coming.

505
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,197
Then who is that behind you?

506
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:36,640
Where's jacob?

507
00:32:36,674 --> 00:32:38,541
Jacob is dead.
(cocks gun)

508
00:32:41,577 --> 00:32:43,545
Who are you?

509
00:32:43,579 --> 00:32:45,480
Don't worry about me.
(knife clatters)

510
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:47,448
Let's talk about you.

511
00:32:47,482 --> 00:32:51,251
I'm assuming that you are...
What, jacob's bodyguards,

512
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:54,421
And that you came all the way
to this island to protect him?

513
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:56,522
Well, I have good news.

514
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,392
Jacob burned up
right there in that fire.

515
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:04,395
Therefore there's nothing left
for you to protect. You can go.

516
00:33:05,863 --> 00:33:08,164
You're free.

517
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,200
(gunfire)

518
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:13,702
Kill him!

519
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,670
Spread out! Get him!

520
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,008
(bram) where is he?!

521
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:37,023

Aah! (grunts)

(rattling and growling stop)

533
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,547
I'm sorry you had to see me
like that.

534

535
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:28,519
Is she okay?

536
00:35:28,554 --> 00:35:30,623

EstÃÂ¡bien, te tengo.
I got you. Okay.

It's okay. I got you.
(groans) okay.

We should get coffee
some time.

552
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,199
I gotta get you out of here.

553
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,867
We can go dutch.

00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,310
It's me.

(sighs deeply)

563

I have to tell you
something.

564
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:59,276
It's really, really
important.

565
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:05,915
You tell me.

566
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:08,684
Tell me.

567
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,320
Julie?

568
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:18,791

You did this.

575
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,431
You should've
let that happen, man.

576
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:13,332
I was supposed to die.

577
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,201
Don't take it personally.

578
00:38:18,236 --> 00:38:21,569

how to say thanks.

Excuse me, do you know
what happened

581
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,111
To the guy that was sitting
next to me? Oh, we were asleep.

We gonna sing "kumbaya"

It's not a guitar, man.

Hi. Uh...

00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,612
I'm jack shephard.
I was just paged.

618
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:50,414
Oh, mr. Shephard.

619
00:44:50,448 --> 00:44:52,349
Hello. Yes, that was me.

620
00:44:52,383 --> 00:44:54,817
Uh, sorry, I meant
to meet you at the gate.

621

Well, um, I'm here now,
so--

622
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,153
Yes. Mr. Shephard,
I am deeply sorry,

623
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:01,155
But there seems
to have been a mix-up

624
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:03,923
Involving the, uh... Cargo
you checked in sydney.

625
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,592
Cargo?

626
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:07,795
Yes,ir. A coffin.

627
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,131
I don't... (sighs)

628
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,699
I don't understand.

629
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,235
I mean, are--are you saying
that it's not here?

630
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:16,603
It appears it was never
put on the plane.

(sighs)

632
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:22,975
The funeral is in two hours.
When is it getting here?

633
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,944
Mr. Shephard, I can't tell you
how deeply sorry we are.

634
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:28,413
But we don't know
when it will arrive...

635
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,949
Because we're not exactly sure
where it is.

(birds chirping)

637

How are we gonna get him
over the top?

639
00:46:03,475 --> 00:46:07,410
We're not. We're bringing him
in through here.

Who brings a book into a cave?

643
00:46:48,855 --> 00:46:51,622
And why is his arm missing?

644
00:46:51,657 --> 00:46:55,426
It was ripped off when he was
attacked by the black smoke.

645
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,898
Well... This is gonna
be awesome.

I can't hold it.

What was it, miles?

732

That's why you asked me
to stay here with you?

Across the ocean
and, like, through time,

797

So I wanna know
what that paper says.

798

That paper said that if
your friend there dies...

We're all
in a lot of trouble.

00:59:40,353 --> 00:59:42,454
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me.

814
00:59:42,488 --> 00:59:44,422
Let's go have a talk--

815
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:46,357
This way.

816
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:50,059
Anne, taer
to the waiting area.

817
00:59:50,094 --> 00:59:51,227
Ms. Paik?

818
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:53,562
Do you understand
any english?

819
00:59:53,596 --> 00:59:55,130
Because if you do,

820
00:59:55,164 --> 00:59:57,598
If this is just
a misunderstanding,

821
00:59:57,633 --> 00:59:59,766
You should speak up now.

822
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:04,135
Do you understand me?

823
01:00:07,673 --> 01:00:10,608
No... English.

824
01:00:31,563 --> 01:00:34,165
(water gurgling)

825
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,102
The water isn't clear.

826
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,370
What happened?

827
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,539
(speaks japanese)

828
01:01:19,804 --> 01:01:21,705
What is he doing?

829
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:23,339
I don't know.

830
01:01:29,945 --> 01:01:33,013
(speaks japanese)

831
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:34,948
Who did this to him?

832
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:39,851
It's my fault. I-I didn't
shoot him, but it's my fault.

833
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:42,987
(speaking japanese)

834
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:47,991
If we do this,
there are risks.

835
01:01:52,563 --> 01:01:54,197
You understand?

836
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:57,166
Do what you have to do.

837
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:03,405
(speaks japanese)

838
01:02:03,439 --> 01:02:06,107
Take off the coveralls,
put him in.

839
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:45,805
What are they doing?

840
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:50,842
Can unconscious people
hold their breath? - No.

841
01:03:00,051 --> 01:03:02,686
He's awake. Let him up.

842
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,059
What are they waiting for?

843
01:03:11,628 --> 01:03:12,895
That's enough!

844
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:17,198
I said let him up!

845
01:03:22,504 --> 01:03:25,372
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

846
01:04:30,722 --> 01:04:32,722
(speaks japanese)

847
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:37,627
Your friend is dead.

848
01:04:39,262 --> 01:04:42,098
(exhales deeply)

849
01:05:14,624 --> 01:05:15,791

850
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:17,359
Jack.

851
01:05:18,895 --> 01:05:20,829
Jack, stop what
you're doing.

852
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:33,639
Jack, he's dead.

853
01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:38,243
He's not coming back.
Stop it!

Well, it should've cleared.

875
01:07:27,155 --> 01:07:29,590
Outback's just a name.

What are they saying,
they own the entire outback?

She's gonna

Go! Go now!

886
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:01,612
Lady, I already have
a customer.

887
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:03,347

something to eat or drink.

Zack, emma, then take the rest
to the people over there.

Thank you.

(footsteps approach)

01:08:50,923 --> 01:08:53,458
Hey. What happened?
(gasps

898
01:08:53,492 --> 01:08:57,027
(panting) they jumped us
in the jungle.

899
01:08:57,062 --> 01:08:59,363
He took four of them out

900
01:08:59,397 --> 01:09:01,798
Before one of them hit him
with a damn rock.

901
01:09:07,137 --> 01:09:09,404
You. Come with me.

902
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,874

He wants to know what
Jacob told you. (pours liquid)

905
01:09:27,786 --> 01:09:30,153
He told me to come here,

906
01:09:30,187 --> 01:09:32,922
Said you guys would
save Sayid. (sets cup down)

907
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:38,227
(translates)
he was beyond saving.

908
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:40,028
Wait a sec.

909
01:09:40,063 --> 01:09:43,031
You're not translating
anhing I say to him,

910
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:44,966
Which means you totally
understand me, dude.

911
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,237
I don't like the way
english tastes on my tongue.

(speaks japanese)

913
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:54,773
When's Jacob getting here?
What do you mean?

914
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:56,841
Is he coming to the temple?

915
01:09:56,876 --> 01:10:00,311
I really don't think
that's gonna happen, man.

916
01:10:00,345 --> 01:10:01,679
Why not?

917
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:04,181
You know... 'cause he's dead.

918

919
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:09,787
What?

920
01:10:09,821 --> 01:10:12,356
You guys didn't know?

921
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:15,527

Send the warning!

928
01:10:44,222 --> 01:10:45,589
Light it!

929
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:51,160

930
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:03,335

getting out of here, huh?

<i>This isn't to keep you in.
It's to keep him out.</i>

01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,675
(fire crackling)

934
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,408
What are you?

935
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:26,843
I'm not a "what," ben.
I'm a "who."

936
01:11:26,878 --> 01:11:28,911
You're the monster.

937
01:11:28,946 --> 01:11:32,647
Let's not resort
to name-calling.

938
01:11:32,682 --> 01:11:34,717

(grunts)

940
01:11:39,355 --> 01:11:41,122
You used me.

941
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:45,526
You couldn't kill him
yourself,

942
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,794
So you made me do it.

943
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:50,963
I didn't make you do
anything.

944
01:11:53,366 --> 01:11:57,068
You should know...

945
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,503
He was very confused
when you killed him.

946
01:11:59,538 --> 01:12:02,272
I seriously doubt
that jacob was ever confused.

947
01:12:02,306 --> 01:12:05,007
I'm not talking about jacob.

948
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:09,344
I'm talking about john locke.

949
01:12:11,147 --> 01:12:14,715
Do you wanna know what
he was thinking while you...

950
01:12:14,749 --> 01:12:17,550
Choked t life out of him,
Benjamin?

951
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:20,618
What the last thought
that ran through his head was?

952
01:12:20,653 --> 01:12:24,591
"I don't understand."

953
01:12:27,595 --> 01:12:30,463
Isn't that just the saddest
thing you ever heard?

954
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:35,501
But it's fitting in a way.

955
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:38,304
Because when john first came
to the island,

956
01:12:38,339 --> 01:12:40,807
He was a very sad man.

957
01:12:40,841 --> 01:12:42,542
A victim

958
01:12:42,576 --> 01:12:45,611
Shouting at the world for being
told what he couldn't do--

959
01:12:45,646 --> 01:12:47,647
Even though they were right.

960
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:50,348
He was weak

961
01:12:50,383 --> 01:12:55,920
And pathetic
and irreparably broken.

962
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:58,756
But despite all that,

963
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:01,325
There was something admirable
about him.

964
01:13:01,359 --> 01:13:05,596
He was the only one of them
who didn't want to leave.

965
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:07,697
The only one who realized

966
01:13:07,732 --> 01:13:11,201
How pitiful
the life he'd left behind

967
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:13,370
Actually was.

968
01:13:18,409 --> 01:13:19,876
Hmm.

969
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:23,913
What do you want?

970
01:13:23,947 --> 01:13:27,250
Well, that's
the great irony here, ben,

971
01:13:27,284 --> 01:13:29,085
Because...

972
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:32,188
I want the one thing
that John Locke didn't.

973
01:13:33,858 --> 01:13:38,094
I want to go home.

974
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:49,647
(water gurgling)

975
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:51,415
(whispers) good-bye, dude.

976
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:55,184
If you ever wanna talk,

977
01:13:55,218 --> 01:13:58,620
I'm around.

978
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:08,290
What?

979
01:14:10,093 --> 01:14:11,726
Nothing.

980
01:14:18,231 --> 01:14:21,332
(grunts)

981
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:25,935
(sighs)

982
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:27,937
Hey.

983
01:14:29,974 --> 01:14:31,141
Where are we?

984
01:14:32,975 --> 01:14:35,076
We're in a temple.

985
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,945
We got caught
by the others again.

986
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:38,979
Yeah.

987
01:14:39,014 --> 01:14:42,549
Only this time,
they're protecting us.

988
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:45,484
I think.
(groans)

989
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:47,619
(inhales sharply)
of course they are.

990
01:14:47,653 --> 01:14:49,821
You all right?

991
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,455
(sighs)

992
01:14:55,693 --> 01:14:58,160
I'm so sorry.

993
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:15,477
You know what you said
back at the hatch?

994
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,845
He's just trying to help us.

995
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,682
I ain't gonna kill Jack.

996
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:26,621
He deserves
to suffer on this rock

997
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,159
Just like the rest of us.

998
01:15:32,997 --> 01:15:35,031
Yeah.

999
01:15:35,065 --> 01:15:39,601
<i>I know, and--you think
I knew this was gonna happen?</i>

1000
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,971
I scheduled it so soon because
want to get it over with.

1001
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,873
<i>(woman over p.A.)
attention all passengers...</i>

1002
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,408
I don't know, mom.

1003
01:15:46,442 --> 01:15:49,410
He's not here, so I can't
tell you what to tell them,

1004
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:52,880
Other than we can't
have the service without him.

1005
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:54,014
Yeah.

1006
01:15:54,048 --> 01:15:57,417
I will call you
if I hear anything.

1007
01:15:57,452 --> 01:15:59,887
(sighs deeply)
(flips cell phone shut)

1008
01:15:59,921 --> 01:16:02,857
<i>What did you lose?</i>

1009
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,327
Oh, they lost one of my bags.
What about you?

1010
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:11,264
(sighs) you wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

1011
01:16:11,298 --> 01:16:12,865
(chuckles) try me.

1012
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:17,469
They lost my father.

1013
01:16:17,503 --> 01:16:19,637
I'm sorry?

1014
01:16:19,672 --> 01:16:22,141
He died in australia
a couple days ago,

1015
01:16:22,175 --> 01:16:24,845
And, um, I flew down
to get him.

1016
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,254
My condolences.

1017
01:16:31,288 --> 01:16:32,522
Yo.

1018
01:16:32,556 --> 01:16:34,691
The coffin was supposed
to go on thelane in Sydney,

1019
01:16:34,726 --> 01:16:36,126
But it didn't.

1020
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:37,795
Apparently,
he's somewhere in transit,

1021
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:38,831
Which is their way of saying

1022
01:16:38,865 --> 01:16:43,267
They have no idea where the hell he is.
Well, how could they know?

1023
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:46,302
Well, they're the ones
that checked him in.

1024
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:49,338
I mean, they've gotta have
some kind of tracking system.

1025
01:16:49,372 --> 01:16:51,974
No, I'm not talking about
the coffin.

1026
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:54,376
I mean, how could they know
where he is?

1027
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:58,846
They didn't lose your father.
They just lost his body.

1028
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,063
Either way, your story
beats the hell out of mine.

1029
01:17:13,097 --> 01:17:15,264
All that was in my suitcase
was a bunch of knives.

1030
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:16,399
Thanks.

1031
01:17:16,433 --> 01:17:18,367
You some kind of salesman?

1032
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,502
Yeah, somethin' like that.

1033
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,539
Well, it's nice talking to you.
I-I hope you find that coffin.

1034
01:17:26,573 --> 01:17:29,574
(chuckles)
I hope you find your knives.

1035
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:30,842
Yeah, thanks.

1036
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:33,244
Mind if I ask
what happened to you?

1037
01:17:34,913 --> 01:17:37,982
I'm sorry. I'mnly asking
because I'm a spinal surgeon.

1038
01:17:38,016 --> 01:17:40,050
I-I didn't mean to...

1039
01:17:40,084 --> 01:17:42,085
Oh, no, don't worry
about it. Uh...

1040
01:17:42,119 --> 01:17:44,387
Uh, surgery isn't gonna
do anythg to help me.

1041
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:47,155
Uh, my conditi
is irreversible.

1042
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:49,958
Nothing's irreversible.

1043
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:58,165
Um...

1044
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:03,204
If you ever want a consult...
Just, uh, give me a call.

1045
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:07,273
It's on the house.

1046
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,809
Well, thanks.

1047
01:18:10,844 --> 01:18:12,477
Jack shephard.

1048
01:18:12,512 --> 01:18:15,580
I'm john. John locke.

1049
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:19,650
It's nice to meet you, john.
Nice to meet you, too.

1050
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,987
Thanks.
You're welcome.

1051
01:18:27,391 --> 01:18:29,525
(flare whooshes)

1052
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:35,230
(frank) what the hell is that?

1053
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:39,100
(murmuring)

1054
01:18:57,416 --> 01:18:59,983
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

1055
01:19:02,253 --> 01:19:04,119
I'm seein' it,

1056
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:06,521
But I'm still not
believin' it.

1057
01:19:09,959 --> 01:19:12,393
Hello, Richard.

1058
01:19:13,428 --> 01:19:16,362
It's good to see you
out of those chains.

1059
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,601
You?

1060
01:19:22,635 --> 01:19:23,635
Me.

1061
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:25,970
(gags and grunts)

1062
01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:27,605
(grunts)

1063
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:41,516
I am very disappointed...
In all of you.

1064
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:25,819
You're Shephard?

1065
01:20:26,853 --> 01:20:29,054
We need to speak
to you privately.

1066
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:34,292
If you've got something
to say to me, then say it.

1067
01:20:34,326 --> 01:20:36,827
Otherwise,
just leave me alone.

1068
01:20:36,861 --> 01:20:38,895
I don't think you're
understanding me here.

1069
01:20:38,929 --> 01:20:40,396
I'm asking politely.

1070
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:43,632
You either get up
and come with us on your own,

1071
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:45,601
Or I'll have you dragged out.

1072
01:20:45,635 --> 01:20:47,603
Because we are going
to have this conversation,

1073
01:20:47,637 --> 01:20:51,305
And it's not going
to be here. - Is that right?

1074
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:00,747
Jack!

1075
01:21:02,349 --> 01:21:05,751
Oh, my god.

1076
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,656
(whispers) what...

1077
01:21:15,026 --> 01:21:16,894
What happened?

1078
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:20,000
