1
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,861
Mr. Locke.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,965
- Hmm.
- Mr. Locke.

3
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,592
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

4
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,209
Welcome back.

5
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,375
I know you.

6
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:22,726
(chuckles)

7
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:24,726
We were on the same flight back
from Sydney.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,999
I met you in the
baggage claim office.

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,320
You had lost your knives.

10
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,669
I'm Jack Shephard.

11
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,937
What happened?

12
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:39,993
You were run down by a car.
You just came out of surgery.

13
00:00:41,844 --> 00:00:43,727
Am I... (inhales sharply)

14
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:46,453
Am I all right?

15
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:48,112
Your dural sac ruptured.

16
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:51,416
But I think I got everything
back were it belongs.

17
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,790
Mr. Locke, while I was
operating, I got a look

18
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,826
At the initial injury to your spine--
The one that put you in the wheelchair.

19
00:00:59,946 --> 00:01:02,903
And I was hoping you could
tell me how that happened.

20
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:05,216
Why?

21
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,864
Because I think
you're a candidate.

22
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:13,055
A candidate for what?

23
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:14,803
A new procedure,

24
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:17,607
A surgery we're
developing, and...

25
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:20,330
If it works, it could restore
feeling to your legs.

26
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:23,303
In fact, you may
even walk again.

27
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,048
If you'll give me a shot,
Mr. Locke,

28
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:28,522
I think that...
That I could fix you.

29
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,207
No, thank you.

30
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,606
Well, now there's minimal risk,
and--and the benefit could--

31
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,236
I said no, doctor.

32
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:43,679
(door opens)

33
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,872
(voice breaks) John?

34
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,770
- Oh.
- Oh, John.

35
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:50,359
It's the first time they let
me see you. Oh! (chuckles)

36
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,055
- Are--are you okay?
- I'm fine. Hi.

37
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:58,595
- Are you his doctor?
- Yes, I am. Dr. Shephard.

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,008
Oh, thank you. (chuckles)

39
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:03,750
Thank you.
Thank you for saving him.

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,048
(chuckles)
Thank you.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,768
(surf rolling)

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,986
(groans)

43
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,417
Welcome to Hydra Island.

44
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,679
At least you didn't
have to paddle.

45
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:52,752
Get in.

46
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:53,725
Unh-unh.

47
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,049
Ain't no way I'm gettin'
back in those cages.

48
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,120
- Well, I've got the gun, so you--
- Not anymore, doughboy.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,064
(gunshot) drop the gun!

50
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,838
Put the gun down
or I'll kill her!

51
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:06,983
You ain't gonna kill anybody.

52
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,794
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be throwing us in a cage.

53
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:11,933
I have a list of names.
Ford, you're on it,

54
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,124
As are Reyes and the Kwons.

55
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,283
Kate Austen? She's not.

56
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,910
It doesn't matter to me
whether she lives or dies.

57
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,576
Don't listen to him.

58
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,536
(grunts)

59
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:40,864
(cage door clanks)

60
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:42,624
You may not believe it,

61
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,693
But I'm doing this
for your own good.

62
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,971
<i>You're right.
I don't believe it.</i>

63
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:52,262
Is the fence live yet?
They're saying about an hour.

64
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:55,262
We haven't got an hour.
Tell them to work faster.

65
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,208
He's coming.

67
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,774
(whirring)

68
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,083
Hello?

69
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,875
Excuse me?

70
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,088
- Hello?
- Hmm?

71
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,519
Oh! (whirring stops)

72
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,715
I'm sorry. There was
no one out front,

73
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,246
And I heard the drill.

74
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:40,260
- Do you know where I can find Dr. Nadler?
- Well, you can find him right here.

75
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,711
And if you're not a patient,
you can call me Bernard.

76
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,598
(chuckles) Hi.

77
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,004
Jack Shephard.

78
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:52,103
Um, I'm a surgeon over at st.
Sebastian,

79
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:55,520
And I was hoping to get a look
at one of your patient files.

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,923
And which patient would that be?

81
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,673
His name's John Locke,
and our records said

82
00:04:59,793 --> 00:05:04,126
That you had done some emergency oral
surgery on him about three years back.

83
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,523
- And what are you looking for, exactly?
- I wanna know how he was hurt.

84
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:11,986
Do you mind if I ask you why you're
so interested in Mr. Locke, Jack?

85
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:14,836
Um...

86
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,532
He and I met about a week ago.

87
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,557
We were on the same flight back
from Australia.

88
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:22,703
Oceanic 815.

89
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:27,994
I sat across the aisle from you.

90
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:30,852
If memory serves,

91
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,757
You were flirting with my wife rose
when I was in the bathroom.

92
00:05:35,456 --> 00:05:37,304
It's pretty weird, huh?

93
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:38,893
Yeah.

94
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:45,324
Well... Maybe you're on
to something here, hmm?

95
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,232
Now I can't break
patient confidentiality

96
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:51,722
And tell you something
I shouldn't,

97
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:54,631
<i>But I can tell you that when
I treated Mr. Locke,</i>

98
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,969
There was another man in
the same accident with him.

99
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,206
Wait, that was...Three years ago.
You just...

100
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,748
Remember that?

101
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,989
Of course I do, Jack.

102
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,636
Anthony Cooper.

103
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,645
Good luck, doc.

104
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:15,239
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

105
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:24,331
What happened?

106
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,397
There was a mortar attack.

107
00:06:28,517 --> 00:06:30,423
Widmore's people fired on us.

108
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,376
Locke saved you.

109
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:41,057
What about the rest of your group?
What happened to them?

110
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,878
The ones who weren't killed
scattered into the jungle.

111
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:46,672
It's just the three of us now.

112
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,917
Why did he bring me here?

113
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:51,322
Because your friends got
themselves captured.

114
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,460
And now...

115
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,849
We're gonna have to rescue them.

116
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,014
Rescue them from what?

117
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:00,837
Widmore has them in a cage
about a half a mile inland.

118
00:07:00,957 --> 00:07:03,122
- Why would he--
- You know, I would ask him,

119
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:06,476
Except I don't think he's gonna
give me a straight answer.

120
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:10,122
But I can't imagine that
his intentions are good.

121
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,228
If we move right now,

122
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,737
We can break your people out,
run for the plane

123
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:18,472
And be off this island before
Widmore knows what hit him.

124
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,836
They're not my people.

125
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,933
And I'm not leaving the island.

126
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,333
Well, Jack, I'm hoping you'll still
change your mind about that.

127
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:32,647
<i>But your friends do
want to leave.</i>

128
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,681
And since they just ran
away from me on my own boat,

129
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:40,666
I'm gonna need your help convincing them
that they can trust me.

130
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,893
<i>Why should I trust you?</i>

131
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:50,599
Because I could kill you,
Jack, right here, right now.

132
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,924
And I could kill every
single one of your friends,

133
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,867
And there's not a thing that
you could do to stop me.

134
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:01,173
But instead of killing you, I saved
your life. And now I wanna save them, too.

135
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,237
So will you help me?

136
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,413
(birds chirping)

137
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,749
You feel like we're
runnin' in circles?

138
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:28,209
Back in these cages...

139
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,211
<i>Except last time,
the gun was to my head.</i>

140
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,100
He wouldn't have
killed me, James.

141
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,508
That cave I told you about,

142
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,568
Where all the names are written?

143
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,501
Your name was there, too,

144
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,713
But it was crossed out.

145
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:54,788
He doesn't need you, Kate.

146
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:04,942
So she's with your mother?

147
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,479
Yes. You saw her pictures? How?

148
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,621
Widmore's people found
your camera on the plane.

149
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,204
He showed me the pictures.

150
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,787
Our daughter--

151
00:09:17,422 --> 00:09:19,237
She's so beautiful.

152
00:09:24,508 --> 00:09:26,421
I have your ring.

153
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:41,828
(laughs)

154
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,501
(kisses)

155
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:47,998
(generator powers down)

156
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,444
Uh-oh.

157
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:53,769
(man) What happened?
(man speaking indistinctly)

158
00:09:56,448 --> 00:09:58,627
(man) Somebody shut us down?
What's going on?

159
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:03,137
Somebody killed the power.
Get a team to that generator now!

160
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,915
(leaves rustling)

161
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,949

Hey.

168
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,181
I think I can reach
the keys. (grunts)

(groans)

170
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:49,999
Hurry. When that thing's done with them,
he's coming for us.

171
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:51,926
Well, I ain't waitin'.

172
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,228
Uhh! Damn it!

<i>(roars)</i>

177
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,161
I'm with him. Come on.

(Frank panting)

180
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,671
How much further to the plane?

181
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,757
I'd say about a quarter-mile,
just over that ridge.

182
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,776
So you're coming with us now?

183
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:35,938
I'm gonna take you to the plane,
but I'm not getting on it.

184
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:39,168
I'm sorry, Kate. I'm...

185
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,886
I'm not meant to go.

186
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,584
Thanks for coming back for us, doc.
Appreciate it.

187
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,207
(footsteps approaching)

188
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,200
No, it's okay.

189
00:11:56,512 --> 00:11:59,115
Sayid's with us. He was the one
who turned off the generators.

190
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,608
Great. The more the merrier.

191
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,351
We need to go. Locke's waiting.

192
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,171
Are you a relative of Mr.
Cooper's?

193
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,145
Uh, no. No, I'm not, but--

194
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,555
M-may I ask the
nature of the visit?

195
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,602
Um... Dr. Shephard?

196
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:21,834
Hey. (chuckles)

197
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:23,344
What are you doing here?

198
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:26,602
Um, I'm here to see
Anthony Cooper.

199
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,548
Do you know him?
Is that why you're here, too?

200
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:31,131
What do you want with Anthony?

201
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,318
I wanna talk to him about the accident
that he was in with Mr. Locke.

202
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,231
Um, Dr. Shephard...

203
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,894
Just go.

204
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:42,388
Look, all I wanna
do is help him.

205
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:45,686
I know. John told me
about the operation.

206
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,043
He doesn't want it.

207
00:12:47,163 --> 00:12:48,434
Why doesn't he want it?

208
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:51,295
Please, Dr. Shephard,
just leave this alone.

209
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,156
You saved John's life.

210
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,111
Why can't that be enough?

211
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,665
Because it's not.

This is Anthony Cooper.

He's John's father.

(Frank) Well, all righty.

223
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,578
Let's see what it'll take
to get this baby to fly.

224
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,388
Son of a bitch.

225
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,341
His neck's been broken.

226
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,941
That's because I broke it.

227
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:58,766
If it's any consolation,

228
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,574
Widmore knew that I
would kill these men.

229
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,638
What are you talking about?

230
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,525
They were only guarding
the plane for show.

231
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,773
If Charles had really wanted to keep me
from actually getting onboard,

232
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,467
He wouldn't have moved
his little fences.

233
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:12,020
<i>Well, wait. Now he wants us
to leave the island?</i>

234
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,477
No, Hugo. He wants to get
us all in the same place at the same time--

235
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:18,391
A nice, confined space we have
no hope of getting out of.

236
00:16:19,524 --> 00:16:21,173
And then he wants to kill us.

237
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,366
- Kill us with what?
- With this.

238
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,741
4 bricks of c4.

239
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,062
I found 'em in one of the
overhead compartments,

240
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,087
Wired to the electrical
system of the plane.

241
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:38,654
If we would've turned it on...

242
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:41,817
Boom.

243
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,329
So what now?

244
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:48,469
We can't be sure he didn't put more
explosives on the plane. It's not safe.

245
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:51,081
If we're gonna leave the island,

246
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:53,830
I think we have to
take the submarine.

247
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,190
Well, that's what I've been
sayin' all along.

248
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,680
Dude, wait.

249
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:01,064
He's not supposed
to leave the island.

250
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:04,718
- I mean, Alpert said--
- Screw Alpert. He ain't here.

251
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,645
That's twice you've
saved our asses.

252
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,287
Guess I was wrong about you.

253
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:12,797
Thank you, James.

254
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:16,698
(Locke) that submarine is
gonna be heavily defended.

255
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,909
We're gonna need everyone.

256
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:24,199
I'll help you, but like I said,
I'm not going with you.

257
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,941
Fair enough.

258
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:29,054
Let's go.

259
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,126
Hey.

260
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:40,007
- I-I'm sorry that I...
- That's all right, Claire.

261
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:42,663
I understand why
you went with them.

262
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:47,582
(lowered voice) Hey, doc, listen up.

263
00:17:48,022 --> 00:17:50,649
You don't wanna leave this island,
that's your own damn business.

264
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,653
But I'm gonna ask you
for one last favor.

265
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:55,255
I don't trust that
thing one bit,

266
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,825
So here's what I need you to do.

267
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,443
Once we get to the dock,

268
00:17:58,563 --> 00:18:00,598
You make sure it
doesn't get on the sub.

269
00:18:01,587 --> 00:18:03,931
How am I supposed to do that?
You saw what it did back there.

270
00:18:04,911 --> 00:18:07,156
Just get it in the water.
I'll take care of the rest.

271
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,152
Mm.

274
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,177
Push the button.

275
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,839
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

I wish you had believed me.

277

Ms. Littleton? Wh--

279
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:42,973
Dr. Shephard. I-I was
just looking for you.

280
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:45,377

told me you work here.

283
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:50,458
Yes. Yes.

00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,602
Sorry I had to run out

289
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:03,052

290
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,694

- Oh. N-no worries.

you as it is for me. (chuckles)

293
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:14,825
I never even met this man.

294
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:18,208
Anyway, the, uh,
the lawyer gave me this.

295
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:20,904
She said, uh, there'd
be more stuff to come,

296
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,770
But that my father especially
wanted me to have this.

297
00:19:25,147 --> 00:19:28,346
You know why or
what it's supposed to mean?

298
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,754
I have no idea.

299
00:19:30,874 --> 00:19:32,304
But then...

300
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,741
I-I didn't know about you,
either.

301
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,692
Our father, uh...

302
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:42,791
You mind--you mind
if I ask how he died?

303
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:48,168
He was found in an alley
outside a bar in Sydney.

304
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:51,032
He drank himself to death.

305
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:53,951
I flew down to bring
his body back,

306
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:58,032
But then, uh... (sighs)
the airline lost it.

307
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,694
I just flew in from
Sydney few days ago.

308
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,437
When?

309
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,046
Uh, last Wednesday.

310
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:07,284

Uh... Yeah.

have a look at that?

313

00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:56,505
Why don't you come stay with me?

322
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,445
Stay with you?

323
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,956
I mean, we're...
We're strangers.

324
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,578
(laughs) No, we're not
strangers. We're...

325
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:07,760
We're family.

326
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,174
Just 'cause there ain't
any goons on the dock

327
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:34,942
Doesn't mean they
ain't on the sub.

328
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,790
We're going in hard. Got it?

329
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,153
Lapidus, Hugo, Jin,
Sun-- you're with me.

330
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:41,915
The rest of you wait 30 seconds,
head down the dock behind us.

331
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:45,729
You think you two
can get our backs?

332
00:21:49,452 --> 00:21:50,902
Absolutely.

333
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:55,611
All right. (sighs)

334
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,409
Let's go home.

335
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:03,720
(gun clicking)

336
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:25,910
(hatch clicks open, thuds)

337
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:27,689
(creaks)

338
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:37,291
<i>(man over p.A.) After engine room,</i>
<i>power the bilges.</i>

339
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,945
<i>After engine room,
power the bilges, please.</i>

340
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,251
Where's the damn Captain?

341
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:57,180
<i>(speaking indistinctly)</i>

342
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,339
Put your damn hands up.

343
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:03,240
(grunts) Nothin' personal.

344
00:23:03,856 --> 00:23:06,522
Okay, Hoss, how about you get
ready to fire this thing up?

345
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,179
I got it.

346
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,240
Let's go.

347
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,327
You sure you won't
reconsider, Jack?

348
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,035
Yeah, I'm sure.

349
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,622
Whoever told you
you needed to stay

350
00:23:38,742 --> 00:23:40,993
Had no idea what they
were talking about.

351
00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:44,594
John Locke told me
I needed to stay.

352
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,330
What happened? (gunshot)

353
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,569
Kate?! (gunfire)

354
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:05,736
(groans) Aah!

355
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:07,866
(grunts)

356
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,471
Claire! <i>Let's go now!</i>

357
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:13,458
(gunfire continues) (groans)

358
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,283
(Kate groaning) What's
going on up there?

359
00:24:43,403 --> 00:24:44,723
What happened?

360
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:46,361
Widmore's people shot her.

361
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,729
(groans)

362
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:53,162
(gasping) Hurley,
I need a first aid Kit.

363
00:24:53,282 --> 00:24:55,466
- Who else is up there?
- Claire.

364
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,941
(gunfire continues)

365
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:03,274
Claire!

366
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:04,842
<i>James!</i>

367
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,458
(gunshot)

368
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,313
Lapidus, if you can hear me,

369
00:25:19,433 --> 00:25:21,360
- Dive! Dive!
- Let's go!

370
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:26,411
(levers click, engines power up)

371
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,372
- Hey! Wait, wait!
- Claire, wait!

372
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,631
<i>- Wait!</i>
- Claire!

373
00:25:34,969 --> 00:25:36,260
What the hell are you doing?

374
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,931
What we came here to do-
leaving.

375
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,842
- It's all right. It's all right.
- No!

376
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:43,993
They're leaving us!

377
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:47,371
No, trust me. You don't
want to be on that sub.

378
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,276
- Claire?
- Kate.

379
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,516
- Claire? Where's Claire?
- She's still up there.

380
00:26:08,636 --> 00:26:10,722
- No, we can't leave without her. We can't--
- Kate. Kate.

381
00:26:10,842 --> 00:26:13,476
- Is she gonna be okay? - Jack,
I can't find the first aid Kit, dude.

382
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,551
Jin--my pack.

383
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,577
There might be a shirt in
there I can use for pressure.

384
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:22,260
It's okay. Just relax.
Everything's gonna be all right.

385
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,138
Here. Can you help her?

386
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:26,741
I think the bullet went
straight through...

387
00:26:27,675 --> 00:26:29,264
What?

388
00:26:29,384 --> 00:26:31,311
(Kate groans)

389
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:48,210
Dude, where'd that come from?

390
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:50,185
Locke.

391
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,500
We did exactly what he wanted.

392
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:04,680
- We have to get to the surface.
- What the hell?

393
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,639
<i>We have to get to the
surface now!</i>

394
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,591
Lapidus, take us up.

395
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,861
- We're divin'!
- Just do it!

396
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,624
You heard him. Up!

397
00:27:18,776 --> 00:27:20,398
(levers click)

398
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,040
- Dude, how'd that get on the sub?
- Locke put it in my pack.

399
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,027
Why would he do that?
He wanted to come with us.

400
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:28,944
You're damn right he did.
That's why I shut his ass out.

401
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,473
<i>He wanted you to shut him out.
Any idea how that thing works?</i>

402
00:27:32,593 --> 00:27:35,314
- Can we turn it off?
- This watch is jury-rigged to the battery.

403
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:39,422
- The battery detonates the explosives.
- How much time till we're up, Frank?

404
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:42,007
At least five minutes.

405
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:44,926
We ain't got five minutes.
What's it gonna be, Sayid?

406
00:27:45,046 --> 00:27:46,598
These wires--they're
leads from the watch.

407
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,126
If we disconnect them
from the battery,

408
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:50,983
- Technically speaking, the bomb
should be inert. - "Technically"?

409
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,762
Yes, but you need to pull
them out simultaneously,

410
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:54,655
- And I'm not sure--
- Step aside.

411
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,390
- No, wait. Wait.
- What the hell are you doing, doc?

412
00:27:58,293 --> 00:27:59,882
Nothing's gonna happen.

413
00:28:00,518 --> 00:28:02,325
What? Don't pull
those wires out.

414
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,127
We're okay.
Nothing's gonna happen.

415
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,020
If I don't pull these wires,
Locke's gonna blow us

416
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:09,705
- To kingdom come.
- No, he's not! Locke can't kill us.

417
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,329
Uh... What?

418
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:14,764
This is what he wanted.
This is what he's been waiting for.

419
00:28:14,785 --> 00:28:17,511
Everything that he has done
has been to get us here.

420
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,189
He wanted to get us
all in the same place

421
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,296
At the same time-
a nice enclosed space

422
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:24,138
- Where we had no hopes of getting out of.
- I don't understand.

423
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:26,622
Locke said that he can't
leave the island without us.

424
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:30,415
I think that he can't leave the island
unless we're all dead.

425
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,817
He told me that he could
kill any one of us

426
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:35,738
Whenever he wanted,
so what if he hasn't because he's...

427
00:28:36,036 --> 00:28:37,716
He's not allowed to?

428
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,814
What if he's trying to get
us to kill each other?

429
00:28:42,609 --> 00:28:44,131
Stay out of my way, doc.

430
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:45,433
Now if he wanted that
thing to blow up,

431
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:47,506
Why would he put a timer in it? Why not
just throw it inside?

432
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,405
- I don't care.
- Nothing is gonna happen.

433
00:28:49,424 --> 00:28:50,492
It's not your decision to make.

434
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,918
- He can't kill us!
- I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!

435
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,078
James...

436
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,862
We are going to be okay.

437
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,799
You just have to trust me.

438
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,036
Sorry, doc, I don't.

439
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:12,008
(clatter) (gasps)

440
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,304
(Jack gasps)

441
00:29:16,424 --> 00:29:18,049
(metal creaks)

442
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,373
Listen carefully.
There's a well on the main island

443
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,439
A half mile South from
the camp we just left.

444
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,224
Desmond's inside it.
Locke wants him dead,

445
00:29:36,562 --> 00:29:38,608
Which means you're going to need him.
Do you understand me?

446
00:29:38,728 --> 00:29:40,198
Why are you telling me this?

447
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,821
Because it's going
to be you, Jack.

448
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:46,012
Sayid!

449
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:53,003
(loud explosion)

450
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:55,404
(metal creaking)

451
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,920
(Frank grunts)

452
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:03,116
(alarm sounding)

453
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:08,643
(panting)

454
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:10,435
(metal creaking)

455
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,503
Oh, hell.

456
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:21,243
Uhh!

457
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,115
(alarm continues sounding)

458
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:29,099
(Jack grunts)

459
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,795
- Are you okay?
- What happened? Did Sayid just...

460
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,315
Help!

461
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:46,644
- Sun!
- Help!

462
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,236
Wait! (crying)

463
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,454
Hold on. I'll get you out. Jin!

464
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:55,282
No!

465
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,024
- Sawyer! I need help!
- Jin!

466
00:30:59,116 --> 00:31:00,478
Hurley!

467
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:02,613
(Jack) Hurley!

468
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,183
You gotta take Kate outta here.

469
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:07,149
- What about everybody else?
- I'll take care of them!

470
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:11,001
I have to go after Sayid!

471
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,690
There is no Sayid!

472
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:16,375
Listen to me. Take this tank

473
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:19,235
And buddy-breathe and swim out
where the blast hole, okay?

474
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:22,359
Hurley, you can do this, okay?

475
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,823
Okay.

476
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:25,995
Go.

477
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:27,813
(grunting)

478
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,917
(gasping and crying)

479
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,405
Doc!

480
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:51,484
(wailing) push. On three.

481
00:31:51,604 --> 00:31:54,067
One... Two... Three.

482
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:55,378
(Sawyer grunts)

483
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,926
(creaking)

484
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:02,010
(gasping)

485
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,517
(metal creaking)

486
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:04,919
(loud clanking)

487
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:07,078
Sawyer!

488
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,805
(Jin) Jack!

489
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,612
Sawyer!

490
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,454
Sawyer!

491
00:32:14,837 --> 00:32:16,981
(grunts) Sawyer.

492
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:23,968
Jin...

493
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:25,222
Go.

494
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,288
- No.
- Save yourself.

495
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:28,675
I'm going to get
you out of here.

496
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,836
Go. Go. I'll get her free.

497
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,545
No. We can do this!

498
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,373
Just go! Save Sawyer.

499
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:44,710
(Sun cries)

500
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,836
Jin!

501
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,776
Take this. I can get
him out without it.

502
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:53,718
No, you can't, Jack.

503
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,502
Just go.

504
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:02,993
Go.

505
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,246
(grunting)

506
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,411
Jin.

507
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:06,948
You have to go.

508
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:09,176
No, I can do this.

509
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,302
No. No, you can't.

510
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,064
(crying) Please go.

511
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,428
I won't leave you.

512
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:19,944
(grunts)

513
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:36,485
I'm gonna get you out of here.

514
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:38,338
Go.

515
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,651
Go. Please.

516
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,102
Go!

517
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:04,705
I love you, Sun.

518
00:35:06,275 --> 00:35:08,401
I love you. (crying)

519
00:36:09,786 --> 00:36:11,978
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.A.)</i>

520
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,638
Is somebody meeting you,
Mr. Locke?

521
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,123
Yes, my fiance, Helen.

522
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:18,963
She's, uh...

523
00:36:20,547 --> 00:36:22,236
Probably stuck in traffic.

524
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:24,282
Hey, I'll take it from here.

525
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,653
You know,
I'm pretty good at this.

526
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:29,011
- Well, best of luck to you, sir.
- Thank you. See ya.

527
00:36:29,457 --> 00:36:30,788
Mr. Locke.

528
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,411
I'm glad I caught ya.

529
00:36:33,897 --> 00:36:35,725
I hadn't have a chance
to say good-bye yet.

530
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,215
Well, good-bye.

531
00:36:37,335 --> 00:36:38,459
(chuckles)

532
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:40,419
And thanks again, Dr. Shephard.

533
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,851
I went to see your father.

534
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,546
W-what?

535
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,759
When you didn't
want the surgery,

536
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,629
I felt like I had to understand why,
and, uh, you know,

537
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,723
I thought that if I could find
out why you're in this chair,

538
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,179
That maybe-
I was in a plane crash.

539
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:10,891
I had had my--my private
pilot's license for a week,

540
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:16,893
And, uh, I begged my father to
be my first official passenger.

541
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,545
He was terrified of flying.

542
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,624
But I looked him right in the eye
and I told him he could

543
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:24,281
trust me.

544
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:27,977
And we barely got
off the ground.

545
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:30,075
I-I still don't re--

546
00:37:31,827 --> 00:37:34,747
I don't remember
what I did wrong,

547
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:36,903
<i>But it was my fault.
It was my fault</i>

548
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,750
That this man who I
loved more than anything

549
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,802
Will never walk or... Talk or...

550
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:53,028
You know, the first
time you and I met, um,

551
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:55,392
Back at the-- at the airport...

552
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:58,813
You told me that
my father was gone,

553
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:00,899
And, uh,

554
00:38:01,336 --> 00:38:03,525
It hurt to hear that,
but I knew you were right.

555
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,241
Your father's gone,
too, Mr. Locke.

556
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:10,608
- Uh, no, no, he's not.
- Yes, he--he is,

557
00:38:10,728 --> 00:38:12,269
And you can punish yourself
as much as you want,

558
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,115
And that's never
gonna bring him back.

559
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,132
What happened, happened,

560
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:20,003
And...

561
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,835
You can let it go.

562
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,413
What makes you think
letting go is so easy?

563
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:28,710
It's not.

564
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:32,528
In fact, I don't really
know how to do it myself.

565
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:38,421
And that's why I
was hoping that...

566
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,395
Maybe you could go first.

567
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,699
(laughs)

568
00:38:50,826 --> 00:38:52,449
Good-bye, Dr. Shephard.

569
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,215
<i>I can help you, John.</i>

570
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,786
I wish you believed me.

571
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:40,755
(coughs)

572
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,387
Jack.

573
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:44,818
(panting)

574
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:46,189
(grunts)

575
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,253
I couldn't find you.

576
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,120
I couldn't find you.

577
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:53,413
(coughs)

578
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:56,323
- Is he okay?
- He got hit in the head pretty hard,

579
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:57,677
But he's breathing.

580
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,227
What about Jin and Sun?

581
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:21,121
(crying)

582
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:35,651
(sighs deeply)

583
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:50,746
(cries)

584
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,900
(water lapping)

585
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,811
It sunk.

586
00:40:57,725 --> 00:40:59,950
What, t-the submarine?

587
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,651
But... They-
-they were all on it.

588
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:05,051
Everyone.

589
00:41:05,538 --> 00:41:09,526
- What they're-- they're all dead?
- Not all of them.

590
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,358
Wait. W-where you going?

591
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,127
To finish what I started.

592
