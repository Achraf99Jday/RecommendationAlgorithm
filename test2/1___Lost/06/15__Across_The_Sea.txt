1
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,935
Aah! Aah!

2
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,640
That's a lovely name.

3
00:02:17,175 --> 00:02:18,621
Where are the rest
of your people?

4
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,920
There's only me.

5
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:23,516
How did you get here?

6
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:25,875
The same way you got here--

7
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:28,539
By accident.

8
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:36,353
How long have you-
every question I answer

9
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,109
Will simply lead to
another question.

10
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:41,716
You should rest.
Just be grateful you're alive.

11
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:48,086
There were other people on my ship.
I need to go-- no.

12
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:51,877
If there are other people on
the island, I will find them.

13
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:58,943
The baby?

14
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:03,969
Oh!

15
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,445
Oh!

16
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:09,967
It's coming.

17
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,033
That's it.

18
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:22,075
Push! Push harder.

19
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,917
I can't!

20
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:24,483
Yes, you can.

21
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,647
That's good!

22
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:29,152
One more push.

23
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,501
Oh! Oh!

24
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,897
It's a boy.

25
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,237
His name is Jacob.

26
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:55,909
It's a boy.

27
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,843
Can ..

28
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,566
There's another baby.

29
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,526
Aah!

30
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:18,966
Push again.

31
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:21,773
Here it comes.

32
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,086
Now!

33
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,009
Oh!

34
00:04:32,807 --> 00:04:33,778
It's another boy.

35
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,499
I only picked one name.

36
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:58,298
Oh. Shh. Shh.

37
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,586
May I see him?

38
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,219
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:15,643
Uhh!

40
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,726
H!

41
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,519
Uhh! Uhh

42
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:31,942

43
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,312
What is it?

44
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,232
It's a game.

45
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:19,344
You play it.

46
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,103
How do you know how?

47
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:30,736
I just know.

48
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,903
Will you show me how to play?

49
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:38,288
If you promise not
to tell mother.

50
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,415
Why can't we tell her?

51
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,951
Because she'll take it away.

52
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:46,415
So... Do you wanna play
or don't you, Jacob?

53
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:54,848
Yes. I wanna play.

54
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:08,239
Hello, mother.

55
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:10,656
Where's your brother?

56
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,048
He's down at the beach...

57
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,248
Staring out at the ocean.

58
00:07:24,592 --> 00:07:25,792
Can I help you?

59
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,696
If you like, you can sort that.

60
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,175
What were you and your brother
doing down at the beach?

61
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,975
We were just... Walking.

62
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:45,562
Do you love me, Jacob?

63
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,240
Yes.

64
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,210
Then tell me what happened.

65
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,384
May I join you?

66
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,144
Sure.

67
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,008
Jacob told you what I found.

68
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,296
Of course he did.

69
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:27,303
Jacob doesn't know how to lie.

70
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:29,224
He's not like you.

71
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,983
Why? What am I like?

72
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,176
You're...

73
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,968
Special.

74
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:46,056
Can I keep the game?

75
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,191
Of course you can.

76
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:49,888
That's why I left it for you.

77
00:08:50,873 --> 00:08:52,071
It came from you?

78
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:55,464
Of course it did.
Where else would it come from?

79
00:08:58,176 --> 00:08:59,319
From somewhere else.

80
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,032
Across the sea.

81
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:06,720
There is nowhere else.

82
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,663
The island is all there is.

83
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,416
Then where did we come from?

84
00:09:14,158 --> 00:09:15,768
You and your
brother came from me,

85
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,178
And I came from my mother.

86
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:18,735
Where is she?

87
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:21,851
She's dead.

88
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,360
What's "dead"?

89
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:29,384
Something you will never
have to worry about.

90
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,418
Hurry up! He's getting away!

91
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:57,843
Hide!

92
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,878
Who are they? Shh!

93
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,472
Mother!

94
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:38,389
Mother!

95
00:10:40,911 --> 00:10:41,974
What's wrong?

96
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:45,418
<i>We saw people. Men.</i>

97
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,904
How many were there? Three.
They killed a boar.

98
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,245
Did they see you?

99
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,214
No.

100
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,601
I don't think so.

101
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,711
Where did they come from?
They looked like us.

102
00:10:56,877 --> 00:10:58,029
<i>They're not like us.</i>

103
00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,149
They don't belong here.

104
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,309
<i>We are here for a reason.</i>

105
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,345
What reason?

106
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,134
It's not time yet.

107
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:13,774
<i>Mother, what reason?</i>

108
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,321
Come with me.

109
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,750
Did you know about
the people? Yes.

110
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,644
Why didn't you
tell us about them?

111
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:35,190
Because they're dangerous, and I didn't want
to frighten you. What makes them dangerous?

112
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:38,238
The same thing that
makes all men dangerous.

113
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,425
They come. They fight.
They destroy. They corrupt.

114
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,017
And it always ends the same.

115
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:48,105
They "come"? Come from where?
Another part of the island.

116
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:49,673
<i>And you're never to go
looking for them.</i>

117
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,000
If they found you,
they would hurt you.

118
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:54,504
Why would they hurt us? Because they're
people, Jacob, and that's what people do.

119
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,277
<i>But we're people. Does that mean
that we can hurt each other?</i>

120
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:06,917
I've made it so you can
never hurt each other.

121
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,489
What is this place?

122
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,952
This is the reason we're here.

123
00:12:38,918 --> 00:12:40,186
Don't go in there.

124
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:48,413
What's down there?

125
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,565
Light.

126
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:52,738
The warmest,

127
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:54,814
Brightest light

128
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,657
You've ever seen or felt.

129
00:12:58,454 --> 00:13:02,625
And we must make sure
that no one ever finds it.

130
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:05,778
It's beautiful.

131
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,234
Yes, it is.

132
00:13:09,402 --> 00:13:10,778
And that's why they want it,

133
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,038
Because a little bit
of this very same light

134
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,254
Is inside of every man.

135
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,902
But they always want more.

136
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,082
Can they take it?

137
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,947
No, but they would try.

138
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,166
And if they tried,
they could put it out.

139
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,326
And if the light
goes out here...

140
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,893
It goes out everywhere.

141
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:34,182
And so I've protected
this place,

142
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,734
But I can't protect it forever.

143
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:38,884
Then who will?

144
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,999
It will have to be one of you.

145
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:12,023
You can't do that, Jacob.
Why not?

146
00:14:12,243 --> 00:14:13,871
Because it's against the rules.

147
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:16,014
You made the rules. I found it.

148
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,690
One day, you can make
up your own game,

149
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,631
<i>And everyone else will have
to follow your rules.</i>

150
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:27,170
<i>It's all right.</i>

151
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,411
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

152
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,950
What?

153
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:40,839
What's wrong?

154
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:42,254
I'm going for a
walk to the beach.

155
00:14:43,554 --> 00:14:44,615
I'll meet you late

156
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,126
<i>Hello.</i>

157
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,350
Why can't Jacob see you?

158
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,003
<i>Because I'm dead.</i>

159
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,918
<i>Will you come with me?
I'd like to show you something.</i>

160
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,415
Show me what?

161
00:15:08,778 --> 00:15:10,266
<i>Where you came from.</i>

162
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:14,143
<i>It's across the island-
a place you've never seen.</i>

163
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,895
<i>Who are they?</i>

164
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,887
<i>They came here 13 years ago--</i>

165
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:46,591
<i>The day before you were born.</i>

166
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:49,593
<i>Their ship was wrecked
in a storm.</i>

167
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,331
Ship. What's that?

168
00:15:52,506 --> 00:15:55,447
<i>It's a way for people to get
from one place to another.</i>

169
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:59,127
<i>It's how we came across t sea.</i>

170
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:01,754
But there's nothing
across the sea.

171
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,224
<i>There are many things
across the sea.</i>

172
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:09,257
<i>You come from across the sea,
too.</i>

173
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,462
No. That's not true.

174
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:14,355
That's not what
my mother told me.

175
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,043
<i>She's not your mother.</i>

176
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,211
<i>I am.</i>

177
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:38,886
Jacob.

178
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:41,826
Jacob, wake up.

179
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:45,161
Come with me.

180
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:53,002
Why do you have all your things?

181
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,434
<i>They're our things.</i>

182
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:56,743
I took them because
we're leaving,

183
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,634
And we're never
coming back. What?

184
00:16:59,626 --> 00:17:00,692
Just follow me.

185
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,730
Follow you where?

186
00:17:04,586 --> 00:17:05,747
To the people.

187
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,474
No. We're supposed to
stay away from them.

188
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,993
<i>They're our people, Jacob,
and we're gonna live with them.</i>

189
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,206
No, mother said--

190
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,910
She lied. She lied about
everything--all of it.

191
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,826
I know you don't understand,
but you have to come with me.

192
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,588
I don't want to go by myself.
We can't. Mother loves us.

193
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,670
She doesn't love u stop!

194
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:21,903
It was all a lie! Stop it!

195
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,423
She's not even our mother! Aah!

196
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,787
No! Jacob!

197
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,914
What are you doing?
He's leaving!

198
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,683
He's going to them!

199
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,507
To the other people!

200
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,354
What?

201
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,886
I know now.

202
00:17:41,496 --> 00:17:43,558
<i>There is another place
across the sea.</i>

203
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:44,967
It's where I'm from,

204
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:48,144
And I'm gonna go there.
I'm gonna go home.

205
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,123
Who--who told you that?

206
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:51,319
My mother!

207
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:55,254
I'm your mother.

208
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:56,926
You killed my mother.

209
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,742
Jacob...

210
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,539
She was your mother, too.

211
00:18:05,891 --> 00:18:09,483
<i>We don't belong here.
We don't belong with her.</i>

212
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:11,482
Come with me.

213
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:20,038
No.

214
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,462
My love, you need to know this.

215
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,263
Whatever you have been told,

216
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:31,426
You will never be able
to leave this island.

217
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:32,569
That's not true.

218
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:35,556
And one day, I can prove it.

219
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,538
Do you think he'll come back?

220
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:12,487
No.

221
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:17,788
He said you killed our mother.

222
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,183
Is that true?

223
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,674
Yes.

224
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:29,987
If I had let her live,

225
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:33,302
She would have taken
you back to her people,

226
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,966
And those people are bad,
Jacob--very bad.

227
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,798
I-I couldn't let you
become one of them.

228
00:19:42,854 --> 00:19:44,919
I needed you to stay good.

229
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,482
<i>Am I good, mother?</i>

230
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:54,162
Yes. Of course you are.

231
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,427
Then why do you love
him more than me?

232
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:12,330
I love you in-
in different ways.

233
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:19,275
Will you stay with me, Jacob?

234
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,170
Please?

235
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:29,250
Yes.

236
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,778
For a while.

237
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:56,103
What do you think?

238
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:00,718
It's very nice, Jacob.

239
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,951
Are you all right?

240
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,022
I'm just tired.

241
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:33,925
She know you visit me?

242
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:37,419
She never asks about you.

243
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:39,660
<i>Then I'm sorry I asked
about her.</i>

244
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,869
Why do you watch us, Jacob?

245
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:55,398
I watch because I wanna
know if mother's right.

246
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:56,727
Right about what?

247
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,442
About them.

248
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, you mean my people.

249
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,166
You wanna know if they're bad.

250
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,162
That woman may be insane,

251
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:09,147
But she's most definitely
right about that.

252
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:11,929
I don't know.
They don't seem so bad to me.

253
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:13,443
Well, that's easy
for you to say,

254
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,701
Looking down at us
from above. Trust me.

255
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,990
I've lived among
them for 30 years.

256
00:22:20,063 --> 00:22:24,182
They're greedy, manipulative,
untrustworthy...

257
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:26,846
And selfish.

258
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,386
Then why are you with them?

259
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,479
They're a means to an end.

260
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,556
What end?

261
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:44,562
I'm leaving, Jacob.

262
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,998
I found a way off the island.
No, it's impossible.

263
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:51,284
<i>There is no way off the island.</i>

264
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,418
There are very smart
men among us--

265
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,038
Men who are curious
about how things work.

266
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:28,090
Together, we have discovered
places all over this island

267
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:31,263
Where metal behaves strangely.

268
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:33,593
When we find one of these sites,

269
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,050
We dig.

270
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,340
And this time we
found something.

271
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,815
Come with me, Jacob, please.

272
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,807
What are you gonna
do when she dies?

273
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:49,794
She's never gonna die.

274
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,843
Jacob, everything dies.

275
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:53,940
Well, I don't wanna
leave this island.

276
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:55,843
It's my home.

277
00:23:58,189 --> 00:23:59,798
Well, it's not mine.

278
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:09,838
Where were you?

279
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:13,750
You know where I was.

280
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,662
What did he say to you, Jacob?

281
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:24,182
He said he's finally found
a way to leave the island.

282
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:24,778
May I join you?

283
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:28,549
Yes.

284
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:41,064
How are you?

285
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:42,956
I'm worried.

286
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,005
Well, mother, you should be.

287
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:48,994
I've spent 30 years
searching for that place

288
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:50,117
You brought me as a child--

289
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:52,610
That... Waterfall with
that beautiful light.

290
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:55,349
I've walked this
island from end to end,

291
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:57,481
Not once coming
close to finding it.

292
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:00,009
But then I began to think,

293
00:26:00,221 --> 00:26:02,492
What if the light
underneath the island--

294
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:05,001
What if I could get to
it from someplace else?

295
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,465
Figuring out how to reach
it took a very long time.

296
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,186
The people with you-
they saw this, too?

297
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:17,230
Yes. They have some
very interesting ideas

298
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:18,450
About what to do with it.

299
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,009
<i>Do with it? You don't
have any idea wh--</i>

300
00:26:21,161 --> 00:26:24,442
I have no idea because you
wouldn't tell me, mother.

301
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,136
What is that?

302
00:26:59,873 --> 00:27:01,017
It's a wheel.

303
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,018
We're going to
make an opening...

304
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:07,413
One much bigger than this one.

305
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:10,219
And then I'm going
to attach that wheel

306
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:11,573
To a system we're building--

307
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:16,021
A system that channels
the water and the light.

308
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,257
And then I'm going to turn it.

309
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:19,944
And when I do...

310
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:25,097
I'll finally be able
to leave this place.

311
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:29,293
How do you know all this?
How do you know it will work?

312
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:30,753
I'm special...

313
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,222
<i>Mother.</i>

314
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,026
Please don't do this.

315
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:38,582
Don't go.

316
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:40,138
<i>I have to go.</i>

317
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:43,641
Why? Because I
don't belong here.

318
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,710
Then I suppose this is good-bye.

319
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,293
Good-bye, mother.

320
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:30,803
I am so sorry.

321
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,277
Aah!

322
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:35,990
Uhh!

323
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:49,950
Jacob.

324
00:28:54,865 --> 00:28:55,833
It's time.

325
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:03,545
Something happened, didn't it?

326
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,738
Yes. I had to say
good-bye to your brother.

327
00:29:06,115 --> 00:29:07,057
You're letting him go?

328
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:10,046
I don't have a choice.
It's what he wants.

329
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,924
Do you recognize this place?

330
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:19,625
Yes.

331
00:29:20,142 --> 00:29:21,764
Do you remember what
I showed you here?

332
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,394
The light.

333
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:29,253
You're going to protect it now.

334
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,423
What's down there?

335
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:39,157
Life. Death.

336
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,116
Rebirth.

337
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,068
It's the source,
the heart of the island.

338
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,769
Just promise me...

339
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:59,461
<i>No matter what you do,
you won't ever go down there.</i>

340
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:05,413
Would I die?

341
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,662
It'd be worse than dying Jacob.

342
00:30:08,636 --> 00:30:09,781
Much worse.

343
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:40,838
Here.

344
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:42,145
Drink this.

345
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,481
What happens if I do?

346
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:46,526
You'll accept the responsibility

347
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:50,913
That you will protect this
place for as long as you can.

348
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:54,261
And then you'll have to
find your replacement.

349
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,454
I don't want to
protect this place.

350
00:30:55,596 --> 00:30:57,453
Someone has to. I don't care.

351
00:30:57,571 --> 00:30:59,774
My time is over.
Why? Why is your time over?

352
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:01,097
It has to be you, Jacob.

353
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:03,320
<i>No, it doesn't.
You wanted it to be him.</i>

354
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,037
But now I'm all you have.

355
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:14,888
It was always supposed
to be you, Jacob.

356
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,061
I see that now,
and one day you'll see it, too,

357
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:20,345
But until then...

358
00:31:22,294 --> 00:31:24,478
You don't really have a choice.

359
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:28,861
Please.

360
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:31,637
Take the cup and drink.

361
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,158
Now you and I...

362
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:07,665
Are the same.

363
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:05,636
Storm comin'.

364
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,144
Yes, there is.

365
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:13,391
You should go, get some firewood

366
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:15,488
Before it rains.

367
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:20,355
Jacob?

368
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:24,036
Be careful.

369
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:26,143
I'll see you back home.

370
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:01,284
Why wouldn't you let
me leave, mother?

371
00:36:02,235 --> 00:36:05,436
Because I... I love you.

372
00:36:09,351 --> 00:36:10,881
Thank you.

373
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:33,765
Jacob.

374
00:36:34,046 --> 00:36:35,000
What'd you do?

375
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:36,576
Wait. Listen.

376
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,163
What did you do? No.

377
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,648
What did you do?! You have--

378
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:57,843
Don't. Jacob, don't do this.

379
00:36:59,187 --> 00:37:01,668
She burned them. She was crazy.

380
00:37:01,813 --> 00:37:02,951
She burned them all!

381
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:06,585
You can't kill me, Jacob.
She made it that way.

382
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:07,579
You can't!

383
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,687
Don't worry, brother.
I'm not going to kill you.

384
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,675
Uhh!

385
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:28,080
She brought you back here? Yes.

386
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:29,539
Why would she?

387
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:32,163
Because I ha to protect it now.

388
00:37:34,516 --> 00:37:35,567
Aah!

389
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,023
You want to find the light?

390
00:37:38,384 --> 00:37:39,900
You want to leave
this place, brother?

391
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,413
Then go.

392
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:42,219
Uhh!

393
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:27,090
Who are they?
Where'd they come from?

394
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:30,588
Didn't you guys shoot a
polar bear last week? Yeah.

395
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:32,287
<i>Where'd that come from?</i>

396
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,735
Hello? Anybody there?

397
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:55,840
Who were these men?

398
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,456
Actually, one of them's female.

399
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,056
Our very own Adam and eve.

400
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:13,751
Gd bye, brother.

401
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:21,336
Good-bye.

402
00:41:21,336 --> 00:41:22,336
