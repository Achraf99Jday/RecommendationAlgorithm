1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,770
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,280
we are now beginning our final descent
into Los Angeles International Airport.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,390
Mr. Sheperd, there seems to be
a mix up involving your coffin.

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,000
They lost my father.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,670
He died in Australia a couple days ago.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,900
Who are you?

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,670
Jacob sent us.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,280
He said you would help our friend.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,910
Get him to the spring.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,720
What happened?

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,950
He says you have to give
your friend this pill.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,860
- What is in it?
- Poison.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,900
Why would you people wanna kill Sayid?

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,000
Here is a darkness growing in him.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,200
How can you be sure of that?

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Because it happened to your sister.

17
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,400
Claire?

18
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,880
Hey, mom.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,520
Have they found him yet?

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,880
No, I... I called a couple hours ago,

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,050
and they think the coffin
was checked through Berlin.

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,490
How do you lose a body?

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,760
I don't know, mom, but
there's nothing we can do

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,240
- except for wait for more information.
- I don't want to wait, Jack.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,470
How am I supposed to get anything done?

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,780
I can't even find his
will. Papers everywhere.

27
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
Look, mom, I'll come
over in a couple hours,

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,750
and we'll find it together. Okay?

29
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,670
Okay.

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,940
Good. Now, mom, when did I
have my appendix taken out?

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,550
You were 7 or 8 maybe.

32
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,850
You collapsed at school.

33
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,990
Your father wanted to
do the procedure himself,

34
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,360
but they wouldn't let him.
You don't remember that?

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Yeah, I...

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,290
I guess I do.

37
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,600
Oh, damn it. Mom, I gotta go.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,330
Well, don't forget to...

39
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,670
Sorry I'm late.

40
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,500
I thought I had enough Tim to
go home and change after work.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,670
Don't worry about it.

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,400
I'm sorry, David. Okay?

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,100
Okay, dad.

44
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,350
I was afraid you'd left.

45
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,190
Is leaving an option?

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,460
Everything is an option.

47
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,970
But I would have to stop you.

48
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,600
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Your friends... Ford
and Austen and Kwon...

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,040
They're not coming back, are they?

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,510
No, probably not.

52
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,580
I appreciate your honesty.

53
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,530
Tie again, dude.

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,530
Shocker. That's it for me.

55
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,230
You hungry?

56
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,570
Are you?

57
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,070
I could eat.

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,090
Hey, man.

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,350
Do you know if there's,
like, a kitchen in this place?

60
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,350
It's all the way down the hallway, Hugo.

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,490
Dude, what are you doing here?

62
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,590
I'm here because I need you.

63
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,730
For what?

64
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,510
You should probably get a pen.

65
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,470
You're gonna have to
write a few things down.

66
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,270
- What kind of things?
- Someone is coming to the island.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,070
I need you to help them find it.

68
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,530
Hooked up the cable in here

69
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,730
so you can watch the Red Sox if you want.

70
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,660
Thanks.

71
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,570
You reading this?

72
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,900
Yeah.

73
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,120
I used to read this to
you when you were little.

74
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,420
You always wanted to hear
about kitty and snowdrop.

75
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,650
They were Alice's...

76
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,290
David.

77
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
David.

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,940
What are you listening to?

79
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,280
You haven't heard of them.

80
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,950
I'm just trying to have a
conversation with you, David.

81
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,950
Why?

82
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,850
We see each other, like,
once a month. Can't we just...

83
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,340
Get through it?

84
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,720
Damn it.

85
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,100
Yeah, mom?

86
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,090
Where are you? I thought
you were coming over.

87
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,190
Yeah, I'm sorry. Um, I'm
heading out right now.

88
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,330
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

89
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,830
I have to go over to
your grandmother's house.

90
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,900
- You wanna come?
- No, thanks.

91
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,890
All right, well, I'll
be back in about an hour.

92
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,670
And then we'll eat, okay?

93
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,580
Great.

94
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,630
Jack.

95
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,820
Sayid.

96
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,990
Why are they all staring at me?

97
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,590
Just ignore them.

98
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,160
Look, you told me these people
think I have an infection,

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,700
that they wanted to give
me some mysterious pill

100
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,670
that you instructed me not to take.

101
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,370
And then you disappeared.

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,970
What are you hiding from me?

103
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,210
The pill was poison.

104
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,410
They wanted me to kill you.

105
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,980
Whatever it is they think happened to you,

106
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,740
Sayid...

107
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,030
They say it happened to someone else, too.

108
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,320
Who?

109
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,000
Claire!

110
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,550
I'm gonna get you out of there.

111
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,960
How long have you been out here?

112
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,630
Since you all left.

113
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,900
How long ago was that?

114
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,800
Three years.

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
I gotta get you somewhere safe.

116
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,440
Come on. You think you can walk?

117
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,670
I don't know.

118
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,910
Okay. Okay. Okay.

119
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,170
What are you doing?

120
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,270
Nothing.

121
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,710
I'm just... you know, looking...

122
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,770
cause I'm a big fan of temples

123
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,280
and, like, history...

124
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,840
and Indiana Jones' stuff.

125
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,450
You shouldn't be here.

126
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,410
Go back to the courtyard.

127
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,720
Tell him you can do what you want.

128
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,590
Tell him you're a candidate.

129
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,990
I'm a candidate, and I can do what I want.

130
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,890
Who told you that?

131
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,330
Doesn't matter.

132
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,070
Why don't you go back to the courtyard?

133
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,070
- What'd he say?
- You don't want to know.

134
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,780
What are you doing here, Hugo?

135
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,850
Going through the secret
passageway like you told me.

136
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,610
I told you to bring Jack with you.

137
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,300
You ever tried to get
Jack to do something?

138
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,620
It's, like, impossible.
I can just go myself.

139
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,180
You have to bring him with you, Hugo.

140
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,040
Okay, it's bad enough you already
made me write down way too much stuff,

141
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,020
and I just lied to a samurai.

142
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,920
Look, if you have any
idea on how to get Jack

143
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,290
to go on your little
adventure, I'm listening, dude.

144
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,670
Be cool, man.

145
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,710
Act natural.

146
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,010
What?

147
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,110
Dude, keep your voice down.

148
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,450
I'm gonna get up and go.

149
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:11,750
Wait ten seconds and then follow me.

150
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,920
Follow you where?

151
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,790
I found a secret tunnel
that leads out to the jungle.

152
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,990
You found a secret tunnel.

153
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,130
Well... Jacob told me about it.

154
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,430
He said you and me have to go

155
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,330
I'm not going anywhere, Hurley.

156
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,730
I told him you'd say that,
so he told me to tell you...

157
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,430
You have what it takes.

158
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,880
What did you just say?

159
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,910
I said, "you have what it takes,"

160
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,820
he said you'd know what that meant.

161
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,480
- Where is he?
- What?

162
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,220
Jacob. Where is he?

163
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,950
He's kind of dead.

164
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,820
He turns up whenever he wants,

165
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,190
like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

166
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,760
But if you wanna talk to him,

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,850
he's where we're going, dude.

168
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,590
Well, then let's go see Jacob.

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,310
Claire?

170
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,100
Come on. Get in there!

171
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,840
Well, look what I found... one
of the men who tried to kill you.

172
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,040
He was just pretending
to be dead, but he wasn't.

173
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,400
Now we get to talk to him.

174
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,240
You wanna talk to me about what?

175
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,940
About where you're hiding my son.

176
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,520
Gotta get that cleaned up.

177
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,550
If there's one thing
that'll kill you around here,

178
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,750
it's infection.

179
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,690
I'll be right back. Don't move, okay?

180
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,890
Claire?

181
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,560
Have you been out here all
this time... by yourself?

182
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Oh, I'm... I'm not by myself.

183
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,270
Look, we've gotta get out of here now.

184
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,670
It's okay. I know her.

185
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,980
No, I know her.

186
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,980
You have any idea what
she's gonna do to us?

187
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,850
If we don't get out of here
now, she's gonna kill us both.

188
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,530
Which way?

189
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,930
It's this way.

190
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,110
It's me.

191
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,080
Jack!

192
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
I almost shot you.

193
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,420
I noticed. What are you doing out here?

194
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,650
Where's, uh, where's Jin and Sawyer?

195
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,760
Jin went back to the temple, and, um...

196
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,430
Sawyer's on his own.

197
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,330
Hey, Kate, there's a secret
door to get back in the temple,

198
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,790
on the north wall behind the big tree.

199
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,300
Yeah, I'm not going back to the temple.

200
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,630
I'm going to find Claire.

201
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,090
- Kate...
- I'm going back to the beach camp.

202
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,290
She might still be there, Jack.

203
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,260
She's not up at the beach.

204
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,890
The people at the temple
said that something...

205
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,330
Something happened to her.

206
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,010
Do they know where she is?

207
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,870
I don't know. They didn't say.

208
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,320
I... I have to find her.

209
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,220
Kate, wait. Wait.

210
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,560
Come with us, and then we'll all
go back to the temple together.

211
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,130
Dude, Jacob said just you and me.

212
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,200
She's kind of not invited.

213
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,270
I'm inviting her.

214
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,990
Jack, it's okay.

215
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,270
Just go. It's all right.

216
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,340
I hope you find what you're looking for.

217
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,960
We're never going to find it.

218
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,630
Take it easy, mom.

219
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,090
It's somewhere in here, and we'll find it.

220
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
It's like a needle in a damned haystack.

221
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,670
Why your father wouldn't just
give his will to his lawyer

222
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,170
is beyond me.

223
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,870
Well... why would he
make it easier on us now?

224
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,410
You want a drink?

225
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,540
Uh, no. No, no thanks.

226
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,480
Good for you.

227
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,680
How's David holding up?

228
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,890
What?

229
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,120
He was really upset at the funeral.

230
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,260
He was?

231
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,990
He didn't tell you?

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,600
No. No, he didn't.

233
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,830
Communication is not
one of his strong suits.

234
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,800
Well, it runs in the family.

235
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,070
When you were David's age,

236
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,600
you father was lucky

237
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,270
if he could get more than
one word out of you at a time.

238
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,670
Well, that's because I
was terrified of him, mom.

239
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,640
How do you know David
isn't terrified of you?

240
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,170
Why would he be?

241
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,940
I don't know, Jack.

242
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,980
Maybe you should ask him.

243
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,990
Found it.

244
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,690
"Last will and testament."

245
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,270
Jack?

246
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,940
Yeah?

247
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,580
Did you father ever mention

248
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,610
a... Claire Littleton?

249
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,440
Psst. Hey.

250
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,540
Untie me before she comes back in.

251
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,040
Why would I do that?

252
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,510
Are you not listening to
me? She's gonna kill us both.

253
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,880
Loosen my ropes, and
when she comes back in,

254
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,580
I'll snap her neck.

255
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,310
So...

256
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,180
I'm, uh, really sorry
you got stuck in my trap.

257
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,290
Gonna get you all cleaned up now, okay?

258
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,480
It's all right. You're doing good.

259
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,970
Well, at least you don't
have to stitch yourself up.

260
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,770
I had to do that once.
They shot me right here.

261
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,440
You've been living here since we left?

262
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,310
Not always here.

263
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,950
I, um, had to move around
quite a lot to hide from them.

264
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,690
Lucky I'm still alive.

265
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
What are you gonna do with him?

266
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,810
He's gonna tell me where
they've got my baby...

267
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,240
- Where... where they've got Aaron.
- We don't have your kid.

268
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,120
You're lying, okay? I know you have him.

269
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,720
That's crazy. We never took your...

270
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,250
- Shut up.
- Claire, how do you know they took him?

271
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,950
- How can you be so sure?
- How can I be so sure?

272
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,330
Okay, well, first my father told me,

273
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,130
and then my friend told
me, so I'm pretty damn sure.

274
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,500
Your friend? Who is your friend?

275
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,090
My friend.

276
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,830
You're still my friend, aren't you, Jin?

277
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,770
Yes.

278
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,440
Yes, of course.

279
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,810
Good.

280
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,340
I'm glad.

281
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,140
All done. Good as new.

282
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,650
Okay.

283
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,820
So...

284
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,490
Now it's your turn.

285
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,300
Sorry, dude.

286
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,740
For what?

287
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,840
You know, what happened back there,

288
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
wrecking your game with Kate.

289
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,340
Don't worry about it.

290
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,500
There's nothing left to wreck.

291
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Yeah? Whatever happened to you guys?

292
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,680
I thought you guys were gonna get married

293
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,810
- and have, like, a dozen kids.
- Guess I wasn't cut out for it.

294
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,180
Really? I think you'd make a great dad.

295
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,450
I'd make a terrible dad.

296
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,910
What is that?

297
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,080
Asthma inhaler.

298
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,610
Dude, it's Shannon's.

299
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,850
We're at the caves.

300
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,050
The caves we used to live in?

301
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,230
I totally forgot these were in here, man.

302
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,500
Wait a sec.

303
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,550
What if we time traveled again

304
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,820
to, like, dinosaur times,

305
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,780
and then we died and
then we got buried here?

306
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,020
What if these skeletons are us?

307
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,990
What's that?

308
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I ever tell you how I found this place?

309
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,330
You were looking for water, right?

310
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,150
No.

311
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,870
I was chasing the ghost of my dead father.

312
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,340
He led me here.

313
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,100
That was his coffin...

314
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,850
before I smashed it to pieces.

315
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,020
Why'd you do that?

316
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,340
Because he wasn't in it.

317
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,000
David?

318
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,800
I got us a pizza.

319
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,540
Hey, dinner's...

320
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,700
This is David. Leave a message.

321
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,600
David, it... it's me again.

322
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,540
Listen, uh...

323
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,570
If I did something to upset you,

324
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,090
I am really, really sorry.

325
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,390
Uh, I'm gonna drive over
to your mother's house.

326
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,180
I know that she's out of
town. So if you are there,

327
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,610
just... just don't go anywhere, okay?

328
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,080
Whatever I did, I'm... I'm sorry.

329
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,860
David?

330
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,370
Uh, yes, this message
is for David Shepherd.

331
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,250
Hi, David.

332
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,940
This is Dr. Summerland from
the Williams conservatory.

333
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
Just calling to confirm your slot

334
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,740
next Friday the 24th at 7:00 p.m.

335
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,510
We look forward to
seeing you, and good luck.

336
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,120
Hey, David. It's dad.

337
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,620
I'm, uh...

338
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,190
I'm in Sydney, Australia.

339
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,030
Something...

340
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,070
Something happened, and I...

341
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,470
I just needed to hear your voice.

342
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,110
Um, I guess I'll try you again later.

343
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,040
I love you.

344
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,510
This is cool, dude.

345
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,760
Very old school.

346
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,280
What?

347
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,090
You know, you and me...

348
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,330
Trekking through the jungle...

349
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,200
on our way to do something
that we don't quite understand.

350
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,730
Good times.

351
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,640
You mind if I ask you somethin'?

352
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,060
Sure.

353
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,040
Why'd you come back?

354
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,480
You know... to the island.

355
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,910
Why'd you come back?

356
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
Back in L.A.,

357
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,880
Jacob hopped into the back of my cab

358
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,920
and told me I was supposed to, so I came.

359
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,690
What?

360
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,680
If you have a better
reason for coming back,

361
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,030
let's hear it, man.

362
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,180
I came back here because I was broken.

363
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,890
And I was stupid enough to
think this place would fix me.

364
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,060
Dude, I'm sorry.

365
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,240
How much further we got, Hurley?

366
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,660
It's not far. It's not far at all.

367
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,100
It's right there.

368
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,440
It's a lighthouse.

369
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,140
I don't understand.

370
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,500
How is it that we've never seen it before?

371
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,410
I guess we weren't looking for it.

372
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,680
So tell me where my son is.

373
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,590
I don't know where your son is.

374
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,710
Stop covering for them.

375
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,320
They're not gonna help you anymore.

376
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,620
All you've gotta do is
just tell me the truth.

377
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,540
I am telling you the truth.

378
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,630
Look, we don't have your kid.

379
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,290
We never had your kid!

380
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,630
Stop lying to me!

381
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,500
Your people took me to
the temple and tortured me.

382
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,910
No, we captured you because
you were out here in the jungle

383
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,720
picking our people off.

384
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,200
Claire, wait!

385
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,960
Hold on.

386
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
"Hold on"?

387
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,000
Jin, they stuck me with
needles! They branded me!

388
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,150
And if I hadn't been able
to escape from the temple,

389
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,260
they would've killed me.

390
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,470
No, you're not remembering things right.

391
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,440
Oh, shut up, okay?!

392
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,030
You've got one more
chance. One more chance.

393
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,780
Just tell me where my son is.

394
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,680
I don't know where your damn kid is!

395
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,370
Kate took him!

396
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,160
Kate took Aaron.

397
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,230
She took him with her
when she left the island.

398
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,430
What do you mean she took him?

399
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,440
He's been with her... with Kate...

400
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,670
for the past three years.

401
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,220
Aaron is 3.

402
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
He's telling you the truth.

403
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
We had nothing to do with this.

404
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,650
So if you just untie me,

405
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,050
I'll leave,

406
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,360
and I promise I will never
tell anyone I ever even saw you.

407
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,830
Just untie me.

408
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,720
Pretty cool, huh?

409
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,110
Jacob's in here?

410
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,140
I guess so.

411
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,380
But first we gotta go upstairs
and turn this thing on.

412
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,270
It doesn't say anything on your
arm about the door being jammed?

413
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,350
No.

414
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,360
After you.

415
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,830
Thank you.

416
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,100
Is that your son?

417
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,370
Yes.

418
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,480
He's really good.

419
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,130
They are too young to
have this kind of pressure,

420
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,920
aren't they?

421
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,330
Yes. Yes, they are.

422
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,270
It's hard to watch and be unable to help.

423
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,080
Your son has a gift.

424
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,020
How long has he been playing?

425
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,850
I...

426
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,250
I don't know.

427
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,200
Dude, this is cool.

428
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,310
Must've built this to help
ships get here and stuff.

429
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,010
I guess they used a mirror 'cause...

430
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,610
Electricity hadn't been invented yet.

431
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,250
- Where's Jacob?
- Uh, he's not here yet.

432
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,640
Let's get started.

433
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,590
Tell me when it gets to 108 degrees.

434
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,030
Stop.

435
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,190
Did you see that?

436
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,260
Did I see what?

437
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,660
The mirror. I saw something in the mirror.

438
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,940
It's just ocean.

439
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,360
Turn it to 23 degrees.

440
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,890
Oh, I... I don't think Jacob wants...

441
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,440
What? What is that?

442
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,370
It's my house.

443
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,340
It's the house I grew up in.

444
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,310
That's weird.

445
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,050
I haven't lived in that
house since I was a kid.

446
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,690
He's been watching us.

447
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,310
The whole time, all of us.

448
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,420
He's been watching us.

449
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,120
Hurley.

450
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,390
Where's Jacob?

451
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,620
I don't know.

452
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,050
You said that he would be here.

453
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:59,240
Well, I was just... kind of assuming.

454
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,300
Hurley...

455
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,790
I wanna know why he was watching me

456
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,330
I wanna know, so you're
gonna ask him right now.

457
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,300
It doesn't work like that. I told you.

458
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,670
He just kinda shows up
whenever he feels like it.

459
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,320
What are you doing?

460
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,310
- Why was he watching me?
- I don't know.

461
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,100
- Why is my name written down on this thing?
- He didn't tell me.

462
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,580
- What does he want from me?
- I was supposed to do...

463
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,550
What does he want from me?!

464
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,300
I don't know, Jack!

465
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:31,940
Don't!

466
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,130
You were great in there.

467
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:13,680
You saw me?

468
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,420
I missed a couple of notes.

469
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,900
It sounded perfect from
where I was standing.

470
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,900
David, you scared the hell out of me.

471
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,460
You were at grandma's.

472
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,930
I thought I could get back to
your place before you got home.

473
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,840
I didn't even know you were still playing.

474
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,080
I made mom promise not to tell you.

475
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,680
Why?

476
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,350
It was always such a big deal to you.

477
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,050
You used to sit and watch me practice.

478
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:56,660
You were so... into it.

479
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,000
I didn't tell you I was
coming here because...

480
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,440
I didn't want you to see me fail.

481
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,550
You know, when I was your age,

482
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,050
my father didn't want
to see me fail either.

483
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,850
He used to say to me that...

484
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,160
He said that I didn't have what it takes.

485
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,100
I spent my whole life
carrying that around with me.

486
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,910
And I don't ever want
you to feel that way.

487
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,280
I will always love you,

488
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,720
no matter what you do.

489
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,790
In... in my eyes, you can never fail.

490
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,590
I just wanna be a part of your life.

491
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,970
Okay.

492
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,710
I've got some pizza back
at the house. You hungry?

493
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,240
Sure.

494
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,080
Good.

495
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,690
Let's go home.

496
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,500
How'd it go?

497
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,370
Where were you, man?

498
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,820
Doesn't matter. He wouldn't
have been able to see me anyway.

499
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, well, I'd you had told me that

500
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,380
and had, like, explained everything,

501
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,740
then maybe Jack wouldn't have freaked out

502
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,450
and smashed your mirror
into a billion pieces.

503
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,450
Thanks for the seven years
of bad luck, by the way.

504
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,280
You got ink on your forehead.

505
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,160
I have ink on my forehead?
That's all you have to say?!

506
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,220
Jack broke your lighthouse, dude!

507
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,830
Mission unaccomplished.

508
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,860
Whoever you said we needed
to help get to the island

509
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,390
- is totally screwed.
- Oh, I'm sure they'll find some other way.

510
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,090
So...

511
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,420
Everything you wanted
me to do didn't get done,

512
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:23,160
and... you don't even care?

513
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:29,730
Wait a minute.

514
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,100
Did you want Jack to see
what was in that mirror?

515
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,030
Why?

516
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,310
It was the only way for him to
understand how important he is.

517
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,510
Well, if that was your plan,
I think it backfired, man.

518
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,980
Jack is here because
he has to do something.

519
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,150
He can't be told what that
is. He's gotta find it himself.

520
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,270
Sometimes you can just hop
in the back of someone's cab

521
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,590
and tell 'em what they're supposed to do.

522
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:00,390
Other times,

523
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,420
you have to let him look
out at the ocean for a while.

524
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,370
Well, next time, how about you
tell me everything up front?

525
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,170
I'm not big on secret plans, okay?

526
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,340
I couldn't risk you not coming, Hugo.

527
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,860
I had to get you and Jack

528
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,600
- as far away from that temple as I possibly could.
- What? Why?

529
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,290
'Cause someone's coming there.

530
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,920
Someone bad.

531
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,060
Dude, we have to warn them.

532
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,330
You can't warn them, Hugo.

533
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,530
I'm sorry. It's too late.

534
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,600
Look, if I didn't kill
him, he would've killed me.

535
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm glad you didn't untie him.

536
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,510
Claire, please, whatever
you're thinking...

537
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,040
Why'd you say that Kate was raising Aaron?

538
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,230
I was lying.

539
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,640
Why?

540
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,480
Because I wanted to save his life.

541
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,380
But you were right.

542
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,320
The others have your baby.

543
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,490
Aaron is at the temple.

544
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,590
I know because I saw him there.

545
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,960
But you'll need me to get to him.

546
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,860
How do we get in?

547
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,030
There's a secret way. No one will see us.

548
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,300
Thank you, Jin. Thank you.

549
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,950
And I'm so glad to know you were lying.

550
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,760
Because if what you said was the truth,

551
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,420
if Kate was raising Aaron?

552
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,550
I'd kill her.

553
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,080
Am I interrupting?

554
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,350
John?

555
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,930
That's not John. This is my friend.

556
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:25,931
