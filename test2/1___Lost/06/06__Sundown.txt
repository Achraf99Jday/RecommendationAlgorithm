1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,634
<i>Previously on "Lost":</i>

2
00:00:01,664 --> 00:00:03,439
You're the son of a bitch who shot my kid.

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,690
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,982
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,140
Your friend is dead.

6
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:17,314
Jack!

7
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:20,867
What happened?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,536
What is it you want?

9
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:27,092
I don't have any secrets.
Why are you doing this?

10
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,277
You have to give your friend this pill.

11
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:34,740
- What is in it?
- Poison.

12
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,437
Why would you people wanna kill Sayid?

13
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:38,544
There is a darkness growing in him.

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,486
And once it reaches his heart,
everything your friend once was

15
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:43,616
will be gone.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,315
What are you hiding from me?

17
00:00:45,316 --> 00:00:49,100
The pill was poison. They
wanted me to kill you.

18
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,700
The meter doesn't stop
until you get out, pal.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,934
Keep the change.

20
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,054
Sayid.

21
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:31,867
Hello, Nadia.

22
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,107
You're here!

23
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,067
Where were you, Uncle Sayid?

24
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:42,607
- I was in Sydney.
- Where's Sydney?

25
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:44,203
In Australia.

26
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,348
You bring flowers for my wife?

27
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,116
I'll give them to you, if you want.

28
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,183
It's good to see you, Sayid.

29
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,551
It's good to see you, too, brother.

30
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,515
Come.

31
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:08,783
Uncle Sayid, what did you
bring us from Australia?

32
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,309
Go look in my bag. It's on the couch.

33
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:16,681
It's good you came,
Sayid. They've missed you.

34
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,807
We're lucky he
even showed up--

35
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:23,187
The world traveler off on
his exotic business trips.

36
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:25,333
Translating contracts for an oil company

37
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:26,622
is hardly exotic...

38
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:28,999
And it's painfully dull.

39
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:32,768
There's the very little invention
in the world of dry cleaning.

40
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:36,985
He's being modest. Omar's
just opened up a new store.

41
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,952
Congratulations.

42
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:42,986
I thought we talked about cell
phones at the dinner table.

43
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:48,457
Dinner is over. This is business.

44
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:52,452
Yes?

45
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:00,093
Did you get my letters?

46
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,494
Yes.

47
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,987
You never wrote back.

48
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,842
These are awesome! Thanks!

49
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:12,912
You're welcome.

50
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:17,168
Mommy, we found a picture
of you in Uncle Sayid's bag.

51
00:03:45,314 --> 00:03:47,226
I want to talk to you.

52
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:50,684
I want some answers.

53
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,382
Answers to what?

54
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:55,711
Let's start with that machine.

55
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:02,867
You hooked me up to this thing,

56
00:04:05,548 --> 00:04:07,076
you stuck needles in me,

57
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,339
and you called it a test.

58
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:14,131
For every man, there is a scale.

59
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:19,127
On one side of the scale, there is good.

60
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:22,881
On the other
side-- Evil.

61
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,804
This machine tells us

62
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,846
how the scale is balanced.

63
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:32,397
And yours...

64
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,715
tipped the wrong way.

65
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,267
And that's why you tried to poison me?

66
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,055
Yes.

67
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,614
I think it would be best if you were dead.

68
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,744
You think you know me, but you don't.

69
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,870
I'm a good man.

70
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,639
So if you're
trying to kill me--

71
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,274
Go.

72
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,052
Leave this place.

73
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:18,687
Never come back.

74
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:48,970
Are you ready?

75
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:52,310
Why does it have to be me?

76
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,375
I mean, you could send Sawyer or Jin or...

77
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,370
- Do it yourself.
- If I could do it myself,

78
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,733
<i>I wouldn't be asking you, Claire.</i>

79
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:04,943
If I go in there,

80
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,378
I need to know you'll do what you said.

81
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,915
I want my son back.

82
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,069
I always do what I say.

83
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,781
Are you gonna hurt them?

84
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:24,874
Only the ones who won't listen.

85
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,440
"Sundown"

86
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:02,813
Aah! It's me.

87
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:03,869
Calm down.

88
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,516
What are you doing?

89
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:07,960
It's 2:30 in the morning.

90
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,370
Sayid, I'm in trouble.

91
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,806
What kind of trouble?

92
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:24,069
I borrowed money to open the second store.

93
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:26,549
But...

94
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,990
I didn't borrow it from the bank.

95
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:31,873
I paid the loan back,

96
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,608
but the man who
lent me this money--

97
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:36,405
He says I still owe him
interest every month...

98
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,592
for as long as I own my business.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,014
If you need money,

100
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,118
- I'll lend it to you-- -
I don't need money, Sayid.

101
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,495
I need you to convince these
people to leave me alone.

102
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,220
"Convince" them?

103
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,147
Sayid, don't forget who you're talking to.

104
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,679
I know what you did in the war.

105
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:58,314
You were an interrogator
for the Republican Guard.

106
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:04,191
<i>I know what kind of man you are.</i>

107
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:08,111
If you think I'm going to hurt someone

108
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,792
just because you made a
bad business decision--

109
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,307
Look, this is not about me!

110
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:14,506
<i>Our life savings-- It's
all gone, Sayid. All of it.</i>

111
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,693
We could lose our home.

112
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:17,678
<i>Please.</i>

113
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,871
Look... I know you care about Nadia.

114
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,151
If you care about
us-- About her...

115
00:09:29,126 --> 00:09:31,150
You will do this, Sayid.

116
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,014
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,649
I'm not that man anymore.

118
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,615
What are you doing?

119
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,677
I'm leaving.

120
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,235
I've been banished.

121
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,393
Banished? For what?

122
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,737
Apparently, I'm evil.

123
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,854
These people say I'm better off dead...

124
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:14,689
Which is surprising,

125
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,205
considering they were the
ones who saved my life.

126
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:21,186
Well, actually, they're not. They...

127
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,168
<i>They tried to save you, but...</i>

128
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,143
<i>You were dead, man.</i>

129
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,649
<i>For two hours.</i>

130
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,481
Trust me. When--
When you sat up,

131
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,538
they were just as
surprised as the rest of us.

132
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:38,976
So whatever brought you back,

133
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:40,549
it wasn't them.

134
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,556
Hold it.

135
00:10:47,099 --> 00:10:48,462
Stop! Don't shoot her!

136
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:56,743
What are you doing here?

137
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,611
He wants to see you.

138
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,931
Speak English.

139
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:07,460
Who wants to see me?

140
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,029
You know who.

141
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:13,126
If he wants to see me,
then tell him to come in.

142
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,184
<i>No, he wants you to go to him.</i>

143
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,114
He's waiting outside
beyond the outer wall.

144
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:18,075
I'm not a fool.

145
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:22,065
If I step outside this temple...

146
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:24,626
he'll kill me.

147
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:27,959
<i>Well, then maybe you should
send someone he won't kill.</i>

148
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:31,453
Stop her!

149
00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,108
Ah, that's gonna be a little difficult.

150
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,026
We can't find them.

151
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:48,137
Come on!

152
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,934
Come with me.

153
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,036
I thought you wanted me to leave.

154
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:07,830
Things have changed.

155
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,173
Your friends--
Shephard and Reyes--

156
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,162
Do you know where they went?

157
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:27,166
No, I don't.

158
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:32,784
Why is Claire here?

159
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,702
And what was she talking about?

160
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,331
She's a confused girl,

161
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,919
under the influence of an angry man.

162
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,068
What man?

163
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:47,907
For years,

164
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,573
he has been trapped.

165
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,270
But now, Jacob's gone.

166
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:54,772
He's free.

167
00:12:55,893 --> 00:13:00,496
This man will not stop
until he has destroyed

168
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:03,926
every living thing on this island.

169
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:07,002
He is evil incarnate.

170
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,849
<i>And you want me to speak to him?</i>

171
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:11,936
No.

172
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,203
I want you to kill him.

173
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:21,216
He will come to you as someone you know...

174
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,535
Someone who has died.

175
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:26,654
As soon as you see him,

176
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,810
plunge this deep into his chest.

177
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,498
If you allow him to speak,

178
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,349
it is already too late.

179
00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:39,695
Since I've been here,

180
00:13:40,316 --> 00:13:43,798
<i>I've been drowned, beaten
and tortured at your hands.</i>

181
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:46,993
Why would I ever do anything for you?

182
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:51,998
You said that there is
still good in your soul.

183
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,039
Then prove it.

184
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,092
Hey, wait up!

185
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:04,916
How long are you staying, Uncle Sayid?

186
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,069
Just a few more days.

187
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:11,679
I have to go to Toronto...

188
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:13,829
to work.

189
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,593
We like it when you're here.

190
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:18,354
Yeah, and Mommy likes it, too.

191
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,394
Okay. Be good.

192
00:14:43,706 --> 00:14:44,779
Sayid!

193
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,626
Omar!

194
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,183
Is my husband going to be all right?

195
00:14:58,218 --> 00:14:59,402
We're taking him into surgery now.

196
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:01,619
He's suffered a punctured lung
and some internal bleeding.

197
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:02,944
Do you know how this happened?

198
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,314
E.M.T's think he was mugged.

199
00:15:04,526 --> 00:15:06,343
I'll come get you as soon as he's stable.

200
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:10,693
- Sayid! Where are you going?
- Stay here with Omar.

201
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:13,408
This wasn't a mugging, was it?

202
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,604
Whatever you're thinking of doing...

203
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:18,801
Don't do it.

204
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:22,436
I don't want you to.

205
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,594
Please... just...

206
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:25,990
Go home.

207
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,840
Wait for the kids.

208
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:30,531
Make them feel safe, Sayid.

209
00:15:32,747 --> 00:15:34,073
Will you do that?

210
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,149
Hello?

211
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:50,371
Sayid?

212
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,382
Hello, Kate.

213
00:15:54,182 --> 00:15:55,311
Are you leaving?

214
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,701
I am not exactly sure.

215
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:01,500
What'd I miss?

216
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:02,934
Ask Miles.

217
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:16,406
Thank you.

218
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,246
Wow.

219
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:33,393
It's good to see you, too, Miles.

220
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:35,453
Sawyer sent you packing, huh?

221
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,647
I thought about going after him, too.

222
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:45,568
But, um, I knew he'd
just end up berating me

223
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,367
until I turned around and came back.

224
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:50,290
That pretty much what happened?

225
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,714
Pretty much.

226
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:55,964
Well...

227
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,097
Welcome back to the circus.

228
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:00,504
- What's going on in here?
- Well, let's see...

229
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:03,680
Oh, that Australian chick's back.

230
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:04,904
Wait. What?

231
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,933
You know, the-- the blonde.
One that had the baby.

232
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:10,487
- Claire?
- Right. Claire.

233
00:17:11,093 --> 00:17:13,909
She just strolled in
here a couple hours ago,

234
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,773
acting all weird.

235
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,017
Still hot, though.

236
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,006
Miles, where is she?

237
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:22,892
Where is she?

238
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,706
Hello, Sayid.

239
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,846
Now why'd you go and do that?

240
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,252
You want it back?

241
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:57,999
Take it. I won't bite.

242
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,491
What are you?

243
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,989
Well, Sayid, you seem to
have some idea about that,

244
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,453
considering that you
stabbed me in the chest

245
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,952
without even saying hello.

246
00:19:15,648 --> 00:19:17,029
<i>What did they tell you?</i>

247
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,418
They said you were evil incarnate.

248
00:19:21,264 --> 00:19:22,532
I feel sorry for you.

249
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,537
Why?

250
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:30,721
Dogen-- The man who
sent you out here--

251
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:33,779
Knew that you had no chance of killing me.

252
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:37,492
And he believed that I
would kill you if you tried.

253
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:42,160
And this wasn't the first time that

254
00:19:42,195 --> 00:19:44,584
he tried to get someone else
to do it for him, was it?

255
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,794
- No.
- Then shame on you

256
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:50,171
for being talked into it so easily.

257
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,663
<i>And what is it you are
trying to talk me into?</i>

258
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:55,817
Sorry?

259
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,695
You haven't killed me.

260
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,292
Clearly, there's something you want.

261
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:04,174
I just want you to deliver
a message, that's all.

262
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,175
Then why didn't you just
have Claire deliver it?

263
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,130
Because it would mean a
lot more coming from you.

264
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:11,742
Sayid, if you'll do this for me...

265
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,349
What if I told you that you
could have anything you wanted?

266
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:26,181
What if I said you could have
anything in the entire world?

267
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:31,432
I would tell you that the
only thing I ever wanted

268
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:34,273
died in my arms.

269
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,377
And I'll never see it again.

270
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,699
<i>But what if you could?</i>

271
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,808
Uh...

272
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,009
We had an unfortunate
incident involving a boomerang.

273
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,532
My apologies.

274
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:18,358
Oh, what time did the kids go to bed?

275
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:20,248
About two hours ago.

276
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:24,224
And what did you tell them?

277
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,911
Daddy had an accident,

278
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,484
but that he's going to be fine.

279
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:33,506
He's still recovering from surgery, but...

280
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,106
He's awake now.

281
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,084
Did he tell you about the loan?

282
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,787
- Look, I have money.
- No.

283
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:48,854
This is Omar's responsibility.

284
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:51,686
He brought this on himself.

285
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:00,624
Why didn't you want to be with me?

286
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:07,772
You carry my picture
around with you, Sayid.

287
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,048
If you care about me,

288
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,888
why did you push me towards your brother?

289
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:25,155
For the last 12 years,

290
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,454
I've been trying to wash my hands...

291
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:30,475
of all the horrible things I've done.

292
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,633
I can't be with you...

293
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,952
Because I don't deserve you.

294
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,710
What happened?

295
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,710
There is a man in the jungle...

296
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:13,769
about a mile south of
us, by the outer wall.

297
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:17,007
He sent me back here
to give you a message.

298
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:20,724
He wants you to know that Jacob is dead.

299
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,757
And because he's gone,

300
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:26,172
none of you have to stay here any longer.

301
00:23:26,373 --> 00:23:27,390
You're free.

302
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:29,883
The man that I met

303
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:32,754
is leaving the island forever.

304
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,597
And those of you who want to go with him

305
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,388
should leave the temple and join him.

306
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,612
You have until sundown to decide.

307
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,235
What happens at sundown if we stay?

308
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:46,712
You die.

309
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,911
Hey!

310
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,291
When did you get back?

311
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,869
- Are Ford and Kwon with you?
- Where is Claire?

312
00:24:02,904 --> 00:24:04,753
Okay, I need you to tell me
what I need to know before I--

313
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:06,629
I said, "Where is Claire?"

314
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:11,424
All right. Just let go of me, okay?

315
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:19,776
You have two minutes.

Kate?

324
00:24:49,742 --> 00:24:50,709
Are you okay?

325
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,380
I-I can't believe you're here.

326
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,044
Did they capture you, too?

327
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:57,879
No. No, they...

328
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,954
Why did they put you down here?

329
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,609
What happened?

330
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:04,831
They have my son, Kate. They have Aaron.

331
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:06,531
- They took him from me.
- No. No.

332
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:09,347
Claire, they don't have Aaron.

333
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,180
<i>I took him.</i>

334
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:14,843
I... What?

335
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,963
I took him off the island.

336
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:20,645
You were gone, and we couldn't find you.

337
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,482
So...

338
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,595
I raised him.

339
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:27,881
And...

340
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,843
He is the most beautiful,
amazing little boy.

341
00:25:32,957 --> 00:25:35,367
But I came back here to rescue you

342
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,576
so that you could be with him.

343
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:38,724
So that you guys could be together again.

344
00:25:41,485 --> 00:25:43,602
I'm not the one that
needs to be rescued, Kate.

345
00:25:44,766 --> 00:25:45,872
Time's up. Let's go.

346
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:47,929
No! No! Wait!

347
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:50,618
- No! Wait! Wait!
- You wanted to see her.

348
00:25:50,653 --> 00:25:51,536
So let's go.

349
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:54,494
He's coming, Kate.

350
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:57,990
He's coming, and they can't stop him!

351
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,569
All right, hurry!

352
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,274
Everybody, calm down!
It's going to be okay.

353
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,584
No! No! Wait!

354
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:09,958
Hang on!

355
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:11,247
Hey!

356
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:15,562
Hey, you created a panic
here. Our people are leaving.

357
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:17,175
I was asked to deliver a message,

358
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,301
and that's what I did.

359
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:20,921
What your people do now is up to them.

360
00:26:21,522 --> 00:26:24,635
Cindy, just wait. You're all safe here.

361
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:26,990
As long we stay in the
temple, he can't touch us.

362
00:26:27,025 --> 00:26:29,157
You heard him. Jacob's dead.

363
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:30,983
<i>And if it isn't safe here anymore,</i>

364
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,717
we can't take that risk.

365
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:36,477
Everyone, listen!

366
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:37,689
This is a bluff!

367
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:41,694
He can't come in! He can't come in!

368
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,069
Hey, what happened out there?

369
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,482
One minute, you're banished,

370
00:26:44,517 --> 00:26:46,180
the next you're telling
everyone they're gonna die.

371
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,090
That's the sum of it.

372
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:49,104
So are we getting out of here or what?

373
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:49,989
Not yet.

374
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,414
I have to return this.

375
00:27:04,442 --> 00:27:05,987
Going to pick up the kids?

376
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:09,723
Excuse me?

377
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,455
Why don't you get in the car?

378
00:27:15,825 --> 00:27:17,198
Get in, Sayid.

379
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:01,273
Why don't you have a seat?

380
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,821
Hey, you want some eggs?

381
00:28:07,222 --> 00:28:08,542
I can, uh...

382
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:11,505
make whatever you
want-- Fried, scrambled.

383
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,915
Uh, we still got that
poacher? Where's the poacher?

384
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,970
You want poached?

385
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:16,607
'Cause I could make you
some good poached eggs.

386
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:18,917
No, thank you.

387
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,143
I make good eggs.

388
00:28:22,256 --> 00:28:23,404
No?

389
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,033
All right.

390
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:35,672
Ah, bup, bup, bup, bup, ba, ba...

391
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:39,715
Martin Keamy.

392
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:44,130
Sayid Jarrah, but you already know that.

393
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:45,750
Uh, that, I do. Yeah.

394
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,340
Right.

395
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:53,809
So...

396
00:28:54,715 --> 00:28:55,780
Sayid...

397
00:28:56,754 --> 00:28:57,732
How's your brother doin'?

398
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:04,583
His brother got mugged right
out front of his own store.

399
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,119
It was just... terrible.

400
00:29:06,907 --> 00:29:08,757
Well, but at least this way, you know,

401
00:29:09,318 --> 00:29:11,811
you're still around to
take care of his family.

402
00:29:12,273 --> 00:29:14,069
<i>You do want to take care
of his family, don't you?</i>

403
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,210
Yes?

404
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:24,909
You know, I can see that you're
a very... direct guy, Sayid,

405
00:29:24,944 --> 00:29:26,265
so I'm just gonna get to the point.

406
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:29,378
Your brother-- He borrowed
some money from me,

407
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:30,581
and just like anybody

408
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,627
who borrows money or has a loan to pay,

409
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:33,658
he has to make payments.

410
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:36,169
My brother told me he's
paid you everything he owes,

411
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:38,791
but that you still want more.

412
00:29:38,826 --> 00:29:40,565
Sayid, that's a lie.

413
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:42,310
<i>Your brother does owe me,</i>

414
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:45,502
<i>and somebody is gonna pay me that money.</i>

415
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:47,668
Did you put my brother in the hospital?

416
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:51,551
<i>Oh, you think it was me?</i>

417
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:55,406
I didn't do that.

418
00:29:57,591 --> 00:29:59,823
You know, it's a dangerous world, Sayid.

419
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:01,990
Y-You know that because you're from Iraq.

420
00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:06,948
You never know when somebody's
just gonna sneak up--

421
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

422
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:17,262
Sayid...

423
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:21,068
- Okay, just relax now.
- Shut up.

424
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,656
Okay. Fine.

425
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,155
Fine. Okay, it's done.

426
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:28,563
All right?

427
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:30,880
Y-Your brother doesn't owe me anything.

428
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:32,532
The debt's forgiven, all right?

429
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:38,138
Good? Okay?

430
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:41,901
Just relax and... forget about it.

431
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,737
I can't.

432
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:31,331
Who are you?

433
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:33,105
No English.

434
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,841
You let him talk to you.

435
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,061
I stabbed him in the
chest like you told me to.

436
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:54,711
<i>Then I let him talk to me.</i>

437
00:32:00,873 --> 00:32:03,289
That's twice you've tried
to have someone else kill me.

438
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:07,231
You had the opportunity to do it yourself.

439
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:09,749
Why didn't you?

440
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:19,588
I was a businessman once... in Osaka.

441
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,955
I worked at a bank.

442
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:27,174
I was good at my job,

443
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:28,761
very successful.

444
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:31,351
And one Friday,

445
00:32:31,856 --> 00:32:33,691
I was promoted.

446
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:39,594
My associates took me out to celebrate.

447
00:32:42,986 --> 00:32:45,057
I had too much to drink.

448
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:50,574
Every Friday...

449
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,967
I picked my son up from baseball.

450
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,167
He was 12.

451
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,800
The accident was very bad.

452
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,365
I survived.

453
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,952
But my son...

454
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,638
And then...

455
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,219
In the hospital...

456
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,548
A man came to me...

457
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:31,153
A man I had never met.

458
00:33:32,216 --> 00:33:33,889
And he told me that

459
00:33:34,382 --> 00:33:36,591
he could save my son's life,

460
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:40,272
but I would have to
come here to this island,

461
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,819
where I would have a new job.

462
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,541
And I could never see my boy again.

463
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,752
Who was this man?

464
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:08,110
His name was Jacob.

465
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,860
Jacob drives a hard bargain.

466
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:15,368
The man outside...

467
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,939
I take it he offered
you a similar bargain?

468
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:22,818
Yes.

469
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,818
It is sundown.

470
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:40,680
Will you choose to stay or go?

471
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,003
I'd like to stay.

472
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,303
Oh, my God!

473
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,636
What have you done?!

474
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,904
Do you realize what you just did?!

475
00:35:45,036 --> 00:35:47,070
He was the only thing keeping it out!

476
00:35:48,203 --> 00:35:49,236
Idiot!

477
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:52,504
You just let it in!

478
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:59,303
I know.

479
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,016
We gotta go now.

480
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:33,017
Run, run, run!

481
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,018
This way!

482
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:52,016
- This way! This way!
- I have to go get Claire.

483
00:37:16,882 --> 00:37:19,021
Where are Shephard and Reyes and Ford?

484
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:19,782
Who the hell are you?

485
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:21,249
- Just answer the question.
- They're gone.

486
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,883
Everyone's gone. I'm the only one left.

487
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:25,710
Kate and I got separated. Lapidus?

488
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,858
- How did you... - We'll
play catch-up later.

489
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:28,903
You want to live, you
better move your ass.

490
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,596
What about Jarrah? Is he here?

491
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,026
Yeah, he was headed to the pool room.

492
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:33,057
I'll go get him.

493
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,684
Linus, wait!

494
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:38,916
All right, the rest of
you, with me. Come on.

495
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:44,559
Claire, come on! Claire, we gotta go.

496
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,504
- You gotta get out of there.
- No.

497
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:49,691
- What?!
- You'll be much safer here.
