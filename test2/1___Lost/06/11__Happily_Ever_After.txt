1
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,963
Mr. Hume.

2
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,269
My name is Zoe.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,794
I know you're disoriented.

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,221
You've been unconscious
for the last three days.

5
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:19,890
But you're off the I.V. sedation now.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,579
And I've just given you a
shot to help you wake up.

7
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:28,813
Are you a nurse?

8
00:00:29,713 --> 00:00:31,487
You're not in a hospital
anymore, Mr. Hume.

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,581
We had to move you.

10
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:35,215
What? Move... move me? Move me where?

11
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:36,869
Where's my wife?

12
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:39,607
No. Wait. M... you
shouldn't... you shouldn't...

13
00:00:39,724 --> 00:00:40,900
I wanna see Penny.

14
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,944
I'm afraid that's not
gonna be possible, Desmond.

15
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:49,737
You.

16
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,171
Mr. Hume...

17
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:55,156
Easy. Easy. I'll take it from here.

18
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:56,431
You should sit.

19
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,738
Desmond.

20
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,163
What happened to me? Where am I?

21
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:06,431
You were shot by Benjamin Linus.

22
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,258
Do you remember that?

23
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,325
Yes, I remember.

24
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:12,709
Yeah, I wanna talk to Penny. Penny!

25
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:15,662
She's not here. But I assure you,

26
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:18,188
both she and your son are perfectly safe.

27
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:20,768
I'm really sorry for
taking you away from them,

28
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,495
but I didn't have a
chance to explain, and...

29
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,973
If I had, you never would've come with me.

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,965
Come with you?

31
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:31,896
Come with you where?

32
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,945
I brought you back to the island.

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,064
I... can't imagine how
you must be feeling.

34
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,215
But if you'll give me
a chance to explain...

35
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:52,308
- Damn it! Don't hurt him!
- You take me back!

36
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:56,201
- You take me back right now, you hear!?
- I can't take you back.

37
00:01:57,512 --> 00:01:59,482
The island isn't done with you yet.

38
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,676
Aah!

39
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:08,264
What is Desmond doing here?

40
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,562
It will be easier for me to show
you than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.

41
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:14,321
Take him with you to the generator room.

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,275
I'll be along with Hume
so we can start the test.

43
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:19,362
Charles, that... that... that
test isn't scheduled till tomorrow.

44
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:22,065
I know when it's scheduled.
Get them ready now.

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,630
Come on. No time for sightseeing.

46
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,956
Double-check inside.

47
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,675
They're bringing Hume down now.

48
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:01,308
- What?!
- You heard me. We are go right now.

49
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,303
- What's your time frame?
- We're not even close to being ready.

50
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,427
This generator probably
hasn't run in 20 years.

51
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,059
- How am I supposed to...
- Widmore doesn't want to wait.

52
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,943
- What are you doing here?
- Running a little test.

53
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:10,811
- What kind of test?
- All right, let's see where we are.

54
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,941
Can we get a functioning
E.M. field going, people?

55
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,105
- Sure thing.
- Let's try a power test.

56
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:16,332
Generator to full, please. Okay.

57
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,691
Here we go. On my count...

58
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,043
Three... two... one.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,575
And power on.

60
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,441
Great.

61
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:33,207
We probably got a faulty
contact somewhere. Find it.

62
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,777
Simmons, go down and check
the circuits on the solenoids.

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,335
- Yes, sir.
- Try it again.

64
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:39,364
Guess what, angstrom?

65
00:03:39,481 --> 00:03:40,901
You're going in there next.

66
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:04,664
Found it!

67
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,828
It's a bad breaker on the genny.

68
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,802
- Bringing it back online now.
- No!

69
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:14,595
No!

70
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:17,487
Turn it off! Turn it off!

71
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,298
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,378
Zoe.

73
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,902
- Are we ready?
- Let's go.

74
00:04:48,893 --> 00:04:58,695
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by kuniva</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">addic7ed.com</font>

75
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,226
Stop.

76
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:29,181
You can take him now. Thank you.

77
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,701
Put him inside.

78
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,860
No! Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

79
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,824
- I know how this looks, Desmond.
- Aah!

80
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:47,321
But if everything I've
been told about you is true,

81
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:48,809
you'll be perfectly fine.

82
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,469
You don't have any metal on
you, do you? Keys? Change?

83
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,001
Of course he doesn't, you idiot.

84
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:57,615
I hate to resort to forcing
this upon you, Desmond...

85
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:03,806
But once it's over, I'm going
to ask you to make a sacrifice.

86
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:07,443
And I hope, for all our
sakes, you'll help me.

87
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,730
Sacrifice?

88
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,548
What the bloody hell do
you know about sacrifice?

89
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:21,532
My son died here for
the sake of this island.

90
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,129
Your wife... my own daughter...

91
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:25,242
hates me.

92
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,188
And I've never even met my grandson.

93
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:33,063
But if you won't help me, Desmond,
all of it will be for nothing.

94
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:40,197
Penny, your son and everyone
else will be gone... forever.

95
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:07,846
All right. Turn it on.

96
00:07:07,963 --> 00:07:10,614
No. If you want me to help you
with whatever you're doing here,

97
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,177
- you need to explain to me...
- That man is

98
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:14,613
the only person I'm aware of in the world

99
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,406
who has survived a catastrophic
electromagnetic event.

100
00:07:17,743 --> 00:07:19,884
I need to know that he can do it again,

101
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,723
or we all die.

102
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,155
Turn it on.

103
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:43,047
- Do we have full power?
- Yeah, but...

104
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,867
Let me out!

105
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,093
Let me out of here, you bastards!

106
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:04,754
Let me out!

107
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:06,610
Let me out of here!

108
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,896
Let me out of here!

109
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,096
It's carousel 4.

110
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,007
Sorry?

111
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,253
You were on the Sydney flight, right?

112
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,122
- Yeah.
- Our bags are on carousel 4.

113
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,913
I double-checked it with
the dude at the counter.

114
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,570
Thank you.

115
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,819
Hang on. I've got it. I got it.

116
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,343
Thank you so much.

117
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,904
Pleasure.

118
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,385
Do you have any more bags?

119
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:11,544
No. Uh, that's it, thank God.

120
00:09:11,861 --> 00:09:13,903
- Boy or a girl?
- Um...

121
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,724
- Oh, I'm sorry. I... I... I didn't mean to pry.
- Oh, no, no. It's... it's fine.

122
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:21,745
I just, um... I don't know what it is.

123
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:22,593
Oh, right.

124
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:26,467
Well, you're braver than I.
I'm not a big fan of surprises.

125
00:09:28,614 --> 00:09:30,505
Oh, excuse me. That's mine.

126
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,134
Excuse me.

127
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:42,946
So... have... have you
got someone meeting you?

128
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,421
Uh, yeah. I... I don't
know. Maybe they got the...

129
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:46,885
flights mixed up or something.

130
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,241
Because I've got a car picking me up.

131
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,506
You know, if you need a ride, I'd be
more than happy to give you a lift.

132
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,775
Oh, no, no, no. That's, um,
that's really sweet of you,

133
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:56,752
- but I'm... I'm good. There's cabs, so...
- Oh. Oh, all right. Yeah.

134
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,556
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

135
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,480
A boy.

136
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:03,557
- What?
- I bet it's a boy.

137
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,282
<i>Lockers located at baggage claim entrance.</i>

138
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:11,375
<i>Detailed baggage claim information on...</i>

139
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,647
Looks like I'm with you.

140
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,656
Mr. Hume. Hello. Let me grab that for you.

141
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,595
Thank you.

142
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:26,346
- My name is George.
- Hi, George.

143
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:29,093
So I will take you back to your hotel?

144
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,058
The office.

145
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,664
Office. Wonderful. Um, this way, please.

146
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,841
So, uh, you... you flew
in from Sydney, huh?

147
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,579
Yeah. That's right.

148
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:42,043
And what... what were you doin', uh... .

149
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,227
down under?

150
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:45,853
I was closing a deal for the boss.

151
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,807
Oh. Good for you. Congratulations.

152
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,871
Hey, listen, if you need anything at all

153
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,648
while you're in town, I know everyone.

154
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,950
If you need a reservation,
you just pick a restaurant.

155
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,204
Uh, the room service at the
hotel is excellent. Thank you.

156
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:01,139
You, uh, you looking,
uh, for some company?

157
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,026
Well, I noticed that you
weren't wearing a wedding band,

158
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,948
and there are a lot of lovely ladies

159
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,070
offering their, uh, "companionship."

160
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,379
I'm not looking for any companionship.

161
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,869
I'm here to work.

162
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:17,213
Guess that's why you're the boss's
right-hand man, and I am the driver.

163
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:20,265
Okay. Got it.

164
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:31,284
Good morning, Mr. Hume.
How was your flight?

165
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:32,271
Lovely. Thank you.

166
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,171
- He said to send you right in.
- Thank you.

167
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,331
Charles.

168
00:11:43,643 --> 00:11:45,146
Hello, Desmond.

169
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,834
Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.

170
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:50,708
Thank you.

171
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:03,417
I don't give a bloody damn what he did.

172
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,350
Or how much it's going to cost.

173
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,994
Just get him arraigned
and get him out of there.

174
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,550
Sorry, Desmond.

175
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,847
Looks like our celebration
of the Australian deal

176
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,448
is gonna have to be cut short.

177
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,559
You are aware that my son is a musician?

178
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:20,806
Yes. I've heard he's quite talented.

179
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,793
Yeah, he is, quite.

180
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,906
Anyway, my wife is putting together

181
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,421
one of her charity events,

182
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,124
and, uh, the boy had the crazy idea

183
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,734
to combine classical
music with modern rock.

184
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,717
Have you heard of a
band called drive shaft?

185
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,377
No, can't say I have.

186
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,489
Their bass guitarist overdosed
and, uh, got himself arrested.

187
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:43,452
And now if I don't get this
junkie to my wife's event,

188
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:47,054
she will, simply put, destroy me.

189
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,888
- So you want me to babysit him.
- I know it's beneath you,

190
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,284
but I need someone I can
trust to do the job right.

191
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:53,535
Say no more, Charles. It's done.

192
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,153
You really do have the life, son.

193
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:00,789
No family, no commitments.

194
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:03,112
Ah, to be free of attachments.

195
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:05,883
I'm a blessed man, sir.

196
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:10,143
No, it is I who am blessed
to have you in my employ.

197
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,969
A drink to celebrate
your indispensability.

198
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:18,894
That's your 60-year-old
scotch, Charles.

199
00:13:22,085 --> 00:13:23,470
Nothing's too good for you.

200
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,627
Slainte.

201
00:13:54,402 --> 00:13:56,232
- Mr. Hume?
- That's right.

202
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:58,438
Bail's all been taken care of.

203
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,523
Remember, he's not
allowed to leave the state.

204
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,008
Mr. Pace, I'm Desmond Hume.

205
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:05,747
Charles Widmore sent me...

206
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,928
Hey! Where you going?

207
00:14:09,737 --> 00:14:11,092
He's all yours.

208
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,037
<i>Hey! What's wrong with you?!</i>

209
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,694
Come on.

210
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,823
Yeah, I'll have whatever he's having.

211
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,435
One drink, then we go.

212
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,809
So what's your job then... to babysit me?

213
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,783
What are you? Mr. Widmore's chief lackey?

214
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,451
- Henchman?
- No title.

215
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,270
Plenty of perks, though.

216
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,077
Mm. Such as?

217
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,157
I get to meet charming people.

218
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,830
Well... cheers, then.

219
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,518
Tell me, perky. Are you happy?

220
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,313
Quite.

221
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:15,320
No, you're not.

222
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,394
Well, I've got a great job, lots of money,

223
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,452
travel the world. Why wouldn't I be happy?

224
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:24,456
- Have you ever been in love?
- Dozens of times.

225
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,919
That's not what I'm talking about.

226
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:31,006
I'm talking about spectacular,
consciousness-altering love.

227
00:15:32,003 --> 00:15:33,661
Do you know what that looks like?

228
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:35,900
I wasn't aware that love
looked like anything.

229
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,850
I've seen it, mate... on
the plane back from Sydney.

230
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,575
Is that so?

231
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,150
Well, we were on the same flight, so...

232
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:46,095
Maybe I saw it, too.

233
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,346
Trust me. You didn't.

234
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,250
No? Enlighten me.

235
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:54,979
There was this woman

236
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:58,536
two rows in front of me... in handcuffs...

237
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,303
sittin' with a cop.

238
00:16:01,735 --> 00:16:04,801
He looked at me, knew I was holding.

239
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,374
If I didn't take action, I'd be caught.

240
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:09,783
So I got up, went to the lav...

241
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:14,420
Proceeded to eliminate the
evidence by swallowing my stash.

242
00:16:15,338 --> 00:16:20,139
And at that exact
moment, we hit turbulence.

243
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,120
I choked.

244
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:28,702
The entire bag of heroin
is stuck in my throat.

245
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:32,435
It's, uh, it's over.
Everything starts to go dark.

246
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,943
I'm slippin' into the abyss, and then...

247
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,231
I see... her.

248
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,696
"Her"?

249
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:42,870
A woman.

250
00:16:43,184 --> 00:16:44,322
Blonde.

251
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:46,679
Rapturously beautiful.

252
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,674
And I know her.

253
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,803
We're together.

254
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,561
It's like...

255
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:54,646
We've always been, and...

256
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,854
always will be.

257
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:58,720
This...

258
00:17:00,223 --> 00:17:01,844
feeling, this...

259
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,071
love.

260
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,742
And just as I'm about
to be engulfed by it...

261
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,910
I open my eyes, and this sodding idiot

262
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,342
is standing there, asking me if I'm okay.

263
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,137
But I saw it.

264
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,930
Just for a moment, I
saw what it looked like.

265
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:27,924
Well, that's just...

266
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,649
poetry, brother.

267
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,256
You know, you should... you
should write a song about that.

268
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're saying.

269
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:37,739
"Poor suicidal rock star."

270
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:41,850
But I've seen something
real. I've seen the truth.

271
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,933
No, that's not the truth.

272
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,636
You wanna know the real truth, Pace?

273
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,525
Right now you have a choice.

274
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,729
You can keep on drinkin',
or you can come with me.

275
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,312
Now before you make your choice,
realize that if you stay here,

276
00:17:55,838 --> 00:18:00,311
it will very likely result in the
extermination of your musical career.

277
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,636
And if I go with you?

278
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,944
In 20 minutes, you'll be luxuriating in a
five-star hotel, right on the harbor front.

279
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,055
Charles Widmore, one of the
most powerful men in this town,

280
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,068
will owe you a favor.

281
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:17,023
Doesn't really seem like a choice.

282
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,053
There's always a choice, brother.

283
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,175
That's my band.

284
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,935
Drive Shaft.

285
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,016
Our first single.

286
00:18:38,627 --> 00:18:41,208
The beginning of everything great.

287
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:49,193
You like it?

288
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:52,267
Sure. For what it is.

289
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:55,883
I feel sorry for you, mate.

290
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,014
You think you're happy.
You think you got it all.

291
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:02,744
This... your life.

292
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,467
But you don't.

293
00:19:05,996 --> 00:19:07,815
Hmm. Why, because none of it's real?

294
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,903
All right, Mr. Hume. How
about I offer you a choice?

295
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,215
What's that?

296
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,155
I can either show you
what I'm talking about,

297
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,378
or you can get out of the car.

298
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:23,886
Why in God's name would
I want to get out of...

299
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,923
Charlie! Charlie!

300
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,138
Come on!

301
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:06,597
Come on!

302
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,171
Come on!

303
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:15,259
Come on, damn it!

304
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:28,147
You sustained a pretty
bad bump in your accident.

305
00:21:28,264 --> 00:21:29,379
Any nausea?

306
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:30,726
Nope.

307
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:31,850
- Double vision?
- No.

308
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:34,397
Listen, I need to find the man
that I was brought in here with.

309
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:35,868
How about hallucinations?

310
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,119
What do you mean?

311
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:43,688
Hallucinations. Seeing
things that aren't there.

312
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,403
I'm not sure.

313
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,705
Well, your C.A.T. scan was inconclusive.

314
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:56,177
I'm gonna send you
downstairs for an M.R.I.

315
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:57,950
No, I don't have time for this.

316
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,965
I need to find the man
I came in here with.

317
00:21:59,966 --> 00:22:01,314
I'm afraid you're not finding anyone

318
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,886
till we know what's going
on inside your brain.

319
00:22:05,472 --> 00:22:08,236
Are you wearing any metal,
carrying keys or change?

320
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:11,029
Any metal inside your body...
pacemakers, pins, bullets?

321
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:13,418
- Steel plate inside of your head?
- No, nothing.

322
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:15,993
I see you didn't list
an emergency contact.

323
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:17,685
No friends or family?

324
00:22:19,063 --> 00:22:21,316
Just put down my
employer... Charles Widmore.

325
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,833
This machine is super loud.

326
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,475
You're gonna want these.

327
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:33,779
And you need the button.

328
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,008
- Button?
- Panic button.

329
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:38,845
You need to stop, press
it. But try not to,

330
00:22:38,962 --> 00:22:40,957
'cause we'll have to start all
over again from the beginning.

331
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:42,734
I'll be in that booth over
there. You'll be able to hear me.

332
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:44,635
30 minutes, okay?

333
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,688
Okay, here we go.

334
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,041
<i>Desmond?</i>

335
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:40,818
Hey, let me out of here!

336
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:46,869
What happened, man? Are you all right?

337
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,068
I need to find the man
I came in here with.

338
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,535
I need to find the man
I came in here with.

339
00:23:54,044 --> 00:23:56,463
His name is Charlie Pace.
He came in an hour ago.

340
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,633
If you'd just give me his room number...

341
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,198
If you're not a relative,
that's confidential information.

342
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:03,252
Look, we were in an accident
together. I need to see him.

343
00:24:03,253 --> 00:24:04,945
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

344
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,588
E... excuse me.

345
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,636
Um... we were on the same Oceanic flight.

346
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:14,058
Um, from Sydney.

347
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:16,525
Yeah, yeah. You were, uh,
you were sitting next to me.

348
00:24:17,905 --> 00:24:19,639
- Desmond, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

349
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,223
Listen, I... I wonder if
you can help me, brother.

350
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,348
I need to find someone.
He was on our plane.

351
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:26,235
- He's somewhere in the hospital.
- Wait. He was on our plane,

352
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:27,922
and now he's here in the hospital?

353
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,433
None of this matters!
None of this matters!

354
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,630
No! Sir, please! Stop!

355
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:32,321
Take it easy.

356
00:24:59,387 --> 00:25:01,252
Why you running? 'Cause
no one here can help me.

357
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,603
Now let me go.

358
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,811
- Why'd you try and kill me?
- I didn't try and kill you.

359
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,164
I was trying to show you something.

360
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:08,601
You wanna show me
something? Show me your hand.

361
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,235
- What?
- Your hand. Show me your bloody hands now.

362
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,448
You saw something, didn't you?

363
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,287
In the water.

364
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:17,500
What was it?

365
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:20,005
What are you looking for, mate?

366
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:23,728
Who's Penny?

367
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:25,545
I don't know.

368
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:32,232
- You felt it, didn't you?
- I didn't feel anything.

369
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:34,720
Then why are you accosting
a man in a dressing gown?

370
00:25:35,013 --> 00:25:36,114
All right, come on. We're leaving.

371
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,759
Whoa! You think I'm gonna go
play a rock concert after this?

372
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:41,741
This doesn't matter.

373
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:43,798
None of this matters.

374
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,989
All that matters is that we felt it.

375
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:50,648
You wanna try and stop me? Good luck.

376
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:53,560
Hey. Where you going?

377
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:57,217
If I were you, I'd stop worrying about me

378
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,569
and start looking for Penny.

379
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:13,668
What do you mean, he's gone?

380
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:14,716
Look, he escaped.

381
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:16,511
He knocked over a doctor
with a bloody crash cart

382
00:26:16,512 --> 00:26:18,704
and then ran out of
hospital. And you let him go?

383
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:21,669
He's a junkie who drove my
car into the ocean, Charles.

384
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,379
<i>I'm fine, by the way. Thanks for asking.</i>

385
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:26,446
And I'm thrilled you survived, Desmond.

386
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:29,119
But when I give you a job
to do, I expect you to do it.

387
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,238
With all due respect, sir,
it's just a bloody concert.

388
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,155
I'll tell you what, Desmond.

389
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:35,169
If you can't deliver Pace,

390
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,983
why don't you tell Mrs. Widmore
it's only a bloody concert?

391
00:26:52,473 --> 00:26:53,600
Mr. Hume.

392
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:02,721
So you've never met the boss's wife, huh?

393
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:05,281
No.

394
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,475
Good luck.

395
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,057
Please tell me

396
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,827
how it is that someone
in your line of work

397
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:20,209
is not aware that the butter knife
is placed handle to the right?

398
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,038
Blade facing left just so.

399
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:25,970
For God sake.

400
00:27:31,412 --> 00:27:32,985
- Mrs. Widmore?
- Yes?

401
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:36,611
My name is Desmond Hume.
I work for your husband.

402
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:39,556
Oh, of course, Mr. Hume.

403
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,631
Charles has told me so much about you.

404
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:44,684
It's a travesty we haven't met before.

405
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:46,908
Well, it's about time.

406
00:27:47,262 --> 00:27:48,800
Well, the feeling is mutual, Mrs. Widmore.

407
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:51,534
Oh, please. It's Eloise.

408
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:52,951
Eloise.

409
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:56,954
So, uh, what crisis forced Charles

410
00:27:56,988 --> 00:28:01,623
to send his best fix-it man
into the bowels of charity balls?

411
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,817
Well, Eloise, um...

412
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,643
I'm deeply sorry, but it
appears as if, uh, drive shaft

413
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:10,897
won't be able to perform
alongside your son.

414
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:14,221
And, um, I take full responsibility...

415
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,141
Don't worry about it.

416
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:20,025
Excuse me?

417
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:21,894
Oh, my son will understand.

418
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:25,611
I suppose if one employs
so-called rock stars,

419
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:29,884
a certain unpredictability
comes with the territory.

420
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,745
Yeah. Y... you're not angry?

421
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,972
Oh, not at all, dear.

422
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,497
What happened, happened.

423
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,166
Thank you so much, Mr. Hume,

424
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,349
for coming and telling me in person.

425
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,624
A pleasure meeting you. And you.

426
00:28:46,883 --> 00:28:49,460
Uh, center that flower
arrangement, please.

427
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,680
Have a good evening.

428
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,469
Thank you.

429
00:28:52,996 --> 00:28:55,519
Leifer, Stephanie... Plus two.

430
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:57,473
Markey, Mary... plus one.

431
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,665
Milton, Penny... solo.

432
00:29:00,273 --> 00:29:02,913
- Pepper, Nicholas... plus one.
- Excuse me.

433
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,157
I'm sorry. Um...

434
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:07,353
Did you just say "Penny"?

435
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:09,929
And who are you? Um,
I work for Mr. Widmore.

436
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:10,651
May I see the list?

437
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,844
You absolutely may not.

438
00:29:12,915 --> 00:29:14,769
That list is confidential.

439
00:29:15,097 --> 00:29:16,130
Begging your pardon,

440
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,241
I... I'm entrusted with
confidential items every day...

441
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:20,062
Are you questioning me?

442
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,294
No, I... just want to look
at one name on that list.

443
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,631
And if, for some reason,
that's a problem...

444
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:26,959
Come with me.

445
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,158
Out, everyone. Now.

446
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,242
Look, I'm...

447
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:40,819
I'm sorry if I've overstepped
my bounds, but I just...

448
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:42,726
Stop talking, Hume.

449
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,537
I've heard what you've had
to say. Now you listen to me.

450
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,758
I want you to stop.

451
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,704
Stop? S... stop what?

452
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:55,004
Someone has clearly affected
the way you see things.

453
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,767
This is a serious problem.

454
00:29:56,884 --> 00:29:59,513
It is, in fact, a violation.

455
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:01,179
So whatever you're doing,

456
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:04,073
whatever it is you think
you're looking for...

457
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,957
You need to stop looking for it.

458
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:11,790
Do you...

459
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:15,442
do you know what I'm
looking for, Mrs. Widmore?

460
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,553
I don't know why you're
looking for anything.

461
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:19,181
You have the perfect life.

462
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,224
On top of it, you've managed to attain

463
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,945
the thing you wanted more than anything...

464
00:30:24,062 --> 00:30:26,029
my husband's approval.

465
00:30:27,237 --> 00:30:29,667
How do you know what I want?

466
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,590
Because I bloody do.

467
00:30:33,342 --> 00:30:35,477
I need to see that list...

468
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,930
or you need to tell me why I can't.

469
00:30:38,048 --> 00:30:42,568
You can't because you're
not ready yet, Desmond.

470
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,229
Ready? Ready? R... ready for what?

471
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:02,093
That bad, huh?

472
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:07,057
Is there any alcohol in this car?

473
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,263
Oh, yeah.

474
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:11,314
Whatever you need.

475
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,177
So, uh...

476
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:16,167
where to, Mr. Hume?

477
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:20,531
Just drive, George.

478
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,660
- Mr. Hume.
- Yes?

479
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:31,206
My name is Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

480
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:34,810
We need to talk.

481
00:31:38,618 --> 00:31:40,296
Look, uh, Mr. Widmore, um...

482
00:31:40,329 --> 00:31:42,315
Dan. Please, call me Dan.

483
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:43,889
"Mr. Widmore" is my father.

484
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:46,400
Dan, um, look, if... if
this is about Charlie Pace

485
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:50,163
not being able to perform with
you, I'm... I'm very sorry.

486
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:52,879
Do you believe in love
at first sight, Mr. Hume?

487
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,327
Excuse me?

488
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:03,208
The first time I saw her, I was walking
through this museum a few weeks ago.

489
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:06,530
She... she works here.
She was on her lunch break.

490
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,921
She was eating a chocolate bar.

491
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,534
She has these incredible
blue, blue eyes, red hair.

492
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,685
And as soon as I saw her,

493
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:18,665
right... right in that
moment, it was like...

494
00:32:20,808 --> 00:32:22,988
it was like I already loved her.

495
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,533
And that's when things got weird.

496
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,505
That same night after I saw that woman...

497
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:36,627
I woke up and I wrote this.

498
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,270
So what is it?

499
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:47,869
I'm a musician. I have no idea.

500
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:49,873
So I took it to a friend
of mine at Caltech.

501
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,839
He's a math whiz. He said
this is quantum mechanics.

502
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,935
He said these equations
are so advanced that

503
00:32:57,052 --> 00:33:00,057
only someone who'd been studying
physics their entire life

504
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:01,352
could've come up with them.

505
00:33:02,223 --> 00:33:03,468
So...

506
00:33:04,723 --> 00:33:05,813
so what do they mean?

507
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,227
Okay, imagine... imagine something
terrible is about to happen,

508
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,154
something catastrophic.

509
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:15,257
And the only way to stop
it from happening was by...

510
00:33:15,374 --> 00:33:17,780
releasing a huge amount of energy.

511
00:33:18,512 --> 00:33:20,694
Like setting off a nuclear bomb.

512
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:25,705
- You wanna set off a nuclear bomb?
- Just listen.

513
00:33:26,761 --> 00:33:29,522
What if this... all this...

514
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,402
what if this wasn't
supposed to be our life?

515
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,792
What if we... we had some other life

516
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:41,567
and for some reason, we changed things?

517
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,511
I don't want to set off
a nuclear bomb, Mr. Hume.

518
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:53,182
I think I already did.

519
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:00,631
Listen, mate, um...

520
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:03,693
I don't know what any of
this has to do with me. So...

521
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,111
Why did you ask my mother
about a woman named Penny?

522
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,722
It happened to you, too, didn't it?

523
00:34:16,036 --> 00:34:17,409
You felt it.

524
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:19,186
I don't know...

525
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:25,764
I don't know what I felt.

526
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,806
Yes, you do.

527
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,333
You felt love.

528
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:36,116
That's impossible because I don't
know anything about this woman.

529
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:39,450
I don't know...
I don't know where she is.

530
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:41,539
I don't even know if she exists.

531
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:43,512
She's...

532
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,513
she's an idea.

533
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,269
No, Mr. Hume.

534
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:56,650
She's my half-sister.

535
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:04,501
And I can tell you exactly
where and when you can find her.

536
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,911
Excuse me?

537
00:35:58,751 --> 00:35:59,956
Yeah?

538
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:03,961
Are you Penny?

539
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:07,576
Uh, yes.

540
00:36:09,806 --> 00:36:10,839
Hello.

541
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:14,365
I'm Desmond.

542
00:36:18,724 --> 00:36:19,924
Uh, hi.

543
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:26,661
<i>Checking in now.</i>

544
00:36:35,914 --> 00:36:36,869
He's okay.

545
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,832
Indeed he is.

546
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,402
How are you, Desmond? How are you feeling?

547
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,527
Fine.

548
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:53,502
H-how long was I unconscious for?

549
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,583
Oh, no more than a few seconds.

550
00:36:59,454 --> 00:37:01,033
Will you help me up, please?

551
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,547
I'm really sorry we had
to do this to you, Desmond.

552
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:11,844
But as I told you, your...
talent is vital to our mission.

553
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,023
- So if you just let me explain...
- It's all right.

554
00:37:15,009 --> 00:37:15,766
I understand.

555
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:19,050
What?

556
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:21,392
I said I understand.

557
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:24,730
You told me you brought
me here to the island

558
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:25,933
to do something very important.

559
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,547
Yeah.

560
00:37:28,907 --> 00:37:30,281
When do we start?

561
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:43,834
What happened to you?

562
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:46,019
What do you mean?

563
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:48,359
What I mean is 20 minutes ago,

564
00:37:48,405 --> 00:37:51,248
you were beating the crap out
of Widmore with an I.V. stand,

565
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:53,827
and... and now you're Mr. Cooperative.

566
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:57,266
A lot can happen in 20 minutes.

567
00:37:57,934 --> 00:37:59,341
Sure it can.

568
00:37:59,595 --> 00:38:01,549
That thing fried your brain.

569
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:05,228
Did it?

570
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:07,997
Whatever. Doesn't change
that you're gonna...

571
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:14,217
Run.

572
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,616
Desmond, I don't have time to explain,

573
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:22,722
but these people are extremely dangerous.

574
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:25,063
We need to go now.

575
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:28,139
Aye, of course.

576
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,118
Lead the way.

577
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,218
Hello? You okay?

578
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:46,132
What happened?

579
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,638
Well, I shook your hand,
and then you fainted.

580
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,498
I must have quite an effect on you.

581
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,427
Aye.

582
00:38:55,161 --> 00:38:56,734
Aye, you must have.

583
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,134
Have we met before?

584
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:04,466
I... I think we'd remember it if we had.

585
00:39:04,499 --> 00:39:05,979
Yeah.

586
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,885
Well, as long as you're
sure you're all right...

587
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:09,994
Yeah, I'm fine.

588
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,036
Hey, listen. Um...

589
00:39:13,116 --> 00:39:14,536
Would you like to go for a coffee?

590
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,841
What, now?

591
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:20,458
I'm a sweaty mess.

592
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:23,345
I just fainted in front of you.

593
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,829
I'd say we're even.

594
00:39:29,763 --> 00:39:32,521
There's a coffee shop on the
corner of Sweetzer and Melrose.

595
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:35,262
I'll meet you there in an hour.

596
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:38,692
Absolutely.

597
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,115
Okay. Okay.

598
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,053
So? Did you find what you're looking for?

599
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:24,535
Yes, George. I did.

600
00:40:28,837 --> 00:40:30,293
Call on Melrose and Sweetzer, please.

601
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:31,448
You got it.

602
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:36,018
And if there's anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Hume, you just name it.

603
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:42,251
Actually, there is one thing, George.

604
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,133
Can you get me the manifest
of my flight from Sydney?

605
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,046
Oceanic 815.

606
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,158
Just the names of the passengers.

607
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:53,701
Sure, I can.

608
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,567
Do you mind if I ask
you what you need it for?

609
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,323
I just need to show them something.

610
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:09,507
