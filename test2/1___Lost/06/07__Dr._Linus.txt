1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,343
Previously on lost...

2
00:00:07,096 --> 00:00:08,987
These are our names. Where's Jacob?

3
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:09,574
I don't know.

4
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:11,382
Why is my name written down on this thing?

5
00:00:11,382 --> 00:00:13,314
He didn't tell me. What
does he want from me?

6
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:14,391
I had to get you and Jake

7
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:17,059
- as far away from that temple as I possibly could.
- What? Why?

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,461
'Cause someone's coming there.

9
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:20,929
Someone bad.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,898
Take cover!

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,033
Aah!

12
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:28,902
- There's still time.
- Not for me.

13
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,144
Whoa! Oh!

14
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:04,583
Where's Jarrah?

15
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:06,634
I'm fine. Thank you.

16
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,728
- Where is he?!
- Considering that he just killed Dogen,

17
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,080
- I don't think he's gonna be joining us.
- Who's Dogen?

18
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,708
The guy in charge of the temple.

19
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,438
Sayid killed the interpreter, too.

20
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,721
- Are you sure?
- He was standing over their dead bodies

21
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:18,946
holding a bloody dagger,
so, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

22
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:20,517
You said we were safe at the temple.

23
00:01:20,518 --> 00:01:22,526
- That's what I was told.
- Well, what about the beach?

24
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:25,519
- What beach?
- Where we buried Locke, where they lived.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,871
At least we'll have the water at our
backs, and it's familiar territory.

26
00:01:27,872 --> 00:01:30,050
Anybody else got a better idea?

27
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:32,629
No. The beach it is. That way.

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,480
Move.

29
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:39,438
And it was on this island
that everything changed,

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,126
that everything finally became clear...

31
00:01:43,127 --> 00:01:45,003
Elba...

32
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,515
Is where Napoleon faced his greatest task.

33
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:51,258
Because exile wasn't
the worst of his fate.

34
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:55,409
What was truly devastating to
him was the loss of his power.

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,589
Sure, they allowed him to
keep the title of emperor.

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,136
But without any power, it was meaningless.

37
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:05,050
He might just as well have been dead.

38
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:08,531
All right, remember, five
and six tomorrow. Thank you.

39
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:12,314
Principal Reynolds. Good morning.

40
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,489
Walk with me.

41
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,638
Linus, there's been a
slight schedule shift.

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,779
I'm going to need you
to supervise detention

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,754
- after school today.
- What?

44
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:24,228
In fact, all week.

45
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,403
Cutbacks, budget crises,
events above your pay grade.

46
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:27,766
Needless to say, some of us have

47
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,981
- to pull double duty.
- But we have History Club today.

48
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,058
Those kids need me... there

49
00:02:31,059 --> 00:02:32,757
are five students in History Club, Linus.

50
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:35,768
- They'll live.
- Shouldn't we be encouraging the ones with ambition?

51
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,709
Spare me. The club isn't
for them. It's for you.

52
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,152
It makes you feel needed.

53
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,092
Unfortunately for now,
you're needed in detention.

54
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,199
Thanks for your understanding, Linus.

55
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:49,116
It's Dr. Linus, actually.

56
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:53,896
Oh, for the love of... it's ruined!

57
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:57,342
It's ruined! Ohh!

58
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,582
Oh, formaldehyde. For...
formaldehyde's the problem.

59
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,324
You know what gets out
formaldehyde? Nothin'.

60
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,330
Maybe if I had some frickin' lab aprons,

61
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,336
I wouldn't have to pay for
our incompetent students

62
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:08,676
with another trip to marshalls.

63
00:03:08,677 --> 00:03:10,882
- Budget cutbacks.
- How hard would it be for Reynolds

64
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:13,357
to spread around a little
of the love to the sciences?

65
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,165
You know. I'm dealing with lab
equipment in there from the 1950s.

66
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,611
Now why is that?

67
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:19,374
Principal Reynolds is an administrator.

68
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,313
He's not a teacher. He's forgotten what

69
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,652
the public school system is about.

70
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,193
Yeah, summers off in
exchange for a crap pension.

71
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:27,830
I'm happy to remind him.

72
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:31,038
No, taking care of the kids.
That's what's important.

73
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,579
Okay. You just keep dreamin'.

74
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,420
Oh, I know you've given
up, but... I refuse to.

75
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:38,959
Maybe you should be the principal.

76
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:44,241
So says the substitute.

77
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:47,047
What do you mean, I
should be the principal?

78
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,119
It just sounds like you
care about this place.

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,860
And if the man in charge doesn't,

80
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:53,932
then maybe it's time for a change.

81
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,508
I appreciate the sentiment,
but who's gonna listen to me?

82
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,752
I'm listenin'.

83
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:17,992
How about you tell me what
that thing back there was?

84
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,786
That thing's what killed her
friends back at the statue.

85
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:22,669
And Jacob, right?

86
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,903
It killed Jacob, too.

87
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:26,870
Yeah, of course. And Jacob.

88
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:28,571
Of course.

89
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:30,338
You're miles, right?

90
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,672
Miles Straume?

91
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,607
You communicate with the dead.

92
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,641
Not technically. I...

93
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,610
I can tell you how someone died,

94
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,278
pick up their last thoughts
before they check out,

95
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,312
but I need to be near their bodies.

96
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:44,614
This is what's left of Jacob's body.

97
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:50,986
So tell me, Miles, how did he die?

98
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,142
Linus killed him.

99
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,877
What?

100
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,512
That's not true.

101
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:34,449
Are you sure?

102
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,936
Well, he was standing
over Jacob's dead body

103
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:39,953
with a bloody dagger,
so... yeah, I'm pretty sure.

104
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:50,231
Thank you.

105
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:57,104
Jacob was the closest thing
I ever had to a father.

106
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,242
Uh-oh.

107
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:57,314
I'm gonna look for some tools

108
00:06:57,314 --> 00:06:59,281
and get to work on some shelter.

109
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:03,271
The rest of you, see what food's
left, maybe get a fire going.

110
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,664
Yeah, a fire'll fix everything.

111
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:14,569
Is there anything you'd like me to do?

112
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,979
You know, psychics... totally unreliable.

113
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,083
Miles actually tried to
blackmail me once into...

114
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,395
You make friends easy, don't ya?

115
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,387
Ah. Ah.

116
00:07:54,388 --> 00:07:56,455
And on top of that,
they'll have to convert

117
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,024
on a 2-point conversion
to make it a tie game.

118
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,059
I made you one of the Turkey meals

119
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,927
with the cranberry sauce that you like.

120
00:08:02,928 --> 00:08:05,996
It ain't one of them "lean" deals, is it?

121
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,665
No. Dad. It's organic.

122
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,600
I'm trying to keep you healthy.

123
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:13,269
Well, it's a little too late for that.

124
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,871
How was work?

125
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,508
I have a doctorate in
modern European history...

126
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,346
And yet I'm babysitting
burnouts in detention.

127
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:28,683
Detention, huh?

128
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,652
And the worst of it is,

129
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:33,821
as I look out at those ingrates

130
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:36,857
that I'm tasked with watching...

131
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,760
I can't help thinking...

132
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:48,566
That maybe I'm more a
loser than any of them.

133
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:55,471
This isn't the life I wanted for you, Ben.

134
00:08:55,472 --> 00:08:57,439
I wanted so much more.

135
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,274
I know.

136
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:03,077
That's why I signed up for
that damn Dharma Initiative

137
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,546
and took you to the island, and...

138
00:09:05,547 --> 00:09:07,714
They were decent people...

139
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:11,352
smarter than I'll ever be.

140
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:14,287
Imagine how different
our lives would've been

141
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:15,889
if we'd stayed.

142
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,091
Yes, we'd have both
lived happily ever after.

143
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,959
No, I'm serious, Ben.

144
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,662
Who knows what you would've become.

145
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
Now does that feel better?

146
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,535
Yes.

147
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,770
Thank you.

148
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,708
Alex?

149
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,542
Dr. Linus.

150
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:44,478
Where were you today? We
had to cancel History Club.

151
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,213
Oh, I'm so sorry.

152
00:09:46,214 --> 00:09:48,415
I should've put a note on the door.

153
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,416
The club meetings have to be postponed.

154
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,384
I'm in detention all week.

155
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:54,586
Oh, yeah? What'd you do?

156
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:57,521
Principal Reynolds
needs me to cover, so...

157
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,356
A.P. test this Friday.

158
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:03,392
I was... kinda counting on the tutoring.

159
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,761
All right, how about this?

160
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:10,563
Tomorrow morning, 7:00
a.m. in the library.

161
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,565
And you bring the coffee.

162
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:14,334
Thanks.

163
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,268
God, you're the best, Dr. Linus.

164
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,204
- My pleasure, Alex.
- Okay.

165
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:20,472
See you.

166
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,554
Excuse me. How long are
we going to stay here?

167
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,922
I told you. I don't know yet.

168
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,522
I need to find my husband.

169
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,057
Trust me, if anyone wants
to find him, it's me.

170
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:48,993
But I don't know where to look.

171
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:51,362
Why do you want to find Jin?

172
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:54,197
Because your last name is Kwon.

173
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:56,032
So is his.

174
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,934
And I don't know whether

175
00:10:57,935 --> 00:11:00,503
I'm supposed to protect
you, him or both of you.

176
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,471
Protect us? What are you talking about?

177
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:06,341
You're candidates...

178
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,976
To replace Jacob.

179
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,111
Replace him?

180
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,246
To do what?

181
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:16,183
If you're the one selected,
I imagine you'll find out.

182
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,787
Wait. You said candidates.

183
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:23,255
How many are there?

184
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,423
Six.

185
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,858
There are only six left.

186
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Cheese curds.

187
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,301
Hurley.

188
00:11:37,302 --> 00:11:39,403
Come on. Wake up.

189
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:45,475
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:11:45,476 --> 00:11:48,111
We can make the temple by nightfall.

191
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:51,047
I'm hungry. Let's... eat breakfast first.

192
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:53,882
No, we can eat on the way.

193
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:55,350
What's the rush?

194
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:57,719
You know, maybe we should take our time?

195
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,619
Why?

196
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,386
Because.

197
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,054
I'm leaving, Hurley. You coming or not?

198
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,597
Unh-unh, dude.

199
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,566
It's this way.

200
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,468
No, we came this way.

201
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:21,006
Yeah, but that was a
mistake. This is faster.

202
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:24,075
Trust me, it's just around
here. It's a shortcut.

203
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,811
No, it's not. You're both wrong.

204
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,681
Temple's that way.

205
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,818
Where did you come from?

206
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:38,318
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

207
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,450
- Try me.
- Not yet.

208
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:43,986
If you wanna go to the
temple, it's this way.

209
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,956
Dude, you trust that guy?

210
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:52,694
At least he's not stalling.

211
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:03,437
When you're finished in the library,

212
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:06,040
give me a hand gettin' some more firewood.

213
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,075
Just looking for something useful.

214
00:13:10,012 --> 00:13:11,445
God.

215
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:14,414
The things people will bring on a trip...

216
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,618
"Oceanic."

217
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,187
I remember that plane breaking in half

218
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:23,855
like it was yesterday.

219
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:26,722
You sound nostalgic.

220
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,322
Maybe I am.

221
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,691
You know, I was supposed to be flying it.

222
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,492
Oceanic 815.

223
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,061
And why didn't you?

224
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:36,996
I overslept.

225
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:39,098
- Come on.
- Can you believe it?

226
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:41,066
Imagine how different my life would be

227
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,934
had that alarm gone off.

228
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:46,871
How different would it have been?

229
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:49,740
The island still got you
in the end, didn't it?

230
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:55,979
Walk.

231
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,197
Okay, wait.

232
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,433
You don't have to do this if... stop.

233
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:22,469
On the ground. Face down.

234
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:39,952
What are you doing?

235
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,823
Look, if this is about at miles said...

236
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:45,058
- Pick it up.
- What?

237
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,260
Pick it up and start digging.

238
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:50,930
Dig what?

239
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,731
A grave.

240
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:54,233
For who?

241
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,468
You murdered Jacob.

242
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,537
It's for you.

243
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,220
Now you know this. I know you do.

244
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,658
Expanded Lord Cornwallis'
powers as governor-general.

245
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,192
Very good.

246
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:14,628
Now moving on to the charter act of 1813.

247
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,496
At the time of the charter,

248
00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:18,563
the east India trading company's power

249
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:22,366
extended to all of India except for...

250
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,966
Uh...

251
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,631
I don't know!

252
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:29,264
It's okay. It's okay. It's just a test.

253
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,731
Just a test?

254
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:33,099
It's only my entire life, Dr. Linus.

255
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,001
- Alex, I think you're being a bit overdramatic.
- Am I?

256
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:39,137
My mom works two jobs
just to pay our rent.

257
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,141
How am I gonna pay for
college, let alone Yale?

258
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,009
Assuming I can even get in.

259
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,247
You're one of the brightest
students I've ever had.

260
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,682
I don't worry about your future at all.

261
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,116
Really?

262
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:55,552
Really. Now what can I do to help?

263
00:15:55,553 --> 00:15:58,254
I'll write you a great letter
of recommendation. I'll...

264
00:15:58,255 --> 00:16:01,824
No, I need someone who went there.

265
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:03,792
Unfortunately, the only one I know

266
00:16:03,793 --> 00:16:05,827
is that pervert, Principal Reynolds.

267
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,962
Excuse me? "Pervert"?

268
00:16:09,731 --> 00:16:12,098
Forget I said that.

269
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:13,533
I was just angry.

270
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:16,602
Alex, has Principal Reynolds...

271
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,270
done something to you?

272
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:19,737
What?

273
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:20,805
Ew!

274
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:23,073
No, I swear. It's not that.

275
00:16:23,074 --> 00:16:25,741
Then what is it?

276
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,643
Dr. Linus, if I tell you,

277
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:30,112
will you promise to keep it between us?

278
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:32,314
Of course I promise.

279
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,717
Okay.

280
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,258
So I was in the nurse's
office a few months ago.

281
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:46,692
I had a stomachache,

282
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:50,196
and I just went in to find
a cot and I fell asleep.

283
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,131
When I woke up after school,

284
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,766
in the other room,
principal Reynolds was there.

285
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:58,136
And the nurse... well, I guess
she forgot I was in there.

286
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:01,004
They were...

287
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:04,107
you know, doing it

288
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:07,242
in the room right next to me,

289
00:17:07,243 --> 00:17:09,844
where they give kids hearing tests.

290
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:13,080
- Isn't that totally gross?
- Totally.

291
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:18,551
Dr. Linus, you're not gonna
say something, are you?

292
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:22,322
No, no. A promise is a promise.

293
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:24,290
Well, shall we return to the high seas?

294
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,524
Yeah.

295
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,192
Sure.

296
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:59,318
Not exactly tearing up on
the digging front, are you?

297
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm not in a big hurry.

298
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:04,255
Brought you some grub.

299
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,257
Hope you like green beans and banana,

300
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,191
'cause it's all we got.

301
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,959
I'm not really hungry.

302
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:13,962
Suit yourself.

303
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:17,632
Miles, do you remember once
you asked me for $3.2 million?

304
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,667
Do you still want it?

305
00:18:19,668 --> 00:18:21,668
What are you gonna do?

306
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:23,670
You're gonna write me a
check on this banana leaf?

307
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,072
I can get off this island, and when I do,

308
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:28,241
I have a vast network
of people and resources

309
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:30,109
that will get you.

310
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,078
All you have to do is cut me loose.

311
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,880
Why would I need your money when there are

312
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,615
a couple of jabonies under
there named Nikki and Paulo

313
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,516
who got buried alive

314
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,485
with $8 million in
diamonds on top of them?

315
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,353
I can't believe you're just gonna stand by

316
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:44,888
and watch this happen.

317
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:47,656
Ilana's gonna murder
me for killing Jacob...

318
00:18:47,657 --> 00:18:50,524
a man who didn't even
care about being killed.

319
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,425
No, he cared.

320
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:54,794
Excuse me? Right up until

321
00:18:54,795 --> 00:18:57,095
the second the knife
went through his heart,

322
00:18:57,096 --> 00:18:58,997
he was hoping he was wrong about you.

323
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,933
I guess he wasn't.

324
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:10,038
Dig!

325
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,619
So... you're not time traveling?

326
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,955
No.

327
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,062
But you look the same
as you did 30 years ago.

328
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:31,033
- How is that possible?
- Not easy to explain.

329
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:33,001
Is this like a "terminator" thing?

330
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,436
You a cyborg?

331
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,404
No, I'm not a cyborg.

332
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:39,040
- Vampire?
- Jacob gave me a gift.

333
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:42,209
Jacob. What do you know about him?

334
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,911
I know he's dead.

335
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:57,056
I thought you said we were
going to the temple, dude.

336
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:58,291
I lied.

337
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:01,258
Why? Because everyone
at the temple is dead.

338
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,495
What do you mean, they're all dead?

339
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:09,829
What happened?

340
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,729
I'm... I'm not sure what happened,

341
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,096
but... I just came from there,

342
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:16,865
and there's no survivors.

343
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:19,801
What about our friends? Sayid, Kate.

344
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,103
They... they weren't there.

345
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,272
Maybe they made it out alive.

346
00:20:24,273 --> 00:20:27,641
All I know is whatever you're
looking for at the temple...

347
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:30,511
it's not there.

348
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,213
You didn't want to go back
there. Did you know about this?

349
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:35,648
Jacob kinda sorta hinted that.

350
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,617
You spoke to Jacob?

351
00:20:37,618 --> 00:20:38,951
Yeah.

352
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,789
Well, whatever he said, don't believe him.

353
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:49,394
- Where you going?
- There's something I need to do.

354
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,529
To do what?

355
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,465
Die.

356
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,168
Hey, do you have a minute?

357
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:07,845
Yes, I guess. Might as
well just give 'em all F's.

358
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,234
Tell me, how hard is it

359
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:12,284
to learn the difference
between a genus and a species?

360
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:13,859
What do you want?

361
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:17,791
You're pretty good with
computers, aren't you?

362
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:19,528
Something tells me you
wouldn't even be standing here

363
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,192
if you didn't already know that I was.

364
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:23,717
Could you, hypothetically,

365
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:26,632
access someone's e-mail
account without their knowledge?

366
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,166
I... yeah, it depends on the account.

367
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,468
Say a faculty account.

368
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,069
Hypothetically.

369
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,404
Whose?

370
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,005
Nurse Kondracki.

371
00:21:36,006 --> 00:21:38,607
Kim? Why? Do you got the hots for her?

372
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,876
No. I'm just...

373
00:21:40,877 --> 00:21:44,312
I'm curious about some
of her correspondence.

374
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:46,880
With whom?

375
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:51,850
Okay. That's fine.

376
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,819
I didn't come to see
you. You came to see me.

377
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,954
I don't have time to play 20 questions.

378
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:59,823
Now you can either tell me
what it is that you're doing,

379
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:00,975
or you can let me finish

380
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:03,326
grading my papers in
peace. All right, all right.

381
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:06,396
I have reason to believe
that she might be engaged

382
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:09,332
in an inappropriate personal relationship

383
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,500
with principal Reynolds.

384
00:22:11,501 --> 00:22:15,103
You're making a play.

385
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:17,506
You're going after the
big job, aren't you?

386
00:22:17,507 --> 00:22:20,375
Are you going to help me or not, Leslie?

387
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,845
I want a good spot.

388
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:26,179
I'm sorry?

389
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,980
I want Lamar's spot in
the main parking lot...

390
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:29,948
the one next to the maple tree.

391
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,158
Not under the maple tree...
next to the maple tree.

392
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,410
That way, I get the
shade from the maple tree

393
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,513
but not all that tree crap
all over the hood of my car.

394
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,808
And I want aprons. I want lots of aprons.

395
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,407
And I want some lab equipment in here

396
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:43,295
- that was built in this decade. Is that a deal?
- Deal.

397
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:48,464
You know, you really had me
fooled with that sweater vest.

398
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:52,967
Linus, you're a real killer.

399
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,951
Been here before?

400
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:50,053
Yes.

401
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,425
And in all the time that
I've spent on this island,

402
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:58,861
today is the first time
I've ever come back.

403
00:23:58,862 --> 00:24:01,462
Jack? Dude, where are ya?

404
00:24:01,463 --> 00:24:04,129
I'm in here.

405
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,093
Do not open that.
There's dynamite in there.

406
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:25,503
- It's mega-unstable.
- I know.

407
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:26,571
So did Dr. Arzt...

408
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:29,222
Then I was wiping him out
of my shirt two days later.

409
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,952
- Dude, it's time to go.
- No, not yet.

410
00:24:32,953 --> 00:24:34,920
He's opening up a crate of dynamite,

411
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:37,822
- and he said he wanted to kill himself.
- I can't kill myself.

412
00:24:37,823 --> 00:24:39,121
What?

413
00:24:39,122 --> 00:24:41,456
Even if I wanted to...
and trust me, I do...

414
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,691
I... I can't kill myself.

415
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:46,226
Which is why I want you to do it for me.

416
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:50,064
What are you talking about?

417
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,800
What I'm talking about, Jack, is that...

418
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:55,136
Well, Jacob touched me.

419
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:58,172
And when Jacob touches you...
well, it's considered a gift.

420
00:24:58,173 --> 00:25:01,075
Except it's not a gift at all.

421
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:03,678
It's a curse.

422
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,312
Dude!

423
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:06,980
Seriously, let's go now!

424
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:09,381
Why do you want to die?

425
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,116
I devoted my life...

426
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:14,019
longer than you can possibly imagine...

427
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,887
in service of a man who told me

428
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:18,556
that everything was
happening for a reason,

429
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:20,557
that he had a plan...

430
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,059
a plan that I was a part of...

431
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,429
and when the time was right
that he'd share it with me.

432
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,398
And now that man's gone.

433
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:30,333
So why do I want to die?

434
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:33,402
Because I just found out my
entire life had no purpose.

435
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:38,674
Now if I light this
myself, it... it won't work.

436
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:41,076
But you can light it for me, Jack.

437
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:44,879
I made the fuse long enough
so you'll have time to get out.

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,947
Jack, please tell me you're
not actually considering this.

439
00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:48,949
If he wants to die,

440
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,384
there's nothing we're
gonna do to stop him.

441
00:25:57,157 --> 00:25:58,991
Thank you.

442
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,510
Now...

443
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:29,513
Let's talk.

444
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,866
Jack! Dude, we gotta go.
Guy's crazy, and I know crazy.

445
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:42,236
- Hurley, go ahead. We'll be all right.
- Dude, you're gonna blow up!

446
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,194
Gotta talk to him, Hurley.

447
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:46,262
- Just go.
- No, I'm not going without you.

448
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:48,796
Hurley, I'll be fine.

449
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:55,734
If you change your mind,
I'll be, like, a mile away.

450
00:26:55,735 --> 00:26:58,770
- You should go with him, Jack.
- No, Richard. No, I shouldn't.

451
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,771
Then you're gonna die.

452
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:04,174
Actually, I don't think
either one of us is gonna die.

453
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:06,343
What makes you think that?

454
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,911
I just came from a lighthouse

455
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:11,313
where my name was etched in wood

456
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:14,048
on a dial that turned a mirror

457
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,318
that somehow reflected the image
of the house that I grew up in.

458
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:22,557
Jacob's lighthouse.

459
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,826
He got Hurley to bring me out there

460
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:27,495
because he wanted me to see what
was reflected in that mirror.

461
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:29,399
For some reason, he wanted me to know

462
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,702
that he had been watching
me ever since I was a kid.

463
00:27:33,703 --> 00:27:35,504
Why?

464
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:38,107
I have no idea why.

465
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:41,811
But I'm willing to bet you that
if Jacob went to that trouble,

466
00:27:41,812 --> 00:27:44,747
that he brought me to
this island for a reason,

467
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:48,817
and it's not to blow up
sitting here with you right now.

468
00:27:48,818 --> 00:27:52,353
- That's a pretty big risk you're taking, Jack.
- Yes.

469
00:27:52,354 --> 00:27:55,723
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

470
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,909
Want to try another stick?

471
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:32,181
All right, Jack.

472
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:35,118
You seem to have all the
answers. So... so now what?

473
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,154
We go back to where we started.

474
00:29:08,106 --> 00:29:10,206
Hello, Ben.

475
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:15,510
What are you doing here?

476
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:20,649
Visiting. What are you doing?

477
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,717
Why?

478
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:26,419
Because you talked me into killing Jacob.

479
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,555
Do you see that woman
over there eating a mango?

480
00:29:29,556 --> 00:29:33,925
She's his bodyguard,
and she knows what I did.

481
00:29:33,926 --> 00:29:37,194
So you've got what you wanted
because she's going to kill me.

482
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:39,930
I don't want you to die, Ben.

483
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:42,498
In fact, I went back to the statue
to get you, but you'd already gone.

484
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:45,133
Get me? For what?

485
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:48,335
I'm gathering a group to
leave this place for good.

486
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,903
But once we're gone,

487
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:54,006
someone's gonna need to
be in charge of the island.

488
00:29:54,007 --> 00:29:55,974
Me?

489
00:29:55,975 --> 00:29:59,209
I can't think of a better man for the job.

490
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,311
Well, it doesn't seem
very likely, does it,

491
00:30:02,312 --> 00:30:04,646
under the circumstances?

492
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:06,948
How am I gonna get away from...

493
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,352
Come to the other island,
to the hydra station.

494
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,888
- That's where we'll be.
- She'll come after me.

495
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,290
200 yards inland, there's
a tree in the clearing

496
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:21,292
with a rifle leaning up against it.

497
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,295
If you go now, you'll get there first

498
00:30:23,296 --> 00:30:25,264
and you'll have the drop on her.

499
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:27,299
But don't hesitate.

500
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,235
She won't.

501
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,970
See you soon, Ben.

502
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:49,384
Hey!

503
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:01,992
Come in.

504
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,229
Linus, I don't have time

505
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,731
to listen to you complain about detention.

506
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:11,833
That's not why I'm here. I
want you to read something.

507
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:15,836
Well, if this some attempt
to revive your little club...

508
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,241
Those are 30 e-mails that
cover a 3-month period.

509
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:27,945
It's pretty lascivious stuff,

510
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,447
which would be fine if it was private,

511
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:32,415
but they seem to describe

512
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:34,716
acts that took place on school property...

513
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:37,952
acts which, morality aside,

514
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:40,287
I think the school board would frown on,

515
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,122
not to mention your wife.

516
00:31:45,192 --> 00:31:49,361
What do you want?

517
00:31:49,362 --> 00:31:52,029
You're gonna resign...

518
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,732
for, I don't know...

519
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,300
personal reasons, health. Your call.

520
00:31:57,301 --> 00:31:59,268
But with your resignation,
you're gonna recommend

521
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:01,570
that the school board hire
me as your replacement.

522
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,338
And the irony of all this

523
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:06,140
is that they hold you in such esteem

524
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:08,076
that I'll get the job.

525
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:13,415
So... do we have an understanding?

526
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:19,391
Linus...

527
00:32:19,392 --> 00:32:21,693
May I read you an e-mail?

528
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:31,400
"Dear principal Reynolds,

529
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:33,869
I would appreciate it if you could write

530
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,771
a letter of recommendation
to Yale on my behalf.

531
00:32:36,772 --> 00:32:39,341
It would mean the world to me.

532
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:42,112
Sincerely, Alexandra Rousseau."

533
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:45,383
It's a funny thing about
recommendations, Linus.

534
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:47,051
They work both ways.

535
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:49,120
So...

536
00:32:49,121 --> 00:32:53,290
I put the ball back in your court.

537
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:57,127
You can execute your little
Machiavellian maneuvers,

538
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:59,562
go for my job, sit at my desk.

539
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:04,032
But, alas, there will be an
unfortunate side effect...

540
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:06,635
I will torch Miss Rousseau

541
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,937
and her future.

542
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:13,375
Is my job, my power,
that important to you?

543
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:18,613
So...

544
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,982
What'll it be, Dr. Linus?

545
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,602
Drop it!

546
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,170
Put the gun down!

547
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,989
What are you waiting for?

548
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:05,459
I want to explain.

549
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,427
Explain what?

550
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,864
I want to explain that I
know what you're feeling.

551
00:34:11,865 --> 00:34:14,533
You have no idea what I'm feeling.

552
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:19,137
I watched my daughter
Alex die in front of me.

553
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,540
And it was my fault.

554
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:28,911
I had a chance to save her,

555
00:34:28,912 --> 00:34:31,312
but I chose the island...

556
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,647
Over her.

557
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:36,617
All in the name of Jacob.

558
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:41,921
I sacrificed everything for him...

559
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,992
And he didn't even care.

560
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:50,661
Yeah, I stabbed him.

561
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:53,731
I was... so angry..

562
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:55,667
Confused.

563
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:58,770
I... I was terrified
that I was about to lose

564
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:01,305
the only thing that had
ever mattered to me...

565
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:04,740
my power.

566
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:09,810
But the thing that really mattered...

567
00:35:09,811 --> 00:35:12,279
Was already gone.

568
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,349
I'm sorry that I killed Jacob.

569
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,384
I am.

570
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,986
And I do not expect you to forgive me

571
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,522
because...

572
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:27,491
I can never forgive myself.

573
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:30,394
Then what do you want?

574
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:34,831
Just... let me leave.

575
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,167
Where will you go?

576
00:35:40,903 --> 00:35:42,704
To Locke.

577
00:35:42,705 --> 00:35:44,972
Why?

578
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:48,775
Because he's the only one that'll have me.

579
00:35:53,947 --> 00:35:55,614
I'll have you.

580
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,060
Dr. Linus.

581
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:46,596
- Hello, Alex.
- I was just coming by to thank Principal Reynolds.

582
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:49,632
He wrote me the most incredible
letter of recommendation.

583
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:51,300
Wow. Wonderful.

584
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:53,835
Did you have something to do with it?

585
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:57,106
I mean, I thought he
might say some nice things,

586
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,975
- but he really went all out.
- No, it wasn't me, Alex.

587
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,876
But it always say you're a great student.

588
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:03,945
Obviously, I wasn't the
only one who noticed.

589
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,213
Thanks, doctor...

590
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:08,482
Linus, what the hell are
you doing in my office?

591
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:11,318
Just dropping off the detention
sign-up sheet for the week,

592
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,987
per your request.

593
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:15,155
Just put it on my desk.

594
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,827
So will I see you at history club?

595
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:21,479
Uh, you mean when it's back on?

596
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,397
Oh, no, we've got our old slot back.

597
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:25,364
Principal Reynolds found
someone to cover for detention.

598
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:27,998
Isn't that right?

599
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,566
Yes, that's right.

600
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,068
Well, then, see you at 4:00.

601
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,303
Bye.

602
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,282
Hey. Did you do it?

603
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:47,450
No.

604
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,418
No?

605
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:51,253
No?! Wait.

606
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:53,188
What... what about my parking space?

607
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:54,723
You can have mine.

608
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:04,912
Do you need a hand?

609
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:08,848
Please help me with the tarp.

610
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,445
Sir, there are people on the beach.

611
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:12,341
Should we stop?

612
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:14,410
No.

613
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:16,078
Proceed as planned.

614
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,012
Yes, sir, Mr. Widmore.

615
