1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:01,412
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Remember that bamboo field you woke
up in when you first got here?

3
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08,156
Beyond that field, across the ridge,
is the heart of the island.

4
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,812
That's where the light is.
That's where he's trying to go.

5
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,549
And what you have to protect.

6
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:14,628
How long am I gonna have to do this job?

7
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:16,012
As long as you can.

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,228
Drink this.

9
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,292
Now you're like me.

10
00:00:22,427 --> 00:00:25,273
- This is the well I threw Desmond Hume into.
- Aah!

11
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:28,493
- Looks like someone helped him out.
- No, Ben, someone helped me out.

12
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,678
I'm gonna find Desmond.

13
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:34,082
And when I do,
I'm gonna destroy the island.

14
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:36,151
There was a hit-and-run a few days ago

15
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:38,753
at Washington Tustin High School.

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,922
- Yeah?
- I'm the suspect.

17
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,560
Good afternoon.
And how are you doing today?

18
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:46,928
Terrific.

19
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,432
I think it's time to leave.

20
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,134
You're with him, and you're with me.

21
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,303
We are going to a concert.

22
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,639
Let's go.

23
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,103
- Do you need somebody to sign for that?
- You work here?

24
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,839
I do indeed, brother.

25
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,242
You a priest or somethin'?

26
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:49,778
Or something.

27
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:54,149
Do you mind taking it
around the back there?

28
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:56,518
Yeah, sure. You got it.

29
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,397
Just around there. Thank you.

30
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:22,944
Who died?

31
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,581
A man named Christian Shephard.

32
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:30,885
"Christian Shephard"?

33
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,887
Seriously?

34
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:35,190
Seriously.

35
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,528
Friend of yours?

36
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:41,863
Not exactly.

37
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,331
H... hang on a second.

38
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:46,334
You bust me out of jail and
make me put on this dress

39
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,336
so that we can go to some concert,

40
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,972
and you won't even tell me why we're here?

41
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:54,809
No one can tell you why you're here, Kate.

42
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,512
- Certainly not me.
- You're the one who brought me here.

43
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:01,015
I'm not talking about the church.

44
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,718
I'm talking about here.

45
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:06,321
Who are you?

46
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:09,357
What do you want?

47
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,826
My name is Desmond Hume.

48
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,597
And even though you don't realize it,
I'm your friend.

49
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:18,199
And as for what I want...

50
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,604
I want to leave.

51
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:29,677
Leave and go where?

52
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:32,580
Let me show you.

53
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:05,580
You okay?

54
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:09,117
Yeah.

55
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,119
You?

56
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:13,655
Well, to be honest, doc,
I'm kinda wondering

57
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,157
what the hell just happened up here.

58
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,527
That makes two of us.

59
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,566
So you're the new Jacob, huh?

60
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:28,736
Feel any different?

61
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:30,939
Not really.

62
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,975
Well, doc, how about you
come down off the mountaintop

63
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,313
and tell us what the hell the
burning bush had to say for itself?

64
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:43,184
Jacob told me that we have to go to the
bamboo forest out past our old camp.

65
00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:44,686
Just past it, well,

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,522
he said I'd find the place
that we need to protect.

67
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:50,258
This place... what is it?

68
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,327
He called it the heart of the island.

69
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:54,729
All he said was that it's...

70
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,264
it's a light.

71
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,935
And that Locke smoke thing
wants to put it out?

72
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,971
Something like that, yeah.

73
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,306
So what if he does?

74
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,542
Then that's it for all of us.

75
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:13,281
But... but if Locke wants to put it out,
then why hasn't he?

76
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,884
'Cause he ain't got what he needs.

77
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,354
I'm guessing that'd be Desmond.

78
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:21,689
That's where we were headed
before your inauguration.

79
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,125
Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.

80
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,127
Jacob didn't say anything
to me about Desmond.

81
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:28,129
Doesn't sound like he said
anything about anything.

82
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:31,566
That's kinda true, dude.
He's worse than Yoda.

83
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,168
All right, y'all head to
your heart of the island,

84
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,170
and I'll go get the magic
leprechaun out of that well.

85
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,707
If we leave a trail,
can you catch up with us?

86
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:42,744
- Hell, yeah, I can.
- Then be safe.

87
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:47,215
I'd ask you along,
but that'd take all the fun

88
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:49,717
- out of me telling you you can't come.
- Uh, I guess

89
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,754
I'll just have to resist the
urge to follow you anyway.

90
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,460
I got a bad feeling about this.

www.Addic7ed.Com

94
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,527
I don't know why you got me out of prison,

95
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:45,529
what you want or who you are,

96
00:08:45,564 --> 00:08:47,648
but you understand I can't
be held responsible for...

97
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,632
Yeah, yeah, whatever, dude.

98
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,105
None of this is ringing a bell, is it?

99
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,708
You, me... tranquilizer gun?

100
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,877
You are insane.

101
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:02,780
Okay. Fine. I'm insane. Just wait here.

102
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:04,882
What if I don't?

103
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,818
Then that's your choice.

104
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:10,821
But if you stick with me...

105
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:13,023
you'll be happy you did.

106
00:09:20,432 --> 00:09:23,033
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:09:32,677 --> 00:09:36,347
"Do no disturb" sign.

108
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,848
Who are you?

109
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:41,285
Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?

110
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,489
Uh, you have a concert to perform tonight,

111
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:47,992
and I'm here to pick you up.

112
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,361
Didn't I make it clear to
Widmore's other monkey?

113
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,363
I don't care about a sodding concert.

114
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,132
Charlie...

115
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,635
Charlie, what if I told you that...

116
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:04,608
playing this show is the most
important thing you'll ever do?

117
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,577
Would you come then?

118
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,014
Sod off.

119
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:16,020
Okay, dude. Sorry about this.

120
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:35,806
What was that?

121
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,308
That was Charlie.

122
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:46,784
Why did you take the job, Jack?

123
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,286
Because I was supposed to.

124
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:53,557
Why? Because some stranger
wrote our names on a wall?

125
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:56,560
I took it because the
island's all I've got left.

126
00:10:56,594 --> 00:11:00,230
It's the only thing in my life
I haven't managed to ruin.

127
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:03,834
You haven't ruined anything.

128
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:06,570
Nothing is irreversible.

129
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:11,175
This would be so sweet if
we weren't all about to die.

130
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,462
As long as you're watching,
why don't you join us?

131
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:41,705
What are you doing here, James?

132
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,208
I heard Desmond fell in the well,

133
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:47,211
so I came to help him get out.

134
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,448
Looks like somebody beat
us both to the punch.

135
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,783
Oh, well.

136
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,952
Do you know why I'm here?

137
00:11:54,986 --> 00:11:57,721
I'm guessing you need Desmond
to destroy the island.

138
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:01,058
That's absolutely right.

139
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:04,061
Then what, Smokey?
You going down with the ship?

140
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:06,663
Suicide doesn't seem like your style.

141
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,665
I'm not going down with anything.

142
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,237
But you and the rest of Jacob's little
"candidates" absolutely are.

143
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,773
We're not candidates anymore.

144
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:18,075
Ohh! Oh!

145
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,513
Aah.

146
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,982
I'll be seein' ya.

147
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,486
You're not gonna go after him?

148
00:12:29,521 --> 00:12:31,522
I don't need to.

149
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,791
When you said you were
gonna destroy the island,

150
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,993
I thought you were speaking figuratively.

151
00:12:36,027 --> 00:12:40,330
Because I said I'd leave you
in charge once I was gone?

152
00:12:40,365 --> 00:12:45,769
I'm sorry if I left out the part about
the island being on the bottom of the
ocean.

153
00:12:45,804 --> 00:12:48,305
That being said, you're
welcome to join me on my boat.

154
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:51,275
Because once we get Desmond
to do what we need him to do,

155
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:57,080
I'm gonna sail away from this
godforsaken place and watch it sink.

156
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:06,323
I think there was a dog here.

157
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:17,568
Morning.

158
00:13:20,438 --> 00:13:22,639
Morning.

159
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,541
Sleep okay?

160
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:26,543
Aye.

161
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:28,812
Your camp's a lot nicer
than the bottom of a well.

162
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:32,382
I think I'm gonna go ahead and
take that as a compliment.

163
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,384
Are you gonna talk his ear off,

164
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,720
or you gonna get the man some breakfast?

165
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:39,256
Guess I'll go check the traps for fish.

166
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,558
Come on. Vincent.

167
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:43,961
Let's go.

168
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:48,398
So, Rose, tell me...

169
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:51,401
how long have the two
of you been living here?

170
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:54,438
Well, we built this place in '75,

171
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:57,207
and... lived here a couple of years,

172
00:13:57,242 --> 00:14:00,544
and then the sky lit up again.

173
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:04,181
So God only knows when
in the hell we are now.

174
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,918
So...

175
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:09,920
Desmond...

176
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,922
I don't mean to be rude,

177
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:15,526
but after you eat,
I'm gonna ask you to move on.

178
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:18,962
We broke our rule with you.

179
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:21,231
What rule is that?

180
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,100
We don't get involved.

181
00:14:23,134 --> 00:14:26,603
Whatever got you tossed inside a well...

182
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:31,608
that's the kind of drama Bernard and I
don't want to have anything to do with.

183
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:33,777
Fair enough.

184
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:40,551
Looks like you caught something.

185
00:14:40,585 --> 00:14:42,586
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:55,599
Hello, Rose.

187
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,441
I'll make this simple.

188
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:06,310
Come with me now

189
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:09,079
or I'll kill them both
right in front of you.

190
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,283
You don't have to go anywhere with him.

191
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,455
I'll make it hurt.

192
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,401
I want your word

193
00:15:31,436 --> 00:15:34,037
you won't touch them.

194
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:35,439
Ever.

195
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,375
Done.

196
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,278
Then I'll do what you want.

197
00:15:41,312 --> 00:15:43,747
Yes, Desmond.

198
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:48,885
You will.

199
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:02,571
You have any idea where
I'm taking you, Desmond?

200
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:04,707
No.

201
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:07,710
But I assume it's a place where
there's a very bright light.

202
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:13,449
What makes you say that?

203
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:16,085
Oh... just a hunch.

204
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,758
- What was that?
- What was what?

205
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:37,373
Linus, can you hear me? Come in.

206
00:16:38,808 --> 00:16:40,442
I found Alpert.

207
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,012
Linus?

208
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:45,314
Damn it.

209
00:16:49,252 --> 00:16:50,486
You okay?

210
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,888
What... what... what happened?

211
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:58,127
You thought it'd be a good idea
to talk to the black smoke.

212
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:00,629
It responded by throwing
you into the damn jungle.

213
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:02,298
Locke. L...

214
00:17:02,332 --> 00:17:04,667
- is he still here?
- No.

215
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,535
Here.

216
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,538
I've been trying to get
Linus on the walkie.

217
00:17:09,573 --> 00:17:11,073
He won't pick up.

218
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:14,843
- Come on. Let's get you some help.
- Help? Help? Help from where?

219
00:17:14,878 --> 00:17:17,313
You still have the explosives?
The... the c-4?

220
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:18,881
Yeah. Why?

221
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,150
Because we need to go to the other
island and finish what we started.

222
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:24,620
We need to blow up that plane.

223
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,015
- Detective Ford.
- Jim, it's me.

224
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:56,118
- I think I just saw that Jarrah guy.
- You at county lockup?

225
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:59,221
No, I'm at my dad's museum
concert benefit thing.

226
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,223
Well, it can't be Jarrah.

227
00:18:01,257 --> 00:18:03,359
- I just put him in a van to county an hour ago.
- Really?

228
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:06,762
- Because I just called, and they said it never showed up.
- What?

229
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:08,731
Help me out here, Jim.

230
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:10,799
Jarrah popped four people in cold blood.

231
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,835
Only one witness left
the scene alive, right?

232
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:14,337
Some Korean woman.
Can you make sure she's okay?

233
00:18:14,338 --> 00:18:15,804
Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik.

234
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,941
Gunshot wound. She's still
over at the hospital.

235
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:21,243
Enjoy your concert, Enos.
I'll keep her safe.

236
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:57,079
Am I interrupting?

237
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,784
Hi.

238
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:04,453
Ms. Paik, I'm Juliet Carlson.

239
00:19:04,487 --> 00:19:06,488
I'm here to make sure your baby's okay.

240
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,659
You must be the daddy.

241
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,964
I'm sorry. You don't speak English.

242
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,101
I'm... I'll try not to talk too much.

243
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,013
Okay, you lift up your gown a little bit.

244
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:41,490
It's a little cold.

245
00:19:48,064 --> 00:19:49,798
Okay. Let's take a look.

246
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:04,480
You Okay?

247
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:17,326
There it is. 

248
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,695
There's your baby.

249
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:07,242
Do you see that little flutter?

250
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,078
Right there?

251
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:12,047
That's the baby's heartbeat.

252
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:16,185
Perfectly perfect in every way.

253
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,325
I have your amnio results.
Everything checked out.

254
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,328
Would you like to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

255
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:29,097
It's a girl.

256
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:31,266
Yeah.

257
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:34,069
Her name is Ji Yeon.

258
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:36,371
That's a lovely name.

259
00:21:36,406 --> 00:21:39,908
And for the record, y...
you two speak English just fine.

260
00:21:41,211 --> 00:21:42,711
Congratulations.

261
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,267
Whoa! Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me.

262
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:04,669
I found Locke.

263
00:22:04,704 --> 00:22:07,139
Son of a bitch said he's
gonna destroy the island.

264
00:22:07,173 --> 00:22:08,907
You had it right, doc.

265
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:11,476
Good news is, Desmond
got out of that well,

266
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:15,480
- so if we can find him before Smokey can...
- It doesn't matter if we find Desmond or he does, James.

267
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:17,682
We're all going to the same place anyway.

268
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,918
Then what?

269
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,954
Then it ends.

270
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,446
- Hello, Mr. Locke.
- Dr. Shephard.

271
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:50,949
Hey, since you're about
to open up my back,

272
00:22:50,983 --> 00:22:52,951
you can probably start calling me John.

273
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,387
Okay, John.

274
00:22:55,421 --> 00:23:00,292
I thought I'd stop by and say hi
before we started the anesthesia.

275
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,860
You nervous?

276
00:23:04,163 --> 00:23:06,298
Are you sure this is gonna work?

277
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:08,033
Yes.

278
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,035
I'm very confident that it will.

279
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:12,037
Really?

280
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:15,407
Well, there's always the
chance that I could kill you...

281
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:19,711
But I'm trying to make you feel better.

282
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:21,880
Okay. Okay, let's do it.

283
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,016
All right. I'll see you on the other side.

284
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:28,987
Hey, doctor, back at L.A.X.
, when we met at baggage claim,

285
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,157
you mentioned that they
had lost your father.

286
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:33,209
Did he ever turn up?

287
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,147
As a matter of fact,
I got a phone call this morning.

288
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,030
- They, uh, they found the coffin.
- Oh, good.

289
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,466
Actually, it might be here already.

290
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,602
Well, I hope that brings you some peace.

291
00:23:43,636 --> 00:23:46,771
If I can fix you, Mr. Locke,

292
00:23:46,806 --> 00:23:49,140
that's all the peace I'll need.

293
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,324
That's gonna be a hell of a storm.

294
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,193
Welcome to the club.

295
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:09,895
What?

296
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,497
You mind?

297
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:18,069
Looks like you got your first gray hair.

298
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,949
What are you smiling about?

299
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,485
I think I just realized
that I want to live.

300
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,454
It's good timing.

301
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,470
What was that?

302
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,479
Help!

303
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,417
Hey!

304
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:07,752
Hey! Miles, up ahead!

305
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:13,692
Hey!

306
00:25:24,637 --> 00:25:25,937
Ohh.

307
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,639
Get him some water.

308
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,649
What are you guys doing out here?

309
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:40,652
We're going to hydra
island to blow up a plane.

310
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,521
What do you want to do that for?

311
00:25:43,556 --> 00:25:45,890
Because the black smoke
wants to get off the island,

312
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:49,227
and we have to stop
that thing from leaving.

313
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:52,864
Well, if we leave, that thing
won't have a plane anymore.

314
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,800
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that?

315
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:59,337
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a pilot.

316
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:29,534
- Well, this is gonna be interesting.
- Kate!

317
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,871
Kate!

318
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:35,273
You killed them!

319
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,208
Kate! That's it.

320
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:40,678
- That's it.
- You might wanna save your bullets.

321
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:47,118
So it's you.

322
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,720
Yeah, it's me.

323
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:52,757
Jacob being who he is, I expected
to be a little more surprised.

324
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:55,093
You're sort of the obvious choice,

325
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:58,029
- don't you think?
- He didn't choose me. I volunteered.

326
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,600
I assume you're here to stop me.

327
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:04,736
I can't stop you.

328
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,305
In fact, I, uh, I wanna go with you.

329
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,107
I'm sorry, Jack.

330
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:12,143
I think you're a little confused
about what I came here to do.

331
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:13,878
No, I'm not.

332
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:16,881
No, you're going to the far
side of the bamboo forest...

333
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:19,184
to the place that I've
sworn that I'll protect.

334
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,755
And then you think you're gonna
destroy the island.

335
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:24,589
I "think"?

336
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:27,358
That's right, because that's
not what's gonna happen.

337
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:32,130
Then what's gonna happen, Jack?

338
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:35,900
I'm gonna kill you.

339
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:42,273
How do you plan to do that?

340
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:45,143
It's a surprise.

341
00:27:49,715 --> 00:27:51,616
Okay.

342
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,551
Then let's get on with it.

343
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:06,815
Doctor.

344
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,584
Doctor.

345
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:10,586
I didn't know you were working today.

346
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,889
I just finished. Did you get
the tickets for the concert?

347
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:15,858
Yeah. Right here.

348
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,461
Hey, dad, did you remember the tickets?

349
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,231
I just gave them to your mom.

350
00:28:24,334 --> 00:28:27,302
- Uh, who's gonna take yours?
- Well, if you don't have anybody else,

351
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:29,304
maybe you could take aunt Claire.

352
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,608
- I'm sure she'd love to get out of the house.
- Oh, yeah. It's fine with me.

353
00:28:32,642 --> 00:28:35,043
In fact, I'm very curious to
meet this mysterious sister

354
00:28:35,078 --> 00:28:38,046
you never mentioned the
entire time we were married.

355
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:41,049
Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her.
She's extremely pregnant.

356
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:45,420
Good luck on your surgery, doctor.

357
00:28:45,455 --> 00:28:47,089
Thank you.

358
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:49,091
- Did you pick out a tie?
- I did.

359
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,126
Nice.

360
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:53,929
Sorry.

361
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:58,467
Hi. I'm Detective Ford, L.A.P.D.

362
00:28:58,501 --> 00:28:59,801
Mm-hmm.

363
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:03,472
I'm looking for a patient's
room... Sun Paik.

364
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,812
Something you wanna share
with the rest of us, doc?

365
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:12,481
What's that?

366
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,483
You said you were gonna kill Locke.

367
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:17,352
- What's your surprise?
- Desmond.

368
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,755
And how's that gonna work?

369
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,757
I'm not sure yet. I can't believe Jacob

370
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,959
would've brought him all
the way back to this island

371
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:25,961
just so Locke could make him destroy it.

372
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,463
- So what? Desmond's bait?
- No.

373
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:31,433
I think he's a weapon.

374
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,169
That's a hell of a long con, doc.

375
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:52,654
Jack, Desmond...

376
00:29:52,689 --> 00:29:56,425
it should just be the
three of us from here on.

377
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,508
Jack.

378
00:30:13,543 --> 00:30:15,444
I believe in you, dude.

379
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:36,365
It's gonna be a bad one.

380
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,682
We're here.

381
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:10,399
This doesn't matter, you know.

382
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,434
Excuse me?

383
00:31:12,468 --> 00:31:17,306
Him destroying the island,
you destroying him...

384
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,075
it doesn't matter.

385
00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:22,577
I mean, you're gonna
lower me into that light,

386
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:25,814
and I'm gonna go somewhere else...

387
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:29,584
a place where we can be
with the ones that we love

388
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:33,455
and not have to ever think
about this damn island again.

389
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:36,158
And you know the best part, Jack?

390
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,060
What?

391
00:31:38,094 --> 00:31:40,696
You're in this place.

392
00:31:42,432 --> 00:31:47,069
You know, we sat next to
each other on Oceanic 815.

393
00:31:48,671 --> 00:31:50,906
It never crashed.

394
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,275
We spoke to each other.

395
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,310
You seemed happy.

396
00:31:57,613 --> 00:32:01,283
You know, maybe I can find a
way to bring you there, too.

397
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:04,519
Desmond, I tried that once.

398
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,521
There are no shortcuts, no do-overs.

399
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:09,224
What happened, happened. Trust me, I know.

400
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,928
All of this matters.

401
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,731
Shall we?

402
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:52,245
What are we doing here?

403
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,016
I'm not allowed to tell you.

404
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,585
What do you mean, you're "not allowed"?

405
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,253
There are rules, dude.

406
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,588
Whose rules?

407
00:33:01,622 --> 00:33:04,691
Don't worry about it. Just trust me, okay?

408
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:07,961
I trust you.

409
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:12,432
And what, may I ask,
have I done to deserve your trust?

410
00:33:13,935 --> 00:33:16,570
I think you're a good guy, Sayid.

411
00:33:16,604 --> 00:33:20,040
I know a lot of people have
told you that you're not.

412
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:23,643
Maybe you've heard it so many
times you started believing it.

413
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,648
But you can't let other people
tell you what you are, dude.

414
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,917
You have to decide that for yourself.

415
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,288
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:35,323 --> 00:33:38,325
You clearly don't know
anything about me.

417
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:41,127
I know a lot about you, dude.

418
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:52,272
Ohh!

419
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:54,441
Looks like a gnarly fight.

420
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:02,616
Hey, leave my brother alone!

421
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,152
Uhh!

422
00:34:13,027 --> 00:34:14,027
Aah!

423
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:15,328
Uhh!

424
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:19,566
Hey, it's all right.

425
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,494
Sayid.

426
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:50,330
Shannon.

427
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:00,073
I just got pounded, man.

428
00:35:00,107 --> 00:35:02,075
Thanks for taking your sweet time.

429
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:05,679
It takes as long as it takes.

430
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:08,715
It was a pain in the ass getting
her here from Australia.

431
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:11,685
Yeah. But, dude? It was worth it.

432
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:17,490
Should I go get 'em?

433
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:21,461
Nah. Let's give 'em a minute.

434
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,544
Linus, are you there?

435
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:40,113
What the hell's that?

436
00:35:40,147 --> 00:35:41,781
Miles, where are you?

437
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,783
We just got to hydra island.

438
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:46,753
- We're on our way to the plane.
- Miles, listen to me.

439
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:50,156
- Whatever you do, don't blow up that plane!
- We're not gonna blow it up.

440
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,125
We're gonna fly it the hell off the
island. Just get over here now!

441
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,160
What in the hell?

442
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:59,699
Claire.

443
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:03,436
Miles, it's Kate. Did you say "Claire"?

444
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:06,039
Is she okay?

445
00:36:06,073 --> 00:36:08,575
Put the gun down.

446
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:12,979
Don't come any closer!

447
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:14,881
Miles?

448
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:17,917
Miles, what happened?

449
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,419
Miles, are you there?

450
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:21,588
He sent you to kill me, didn't he?

451
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:23,990
No, listen. We're not with Locke.

452
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:26,593
Why should I believe you?

453
00:36:26,627 --> 00:36:29,662
Because we have a real chance
to get far, far away from him.

454
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:35,568
We can be free of everything he
ever did to us and never look back.

455
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:37,871
We can go home.

456
00:36:43,277 --> 00:36:45,278
Will you come with us, Claire?

457
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:51,284
No.

458
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:05,765
All right, we...

459
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,767
we lower him down nice and easy.

460
00:37:07,802 --> 00:37:10,336
You know what to do
once you get down there?

461
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:12,839
Aye.

462
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,874
I'll go where the light's brightest.

463
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:19,012
Don't get yourself killed.

464
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:44,337
This remind you of anything, Jack?

465
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:47,640
What?

466
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,411
Desmond...

467
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:54,380
going down into a hole in the ground.

468
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:56,883
If there was a button down there to push,

469
00:37:56,917 --> 00:37:59,719
we could fight about
whether or not to push it.

470
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:01,721
It'd be just like old times.

471
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:04,224
You're not John Locke.

472
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:10,830
You disrespect his memory by wearing
his face, but you're nothing like him.

473
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:14,534
Turns out he was right
about most everything.

474
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:18,872
I just wish I could've told him
that while he was still alive.

475
00:38:18,906 --> 00:38:22,208
He wasn't right about anything,
Jack.

476
00:38:22,243 --> 00:38:24,144
And when this island

477
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:27,147
drops into the ocean,
and you drop with it,

478
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,215
you're finally gonna realize that.

479
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:35,989
Well, we'll just have to see
which one of us is right, then.

480
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,686
Oh.

481
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,055
It's the hospital.

482
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:17,090
Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.

483
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:19,626
I am so sorry. I will be
back as soon as I can.

484
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:20,727
I know. It's cool. Go.

485
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:23,014
We'll get to know each
other better, I hope?

486
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:25,265
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

487
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:30,037
Well, I, uh, I guess it's
just you and me, kid.

488
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:36,710
Oy.

489
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:38,211
Wake up.

490
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,414
Wake up. Come on. Wake up.

491
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,550
What are you doin'?

492
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,485
I'm just following the instructions.

493
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,921
You're in the band, aren't you?

494
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,956
How do you know that?

495
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:55,962
Oh.

496
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:58,765
I was shot by a fat man.

497
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,469
It's all right.

498
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:06,840
Excuse me.

499
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:10,444
Hey, excuse me.
Do you know where the band is?

500
00:40:11,846 --> 00:40:14,414
I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me?

501
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:16,416
I... I think he's in the band.

502
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,353
Yes, yes. Of course.

503
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:22,656
He's the bass player from drive shaft.

504
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,192
They're accompanying me tonight.

505
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:27,360
I play piano.

506
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,099
I'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

507
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:34,367
I'm Charlotte.

508
00:40:34,402 --> 00:40:37,037
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Charlotte.

509
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:40,307
You, too.

510
00:40:42,844 --> 00:40:46,246
Well, lead the way.

511
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,050
Excuse me. Is this table 23?

512
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:52,686
Aye. Indeed it is.

513
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:56,123
Claire?

514
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,691
I...

515
00:40:57,725 --> 00:41:00,127
You two know each other?

516
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:02,896
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

517
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,866
May I have your attention, please?

518
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,735
Welcome to this very
special benefit concert

519
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,838
for the golden state
natural history museum.

520
00:41:11,873 --> 00:41:15,809
I'm Dr. Pierre Chang.

521
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:17,811
Thank you.

522
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:20,747
I think we have quite a
special evening ahead of us.

523
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:23,416
So let's get to it, shall we?

524
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:27,554
It is my pleasure to introduce
you to Mr. Daniel Widmore,

525
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:29,923
accompanied by drive shaft.

526
00:42:26,314 --> 00:42:28,648
Mm.

527
00:42:28,683 --> 00:42:30,217
You okay?

528
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:33,753
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

529
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:35,722
I'll... I'll be right back.

530
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,230
No!

531
00:44:57,264 --> 00:45:01,234
No!

532
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:06,239
It looks like...

533
00:45:06,273 --> 00:45:07,941
you were wrong.

534
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:12,645
Good-bye, Jack.

535
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:25,792
Uhh!

536
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:39,706
Looks like you were wrong, too.

537
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:04,159
Um, hello?

538
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:06,695
Hello?

539
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:10,165
Hi. Uh, do you know where
the bathroom is? Mm! Ohh!

540
00:46:13,736 --> 00:46:16,138
Uh, can you please get a doctor?

541
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:18,306
Small world, huh?

542
00:46:18,341 --> 00:46:21,676
Yeah, well, what are you doing...
mm! Okay. Oh! Okay. Okay.

543
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:25,447
- It's okay. Come on. Sit down.
- Um, I... I think he's coming.

544
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:45,700
I thought I made it clear
that you were to stop this.

545
00:46:45,735 --> 00:46:47,335
Perfectly clear.

546
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,471
I chose to ignore you.

547
00:46:53,943 --> 00:46:55,911
And once they know... what then?

548
00:46:55,945 --> 00:46:57,112
Then?

549
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:59,314
We're leaving.

550
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:07,656
Are you going to take my son?

551
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:15,097
Not with me.

552
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:16,698
No.

553
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:24,106
Uhh!

554
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,475
Just breathe, okay? Just breathe,
breathe, breathe.

555
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,477
- Help is on the way.
- Mnh-mnh!

556
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,846
It's hap... it's happening,
like... like, right now.

557
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,780
Right now?

558
00:47:33,883 --> 00:47:35,851
Um...

559
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:38,887
Okay. Um... I'm gonna get you comfortable.

560
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,623
I want you to relax and
breathe, all right?

561
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:44,459
- Just relax and breathe.
- Who are you?

562
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,895
I'm with the band.

563
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,997
Listen, can you get us some
water and blankets, please?

564
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:50,065
Water and blankets?

565
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,567
Yeah. All right. Uh...

566
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:54,636
Claire...

567
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,438
This is about the time

568
00:47:56,472 --> 00:47:58,540
when you're supposed to start pushing.

569
00:47:58,574 --> 00:48:01,576
Mnh-mnh. No, I'm not ready.
I'm... I'm really scared.

570
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:04,546
I'm scared, too,
all right? Really scared.

571
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,149
But I'm gonna need you to push because

572
00:48:07,183 --> 00:48:10,152
I can't do it without you. Okay?

573
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:11,319
Okay.

574
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:13,889
One, two, three. Push!

575
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,827
That's good. That's good.
Okay, we're gonna try again.

576
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:20,929
You're doing good.

577
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:23,565
One, two, three. Push!

578
00:48:32,942 --> 00:48:38,446
Oh. Uh... okay. Push... push again.

579
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:39,581
Push!

580
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,544
Oh!

581
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:20,121
Shh.

582
00:49:20,156 --> 00:49:22,357
It's Aaron.

583
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:23,858
It's...

584
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,581
I brought a blanket.

585
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:56,491
Thank you.

586
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,426
It's just a blanket.

587
00:49:58,461 --> 00:50:01,396
Then go ahead and bring it to her.

588
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:06,534
Couldn't find any water.

589
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,048
Charlie.

590
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:43,772
Claire?

591
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:44,939
Yeah.

592
00:50:44,974 --> 00:50:47,976
Claire.

593
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:58,486
Hi, Aaron.

594
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:00,889
Aaron. Hey.

595
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:08,463
Aaron.

596
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:10,665
Hey, Aaron.

597
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,640
Do you understand?

598
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:24,713
So now what?

599
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:44,232
Hugo! Get out of the way!

600
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:50,839
Ohh!

601
00:52:19,602 --> 00:52:21,603
Desmond!

602
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,675
Desmond!

603
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,018
We're gonna get you out
of here, all right?

604
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:42,190
It's too damn heavy!

605
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:45,427
There's no way we're gettin'
it off of him! We have to try!

606
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:47,595
One... two... three!

607
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,507
What is happening?!

608
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:02,076
I'll tell you what's happening!
Locke was right!
