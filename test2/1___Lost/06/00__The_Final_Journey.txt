1
00:00:00,666 --> 00:00:02,934
It began in the blink of an eye.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,893
A plane crash...

3
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:09,246
A group of survivors...

4
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:10,557
- I'm Kate.
- Jack.

5
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:12,838
An island of mystery.

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,886
This place is different.

7
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:18,470
The scope of it seemed epic.

8
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,350
Come on, Freckles. Don't
we deserve somethin' good?

9
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:24,077
- I was blown away by it.
- Where are you?!

10
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:26,205
This was something that
hadn't been done before

11
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,918
- in terms of prime time TV.
- We're not alone.

12
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,254
You could tell it was...
it was gonna be cool.

13
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,478
As the story of the Oceanic
survivors began to unfold...

14
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:35,749
Lift!

15
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,709
"Lost" became a phenomenon.

16
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,469
-  Whoo!
- The pilot really blasted off.

17
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:44,686
And captured the imagination
of audiences around the world.

18
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,134
- Guys, where are we?
- When however many million people watched it,

19
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:52,165
- I thought, this looks like it might do all right.
- It took me by surprise.

20
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,821
- We were changing the face of American television.
- We're here.

21
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:59,718
- It seemed to use the medium of television...
- I think there's something down... aah!

22
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:02,942
- In a truly creative way.
- Kate, damn it, run!

23
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,837
I don't know of another scripted show

24
00:01:05,949 --> 00:01:08,789
that has had as much
impact on the culture.

25
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:10,454
Help me! Dad!

26
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,238
Walt!

27
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,870
Variety, mystery,

28
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:16,638
the big questions, international casting,

29
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:19,925
the unbelievably scenic backdrop.

30
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:23,461
It's a tale of survival...

31
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,093
- Of redemption...
- Nothing in my life has ever felt so right.

32
00:01:29,253 --> 00:01:30,181
Of faith.

33
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,302
Why did you do this?! Why?!

34
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:34,869
But at its core,

35
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:36,870
"Lost" is a story about
a group of people...

36
00:01:37,949 --> 00:01:40,775
If we can't live together,
we're gonna die alone.

37
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:43,414
- Whom we've come to know and love...
- I love you, Penny.

38
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,277
Over the past six seasons.

39
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:48,573
- Why do you find it so hard to believe?
- Why do you find it so easy?

40
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:50,022
It's never been easy!

41
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,077
Tonight, before the final
chapter comes to a close...

42
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,934
- What does he want from me? !
- I don't know, Jack!

43
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:57,541
We're taking a look back...

44
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,158
to remember how they loved...

45
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:04,893
- They were all talking about all the chemistry there.
- And lost...

46
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,829
I was pretty moved and I
actually got kind of emotional.

47
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,941
- How they fought...
- I had a life here!

48
00:02:10,773 --> 00:02:13,029
Charlie!

49
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,286
And died.

50
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,878
It affected everyone a
lot more than we expected.

51
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:20,886
The cast of "Lost" join producers
Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse

52
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,670
- to share their experiences...
- In breaking all these rules,

53
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:26,630
- that was what made "Lost" special.
- Let me out!

54
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,110
This only happens to
somebody once in a lifetime,

55
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,781
- if they're lucky.
- Go!

56
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:35,758
It's changed my life.
- And celebrate the story that captured our hearts...

57
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:38,006
- You have to go.
- I won't leave you.

58
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,413
Challenged our minds...

59
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:45,205
- And touched our lives.
- Juliet!

60
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:48,718
I came in one person and
I'm going out another person,

61
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,780
- and I'll be forever grateful.
- I'll see you in another life, brother.

62
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:56,670
- My vision went from here to here, you know, just like that.
- We were brought here because

63
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:59,165
- we're supposed to do something, James.
- Sayid!

64
00:02:59,927 --> 00:03:02,111
I'm so happy with how
it's all coming to an end,

65
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,326
- and it... it just feels so right.
- You just have to trust me.

66
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,453
Here we go.

67
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:09,789
Quite a journey, y'all.

68
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:13,429

69
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,605
This journey began in Sydney, Australia,

70
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:23,244
where a group of passengers
boarded Oceanic Flight 815

71
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,766
bound for Los Angeles.

72
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:28,900
Strangers, but with something in common...

73
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,749
they were all flawed and
facing their struggles alone.

74
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:37,396
But what they would experience
together would change them forever.

75
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,557
The story that started six years ago

76
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:44,804
concludes tonight, so let
us go back to the beginning,

77
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:49,597
where the television drama that
became a world phenomenon began.

78
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:55,349
I decided to go out on
auditions during a pilot season.

79
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:57,845
I figured, if anything, I'd get, you know,

80
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:00,789
a nice little Hawaiian
vacation out of doing the pilot.

81
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,268
Then when I saw the script, it
seemed really ambitious to me.

82
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:06,268
I thought it was one of the best
pieces of material that I'd ever read.

83
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,301
I knew that it was something unusual

84
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:10,277
just because of the
collective intelligence

85
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,605
- of the people in the room, probably.
- The first thing that stood
out was the... the scope of it.

86
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,253
You know, it seemed epic.

87
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:20,301
I really got a sense that it would afford

88
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,549
- a lot of opportunity to explore human nature.
- Don't worry.

89
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,365
Uhh!

90
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,645
That was January of 2004 when
I went for my first audition.

91
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:35,926
By March 2004, I was in Hawaii
filming the pilot of "Lost."

92
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:43,444
Help!

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,108
On September 22, 2004,

94
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,725
"Lost" premiered in the U.S.,

95
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,637
and over 18 million
viewers were captivated.

96
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,781
Help me! Will you please help me?

97
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:58,925
The pilot was such a great experience.

98
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,797
I mean, it was insane just
going to that beach every day.

99
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:04,557
- I'm having contractions.
- How many months pregnant are you?

100
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,949
Getting to know everybody
for the first time

101
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,268
and just trying to figure
out everyone's relationships

102
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:12,157
- and their characters.
- Hey! What's your name?

103
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,893
Jack!

104
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,812
It looked like a movie to me.
If this was gonna be something,

105
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,557
that hadn't been done before, in terms of

106
00:05:18,677 --> 00:05:22,421
network prime time TV, it
was a brilliant way to start.

107
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,414
- You'd think they would've come by now.
- I thought it was extraordinary.

108
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,005
- Who?
- Anyone.

109
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,437
I was blown away by it.

110
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,532
- Did anybody see that?
- Yeah.

111
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,180
All of us as a cast were
really excited about it

112
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,845
and really proud of what we'd done.

113
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,733
We felt like we had accomplished
was something special.

114
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,933
Terrific.

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,645
The show's ambitious production
style immediately set it apart.

116
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,805
When Jack, Kate and Charlie
went to find the cockpit...

117
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:02,582
that was the first stuff we ever
filmed when we got to Hawaii.

118
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:08,973
- You never heard that song?
- I've heard it. I just don't
know what the hell it has...

119
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,381
That's us. Drive Shaft.

120
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,990
- Look, the ring. Second tour of Finland.
- What?

121
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:13,852
We gotta keep moving.

122
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:18,701
And to see that come to
life was pretty impressive.

123
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,029
Aah!

124
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:21,781
Aah! Oh, my God!

125
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:22,989
Aah!

126
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:27,205
There was a camera in
front of us bouncing around,

127
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,141
and we were bouncing around
and looking terrified,

128
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,900
but we're really just basically
on a self-propelled treadmill,

129
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:34,436
and that kind of stuff, you... you do it

130
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,900
and you feel ridiculous doing it
and then you see it come to life

131
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,205
and you realize how impressive it looks.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,661
That was all shot under water towers,
which are basically fire hoses.

133
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:47,909
It's unbelievable how far
your temperature drops.

134
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:51,590
All of that trembling in
terror? No acting involved.

135
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:52,852
I was just freezing.

136
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:54,718
Jack!

137
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,013
A lot of the casting came out of, like,

138
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,109
finding actors they wanted to work with,

139
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,285
rather than necessarily fill in a role.

140
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:05,604
- I'm sick of this redneck!
- You want some more of me, boy?!

141
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,885
Hey! We're all in this together, man.

142
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:10,276
- Let's treat each other with a little respect.
- Shut up, Lardo.

143
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,846
First it was just, wow,
I hope I'm on the level

144
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,917
and I don't get fired 'cause
they're all wonderful actors.

145
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,061
Knowing that we were
all gonna basically...

146
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,550
Drop everything and move to Hawaii

147
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,421
and have to live together
on an island, literally,

148
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,949
they wanted to find people

149
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,845
who seemed to have good
chemistry with each other

150
00:07:26,957 --> 00:07:29,988
on and offscreen. You're okay. I like you.

151
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:33,197
You're okay, too.

152
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,886
I grew to have such an appreciation

153
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:37,437
for the diversity in...
in these characters

154
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:42,277
because it really added
such perspective to the show,

155
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:45,869
and I feel like made it a show
that the world could relate to.

156
00:07:46,094 --> 00:07:48,509
There! Right there! That's a kick!

157
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:49,820
He.

158
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,716
Never before had a seen a cast
that was truly international,

159
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:55,477
both in reality of the actors

160
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:58,149
who were playing the characters
and the characters themselves.

161
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,333
We had people flown in
from all over the world.

162
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:04,949
I had just come in from Korea,
Naveen Andrews from the U.K.

163
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,237
And Dominic, of course.
Emilie from Australia

164
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:10,517
and Evangeline Lilly from
Canada. It was beautiful.

165
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:13,485
I felt like we were changing
the face of American television.

166
00:08:13,645 --> 00:08:16,676
Fine! I'm the criminal.
You're the terrorist.

167
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,852
We can all play a part. Who you wanna be?

168
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,317
We were all just kind of
crossing our fingers...

169
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,117
"I hope... I hope they like it."

170
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,117
I thought, this is going
to either be a huge success,

171
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:29,045
or we're gonna go down in flames.

172
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,741
So it wasn't until the day
after that the pilot premiered

173
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,541
- I knew that I was gonna
be doing "Lost" for quite a while.
- Is it working?

174
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:38,597
Seems to be, except we're
not picking up a signal.

175
00:08:38,749 --> 00:08:40,573
There is one thing we could try...

176
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,597
seeing if we can get the
signal from high ground.

177
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:44,597
I figured that they would
have to give it a shot

178
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,381
because they seemed to
have gone to so much effort

179
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:49,269
- to produce the first one.
- However many million people

180
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:51,429
watched it for three
weeks in a row, I thought,

181
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:55,766
oh, this... this looks like it
might do all right for a while.

182
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,732
- Go! Go!
- Sawyer!

183
00:08:57,997 --> 00:09:00,700
It was clear "Lost" was no
ordinary tale of survival,

184
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,014
and this was only the beginning.

185
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:06,934
It was kinda overnight...

186
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:10,196
Guys, this isn't just a
bear. It's a polar bear.

187
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,900
I was coming from the gym, all sweaty,

188
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:16,958
and some girls went by and
went, "oh, it's... ew! Ew!"

189
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,620
And I'm like, "ew?"

190
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,805
Wow, I guess I can't
go out in public, like,

191
00:09:20,988 --> 00:09:22,829
fresh from the gym anymore.

192
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,101
You know, you have to be presentable.

193
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,350
Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday!

194
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,558
It's rare for something
to be critically acclaimed

195
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,142
and, uh, I guess, acclaimed by the public.

196
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:37,148
It's a distress call.

197
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,470
I think it was at that
point that I thought,

198
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:40,668
well, this is turning into something

199
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:43,310
that, uh, I couldn't
really have predicted.

200
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:47,812
It's been playing over
and over for 16 years.

201
00:09:49,142 --> 00:09:50,245
Guys...

202
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,605
Where are we?

203
00:09:54,854 --> 00:09:59,306
- So, your husband... was he on the flight?
- Oh, no, I'm not married.

204
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:03,218
Who needs men, right? Bloody useless.

205
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:07,162
"Lost" is, at its heart
and soul, a character study.

206
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,530
We're fascinated, as storytellers,

207
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:12,401
by what makes people the way they are.

208
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,392
On the whole, season 1 was my favorite,

209
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,634
where we started to learn
about these characters

210
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,994
and we started to care
about these characters.

211
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,866
They were these mysteries
that were unsolved

212
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:24,618
and they were tantalizing
because there were no answers.

213
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:25,994
The title "Lost" was really about

214
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:28,210
how these characters were sort
of lost in their own lives.

215
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,841
And for us, the real mystery of the show

216
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,265
wasn't, you know, "where is this island?"

217
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:34,473
But the mystery of the show
was, "who are these people?"

218
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,921
And the first character
audiences were introduced to

219
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,825
was Dr. Jack Shephard.

220
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:43,825
These characters amidst this plane crash

221
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,153
see this man and sort of activated

222
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:50,498
- by his desire to save people.
- Listen to me.

223
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,689
Look at me. You're gonna be
okay. Do you understand me?

224
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,338
But you have to sit absolutely still.

225
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,882
He is elected as the leader a bit,

226
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:01,882
and he's really reticent and
doesn't feel equipped to do that

227
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:05,121
- because of all of his issues with his father.
- What are you talking about?

228
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,281
I'm talking about you stitching up the sac

229
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:09,977
so this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

230
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,858
Jack lived in the shadow
of his father, Christian...

231
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:15,417
I know you don't believe
in me, but I need them to.

232
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:19,440
Are you sure I'm the one who
doesn't believe in you, Jack?

233
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,793
Although Christian died in Sydney...

234
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:25,010
That's him.

235
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:27,961
Jack's issues with his father
followed him to the island.

236
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:33,658
Dad?

237
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,217
It's very rare that you would
get an opportunity to play

238
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:42,139
a character over a 6-year
arc that has had such an arc.

239
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:45,002
- I'm not a leader.
- And yet, they all treat you like one.

240
00:11:45,177 --> 00:11:46,809
The experience of playing this guy

241
00:11:46,897 --> 00:11:48,905
and going through what
he's had to go through

242
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,225
and trying to tell his story
the very best that I can

243
00:11:51,346 --> 00:11:54,585
- has been great. It's been an amazing experience.
- Excuse me!

244
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,354
Do you have a second? I
could use a little help here.

245
00:11:58,353 --> 00:11:59,873
Look, I'd do it myself. I'm a doctor.

246
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,922
- But I just can't reach it.
- You want me to sew that up?

247
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,793
- If you wouldn't mind.
- Of course I will.

248
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,768
Thank you.

249
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,257
Hey, girl.

250
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,985
Kate Austen appeared to
be the girl next door,

251
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:16,042
but she was running from a turbulent past.

252
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,977
You are beautiful.

253
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,178
After killing her abusive stepfather...

254
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,194
Katherine... what did you do?

255
00:12:25,017 --> 00:12:26,428
I took care of you, ma.

256
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:28,537
Kate became a fugitive.

257
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:30,546
Kate's flaws were her...

258
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,601
as with most people, I think...
her greatest strengths as well.

259
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,122
Her spontaneity was
killing her all the time.

260
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,050
I mean, she didn't think before
she moved. She just acted.

261
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,152
Don't run, Kate.

262
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,177
Uhh! Uhh!

263
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Kate was a murderer, and
it's very odd to see people

264
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,954
get behind a murderer as
much as they got behind Kate.

265
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:50,498
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

266
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,737
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

267
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:58,458
She really cared about
people on a deep, deep level,

268
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,825
so much so that she couldn't help herself

269
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,112
from acting out... sometimes stupidly.

270
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:08,122
She was following you.
Like I said... curiosity.

271
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:11,265
But they were always driven
by this really big heart

272
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,626
that she has that just
desperately wanted to see

273
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,769
things be right and good. I
was just trying to help, Jack.

274
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,561
And I think that people
sympathize with that.

275
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:22,249
I wanna tell you what I did.

276
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:25,882
It doesn't matter, Kate.

277
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,674
We should all be able to start over.

278
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,025
And I think that's what
makes you love her, too.

279
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:34,025
What do you want for the inhalers?

280
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:37,817
- What do I want? A kiss oughta do it.
- What?

281
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:39,105
A kiss.

282
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,937
From you, right now.

283
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,817
Nice, huh?!

284
00:13:45,266 --> 00:13:47,842
- For me I would love to be Sawyer because...
- Shocker!

285
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,657
Well... "because I'm
in love with Sawyer..."

286
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,113
"And I like to take off my shirt

287
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:55,202
- and look at myself in the mirror."
- How about you come a
little closer and warm me up?

288
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:58,505
- You sure know how to
make a girl feel special, Sawyer.
- Sawyer is so fun.

289
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:01,474
I mean, he's the handsome rogue.
He's dangerous. He's clever.

290
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:03,377
- He quips.
- There's some good ones.

291
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:05,729
You sure know how to
butter a man up, stay puft.

292
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:06,609
It's a gift.

293
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,369
I loved "stay puft."

294
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:11,961
I thought that was kinda funny
in the first season with Jorge,

295
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,513
and then "Mr. Clean."

296
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,402
All you need's an earring and a mop.

297
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:18,065
I think that perfectly describes Terry.

298
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,233
Lapidus...

299
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:21,178
- Hey, Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.

300
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:22,721
What's your problem, Jumbotron?

301
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:26,273
Shut up... redneck... man.

302
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,537
Touché.

303
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:31,129
It would be a lot of fun to
call Hurley nicknames and, uh...

304
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,129
- say "son of a bitch" all the time?
- And say "son of a bitch",
"son of a bitch" all the time.

305
00:14:34,201 --> 00:14:36,065
- Go ahead. Give it a shot.
- Son of a bitch.

306
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,673
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

307
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:41,713
It's good. Now take your shirt off.

308
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,929
It's a lot of fun to
play a salty character

309
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,905
but that has a sense of humor.

310
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:48,657
But I was worried about his survival

311
00:14:49,242 --> 00:14:51,361
- because he was so hard.
- Shut up!

312
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:56,312
You wanna know what kind of
human being I am? Read it.

313
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:57,930
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,

314
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:01,058
you don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

315
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:02,985
and I know what you done."

316
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:06,361
Get under the bed. Don't make a sound.

317
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,138
- Open this door!
- As a young boy...

318
00:15:08,305 --> 00:15:11,266
James Ford witnessed his
parents' murder/suicide...

319
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,786
What are you doing? !
What the hell are you...

320
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,754
Brought on when a man called Sawyer

321
00:15:14,882 --> 00:15:16,201
made off with everything they had.

322
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,754
Revenge became his life's purpose,

323
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,649
and he took on the identity
of the man he sought.

324
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:25,986
This letter wasn't written
to you. You wrote this letter.

325
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:29,466
I think that was a major
moment, him being found out...

326
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,834
you know, what his kind
of dark secret is...

327
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,352
really put a chink in his armor and...

328
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:39,617
Allowed his humanity to seep out of that.

329
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:45,409
- I think you've never actually
tortured anybody in your life.
- Unfortunately for us both...

330
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,409
you're wrong.

331
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,401
I was a military communications officer.

332
00:15:50,537 --> 00:15:51,666
I fought in the Gulf war.

333
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,818
What were you... Air Force, Army?

334
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,298
The Republican Guard.

335
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:59,616
Sayid Jarrah battled with a dark past.

336
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,001
I guess you have a new
skill set you can use.

337
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,793
It immediately spikes your interest,

338
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:05,736
and then you think, you
know, is this a gimmick?

339
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:08,241
Why are they doing this? Is this
person gonna be a human being,

340
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:09,817
as opposed to some kind of symbol

341
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,058
or something, uh, shall
we say, less attractive?

342
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,665
Noor Abed Jazeem.

343
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,178
I'm going to ask you some questions.

344
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:20,753
Nobody calls me "Noor," Sayid.

345
00:16:20,873 --> 00:16:23,905
What was unusual was that
this character was a romantic.

346
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,201
This isn't a game, Nadia.

347
00:16:26,474 --> 00:16:28,450
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

348
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,980
Somewhere, there's this
part of him that is pure

349
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:34,809
that will allow him to find
some kind of redemption.

350
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,545
One of the greatest things about this show

351
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:40,522
is that the writers were smart enough

352
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,234
to show us a stereotype and
then flip it on its head.

353
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:46,857
- Last week, most of us were strangers.
- People of different countries,

354
00:16:46,993 --> 00:16:49,609
of different races, of,
obviously, different genders,

355
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:52,657
are trying to figure out
how to build a society.

356
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:54,129
But we're all here now.

357
00:16:54,241 --> 00:16:56,001
And God knows how long
we're gonna be here.

358
00:16:56,121 --> 00:17:00,410
At its core, it still is a
story that asks the question,

359
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,777
can we all get along?

360
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:03,954
But if we can't live together...

361
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:09,089
We're gonna die alone.

362
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:19,818
The island held many
mysteries, none more significant

363
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,753
than the monster that
lurked in the jungle.

364
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,898
There it is again.

365
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,850
But there was one survivor
who embraced the island

366
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:31,921
and explored it with renewed faith.

367
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,330
Walt, do you wanna know a secret?

368
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:39,122
Finding out that Locke was
in a wheelchair was huge.

369
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:41,729
Well, I didn't know in the
first episode or two that we shot

370
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,753
that Locke, in fact,
had been in a wheelchair.

371
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,098
- John.
- Before the crash, John Locke had suffered

372
00:17:48,257 --> 00:17:50,634
a paralyzing fall at
the hands of his father.

373
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,001
Oh! Aah!

374
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,849
The incident left him a broken man

375
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,506
searching for purpose.

376
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,498
The John Locke that got on the airplane

377
00:17:58,658 --> 00:18:01,145
just lived in dreams,
and he had nothing else,

378
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:03,162
and I think he was
almost an invisible man.

379
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:07,065
When I saw the scene
when Locke stands up...

380
00:18:07,226 --> 00:18:10,122
And it was very moving and...
that, to me, told me something

381
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:12,410
about the possibilities
for the show. It sort of...

382
00:18:12,554 --> 00:18:15,018
my vision went from here to
here, you know, just like that.

383
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,481
There are plenty of things on this island

384
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:17,841
we can use for sustenance.

385
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:21,041
And exactly how are we
gonna find this sustenance?

386
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,019
- We hunt.
- And all of a sudden,

387
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:26,876
the possibility was presented
to him that he could be somebody,

388
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:29,268
that he could influence
the outcome of events,

389
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:31,115
and that people would
actually listen to him.

390
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,987
That was hugely seductive.

391
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:35,580
I've looked into the eye of this island,

392
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:40,028
- and what I saw was beautiful.
- I never heard the voice that said,

393
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:41,292
"this is the eye of the island,

394
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,492
and you're looking into it, John."

395
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,338
But he interpreted it as
having a special relationship

396
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,108
with the island. He made that.

397
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,956
We were brought here for
a purpose, for a reason...

398
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,996
- all of us.
- And who brought us here, John?

399
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:56,466
- The island.
- I always had a sense, you
know, that that was gonna be

400
00:18:56,627 --> 00:19:00,516
a fundamental battle in the
show was the Jack/Locke dynamic.

401
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,540
I think that's why you and I don't
see eye to eye sometimes, Jack,

402
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,188
- because you're a man of science.
- What does that make you?

403
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,748
I'm a man of faith.
- It was easy for me to relate to all these aspects of Locke.

404
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,292
I just wanted to stay on the
island, live in the woods,

405
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:15,090
- give people good advice.
- It's my birthday today.

406
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,635
At least your birthdays
will be close together,

407
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,483
- you and your baby, and that's good luck.
- You believe in that?

408
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,139
I believe in a lot of things.

409
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:25,971
Happy birthday, Claire.

410
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,524
Thank you.

411
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,876
So... first plane crash?

412
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:34,404
- What gave it away?
- Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

413
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,364
Claire Littleton was alone
at the time of the crash

414
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,653
but found a friend in Charlie Pace.

415
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,076
They had a very interesting relationship.

416
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,836
So many moments were so sweet,
like the peanut butter jar.

417
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,475
Peanut butter?!

418
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:49,653
Just like you ordered.

419
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,179
Thank God it was fake peanut
butter 'cause I'm terribly allergic.

420
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:55,043
So I'm reading that. I'm like, oh, great!

421
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:58,956
- The one thing I can't eat, they got me.
- Extra smooth.

422
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,883
It's the best bloody peanut
butter I've ever tasted.

423
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,403
She's a very sweet,
doesn't-hold-grudges kind of girl

424
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:09,099
but has this just incredible
sort of inner strength,

425
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,628
having to deal with being pregnant

426
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,363
and having a child in not the
comfiest location for that to happen,

427
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,708
I would imagine.

428
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,060
Claire? What are you doing out here?

429
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:21,779
Nothing. Just leave me alone, please.

430
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,780
One of the episodes that I
walked away from and thought,

431
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:29,372
holy crap, that was so... boop... good,

432
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,259
was the episode where Boone dies

433
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:33,387
and little baby Aaron is born.

434
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,179
Ready? Come on. One more.

435
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,948
Push! Push! Push, push, push, push!

436
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,404
You know, the death and the birth

437
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:51,388
and the falling away of one thing

438
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:53,051
to give life to a new thing...

439
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:56,124
it was just executed so dramatically.

440
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,020
That was a really special episode.

441
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,331
And Charlie has become

442
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,364
sort of the surrogate father
for the child. The three of them

443
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:05,652
kinda comprised the closest
thing to a nuclear family

444
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:08,996
- that exists on "Lost."
- I love you.

445
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,259
What are we looking for again?

446
00:21:11,676 --> 00:21:14,044
Uh, any long piece of
metal or plastic tubing.

447
00:21:14,412 --> 00:21:16,156
Anything that looks like,
uh, it'll work as a frame.

448
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,635
The first really profound
moment of the show

449
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,116
was at the end of the first season

450
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,540
- when we had the raft launch.
- Oh, I thought it was pretty great.

451
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,875
You know, pretty seaworthy. I
mean, it looked... it was a raft.

452
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:28,196
Those guys made it out of
materials that they found

453
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,236
and could have been on the island.

454
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,876
It was, uh, actually more stable

455
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:36,547
- than the camera boat.
- It's coming together fast.

456
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:39,179
The raft was this real
measure of hope for the show...

457
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,547
the idea that they could
actually get off the island.

458
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,460
I felt like it was a
culmination of all the work

459
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,332
that people had put in
for a very difficult year,

460
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:57,850
and I felt like it was a celebration

461
00:21:58,036 --> 00:22:01,675
of where the show started
from and where it had come.

462
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:07,540
Lift! And keep it straight!

463
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:08,820
It's one of those moments
where you really understand

464
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:12,275
the making of a television series

465
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,275
- is an incredibly collaborative effort.
- Go! Go! Go!

466
00:22:12,883 --> 00:22:16,596
- Bye, Vincent! Bye, Vincent!
- It's about literally 300
people doing something in unison.

467
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,532
You know, we had written the
scene, but then you see the film

468
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:26,620
and you see the way Jack
bender executed the scene,

469
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,332
and then you see the emotion
that all the actors brought.

470
00:22:29,533 --> 00:22:31,595
Ah! What'd I tell you, huh?

471
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,732
And then on top of that,
we went to the scoring stage

472
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,228
with Michael Giacchino, and
the cue was so beautiful,

473
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:40,763
that when it was over,
everybody was crying

474
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:43,363
because it was playing and the images
of the raft launch were going on,

475
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:45,268
and they all started tapping their bows

476
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,347
against their instruments and clapping,

477
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:49,892
and it was just this
profound emotional moment.

478
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:51,995
To see the magic of television

479
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,731
make that into a scene that
became as epic as it was...

480
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:58,035
Yeah. You know, it's almost mythological.

481
00:22:58,147 --> 00:22:59,964
It's almost like homer
taking off on his odyssey.

482
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,124
It's a heroic journey,

483
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:04,139
- and it was awe-inspiring for me. Literally awesome.
- Yeah.

484
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,365
The story of "Lost"
required a unique backdrop

485
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:17,837
where its dramatic tale of
survival and mystery could unfold.

486
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,349
The island of Oahu in Hawaii
proved to be the ultimate location.

487
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:24,740
When I got this job, I said,
"honey, we're going to Hawaii."

488
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:26,460
And she went, "where is
that? " We looked on the map.

489
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,973
And we looked at the Pacific
and thought, jeez, that's it?

490
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:32,565
- That's in the middle of nowhere.
- Hawaii's been amazing.

491
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:35,452
It's the perfect,
perfect set for our show.

492
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,165
- That's your island.
- I've really enjoyed that.

493
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:41,372
- So much of the show is shot outdoors.
- It has incredible mountains.

494
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,963
The weather can be
beautiful, but it can turn.

495
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:47,372
- You can have incredible rain.
- Storm's about to pass, Hugo.

496
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,285
The sea can be treacherous.

497
00:23:49,476 --> 00:23:52,533
It can be really, really tough.
You're in mud up to your ankles,

498
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:55,141
or you just spend a
ton of time in the sun.

499
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,573
And, you know, the crew has
just been absolutely amazing.

500
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,164
I mean, there have been
days where I just don't know

501
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:01,765
how the equipment gets in and
how the equipment gets out.

502
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:06,558
- It's not easy, but it's worth it.
- Beautiful, isn't it? No matter
how much time you spend

503
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:08,332
on the island, you just
never get tired of this view.

504
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,132
This landscape is a character in the show.

505
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,164
I don't know when I'll ever work

506
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:17,620
in as magical an environment
as I have done here on Oahu.

507
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:22,124
In 121 hours of the
series, all but 4 scenes

508
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:23,989
were shot in the Hawaiian Islands.

509
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,540
Just looking back, I think
we did pretty good job

510
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:28,646
being sort of all over the world

511
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:30,742
and shooting everything
right here in Hawaii.

512
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,268
- Is this your first time in Tunisia?
- No.

513
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,980
From the acting point of view,
that kind of production design

514
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,428
- is like, to me, 75% of the battle.
- Welcome to Iowa.

515
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,933
And the fact that they manage
to do it here, you know,

516
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:47,212
in downtown Honolulu, to create
Germany, eastern Europe...

517
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:50,676
The mind boggles. It was very daring

518
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,061
to allow characters to
move between those worlds.

519
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,820
In the history of American television,

520
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,221
we've never had a television show

521
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,388
with half of 42, you know,
minutes being subtitled.

522
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,900
Every Korean person understands
some words of English.

523
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:16,197
Ow! Ow!

524
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,629
I stepped on a friggin' urchin!

525
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:21,701
You know, my task, when I
was listening, was to pinpoint

526
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,917
the words that I thought
that Jin would understand.

527
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,525
You're gonna have to pee on my foot, man.

528
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:27,485
Just pee! Pee on it!

529
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,373
- No! No!
- Pee on...

530
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,541
So that he could hook onto those words

531
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:36,085
and give him the appetite
to stay in the conversation.

532
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:39,005
I guess that falls under the category

533
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:40,454
of "be careful what you wish for."

534
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,453
You understood me.

535
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,717
You did, didn't you? You
just understood what I said.

536
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,165
Sun was this mysterious,

537
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:54,243
very traditional, um...
even submissive at times,

538
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,203
um, who was sort of trapped
in a horrible marriage.

539
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:05,813
This guy was really mean to
his wife. He only spoke Korean

540
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,317
and just was not a very
pleasant guy to be around.

541
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:10,796
And I thought, well, I don't
know if I wanna do this.

542
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:13,237
I'm so glad I did.

543
00:26:13,597 --> 00:26:15,340
It's been so much fun playing her...

544
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:19,292
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong is I'm married.

545
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:23,221
And keeping up with her
and all of her secrets.

546
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,580
Despite language barriers
and marital strife,

547
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:28,237
life on the island
brought Sun and Jin closer

548
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,388
and offered them hope for a new chapter.

549
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,701
You're pregnant.

550
00:26:35,573 --> 00:26:38,109
Is the baby... mine?

551
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,924
His evolution has been pretty
marked and pretty significant.

552
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,517
Whether they were happy or unhappy,

553
00:26:56,653 --> 00:27:00,668
it was the love story that I
think a lot of people cared about.

554
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,564
It was almost comical for a little while.

555
00:27:02,693 --> 00:27:05,469
You know, every possible obstacle
you could throw in the way

556
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:08,684
- of two people getting back together.
- You don't want him to go, do you?

557
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:09,916
No.

558
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:12,212
We were gonna be islands apart,

559
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:15,020
and then we were gonna be
literally decades apart.

560
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:19,549
Having Sun and Jin be
apart for a good two seasons

561
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:22,198
not only in space but time,

562
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,468
I think it really drew the... the viewers

563
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,349
to root for them to get back together

564
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,669
and have a happy ending.

565
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:31,229
They had a lot of faith in
each other and themselves

566
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:35,309
- to keep searching.
- But Sun and Jin were not the only survivors

567
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:36,972
to find themselves separated.

568
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:40,589
At the end of... almost every season,

569
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,893
they would split up the tribe somehow.

570
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:46,797
- If you wanna live, you need to come with me.
- I guess our first big split

571
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:49,253
was some people were
gonna live in the caves

572
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:50,757
and some people were
gonna stay on the beach.

573
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,542
And then "Exodus, " some
people go off on a boat,

574
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:57,532
and some of us go marching
to " the black rock."

575
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:00,181
And for a long time, at
the beginning of season 2,

576
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,365
it was like we were working
on two different shows.

577
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:06,204
And then eventually, you know, they rejoined
us and then we're back together again.

578
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:08,372
Like our characters on the show,

579
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:11,620
we were, uh, we were brought
here from all over the world

580
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:14,164
to this beautiful Hawaii island, and...

581
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:15,454
We became best of friends

582
00:28:15,572 --> 00:28:17,821
because we were sailing
on this ship together

583
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,805
and it was doing well, and...
and we were just getting

584
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:22,757
to know each other. As
our relationships deepened,

585
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,796
- I felt like we became family.
- Those closing montages

586
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:27,628
that we had a lot where you just kind of

587
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:31,412
pan across everybody, and
Sayid throwing the apple,

588
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,741
and I'm shaking sand out of my shoes...

589
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:36,836
those are nice "I love
these guys" kind of moments.

590
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:47,246
I'm probably most intrigued by faith.

591
00:28:47,438 --> 00:28:50,621
I like being on a show that just
talks about faith as a general idea,

592
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,245
about just really, really
believing in something,

593
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:58,678
about having heart enough to
step forward physically in faith.

594
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:00,726
Why do you find it so hard to believe?

595
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,726
- Why do you find it so easy?!
- It's never been easy!

596
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,518
I mean, Locke said, "I'm a man of faith.

597
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:06,766
You're a man of science." I always thought

598
00:29:06,885 --> 00:29:09,262
he was a man that was
desperately seeking faith,

599
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:12,782
not that he had faith.

600
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:16,317
I mean, I think what drove
him was the need for it.

601
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,373
If he could simply find
something to connect to,

602
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:21,462
something to hold on to, and I think
that's what he was always after.

603
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:25,037
Locke's desire for connection
was never more evident

604
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,343
than when he found a hatch in the ground

605
00:29:26,966 --> 00:29:28,559
and believed it held all the answers.

606
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,038
I've done everything you wanted me to do.

607
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,718
So why did you do this?! Why?!

608
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:38,814
When the lightbulb went on in the hatch,

609
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,406
I mean, I just thought that
was brilliant, actually.

610
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,486
You know, you had this whole buildup

611
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,870
as to, "what is this hatch?
" And then a lightbulb goes on

612
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:48,094
and somebody walking around down there.

613
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:48,998
Who is that man?

614
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:54,846
It was a man Jack met years
before the Oceanic crash.

615
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:55,646
Jack.

616
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:57,693
I'm Desmond.

617
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:01,102
Good luck, brother. See
you in another life, yeah?

618
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:03,485
When I first worked on "Lost,"

619
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,494
I didn't really know
anything about the show.

620
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:07,166
And they gave me some episodes to watch,

621
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,028
and I realized that I was
gonna be the man in the hatch.

622
00:30:09,493 --> 00:30:12,909
Lower your gun, or I'll blow
his damned head off, brother!

623
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:17,022
But I didn't really realize
how big it was gonna be.

624
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:18,430
You?

625
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,942
The show had sort of
taken off around the world.

626
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:24,542
- You're gonna take his word for it?
- His word is all we have, Jack.

627
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:26,846
You don't have to take my word for it.

628
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,134
Watch the film.

629
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:32,829
the hatch was one of
many research stations

630
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,117
built by the Dharma initiative,
a group of scientists

631
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,215
who came to the island in the 1970s

632
00:30:38,414 --> 00:30:41,766
- to study its unique properties....
- Unique electromagnetic fluctuations.

633
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:44,174
Desmond was charged with pushing a button

634
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,735
every 108 minutes to keep a massive amount

635
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:49,350
of electromagnetic energy contained.

636
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:52,550
You don't really see very much of him.

637
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,094
You know, you don't know
everything about him,

638
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:56,542
which always makes him
more attractive, I think.

639
00:30:56,837 --> 00:30:59,710
Desmond's a very, uh, a
very interesting character

640
00:30:59,877 --> 00:31:03,125
within the world of "Lost.
" I mean, he's the constant.

641
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,431
Desmond was also the reason
for the Oceanic crash.

642
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,333
He neglected to enter
the code in the computer

643
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:12,718
just as Flight 815 was
passing over the island.

644
00:31:14,014 --> 00:31:16,005
So when Locke chose to
stop pushing the button,

645
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,358
- Desmond knew the situation was serious.
- You killed us all.

646
00:31:20,518 --> 00:31:21,381
What I like about Desmond

647
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:25,190
is that he always seems
to be doing the best he can

648
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:26,838
to do what he thinks is the right thing.

649
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:31,861
Desmond turned a fail-safe
key to destroy the hatch...

650
00:31:31,982 --> 00:31:33,662
And prevent a global catastrophe.

651
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:38,510
- He survived the ordeal.
- Whoa, dude.

652
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:40,567
I woke up in the jungle like this.

653
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:44,358
Like, the hatch...
blew off your underwear?

654
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,262
Yeah, it was a lot of fun
working in those early days,

655
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,878
- and we've come a long way
with the character of Desmond.
- Hey! Over here!

656
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:56,093
The survivors soon met
another man in the jungle.

657
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:59,677
My name is Henry Gale! I'm from Minnesota!

658
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:03,182
The original deal for Henry
Gale was to be three episodes.

659
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,821
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

660
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:07,278
- She believes he's an Other.
- An other what?

661
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:11,014
This mysterious man was presumed
to be one of the Others...

662
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:13,214
the island's original inhabitants

663
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,054
who often clashed with
the Oceanic survivors.

664
00:32:16,974 --> 00:32:19,382
You don't always know
exactly how to play a role

665
00:32:19,621 --> 00:32:21,325
when you come in as a guest player...

666
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:22,750
Of course, if I was one of them...

667
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:28,061
- these people that you seem
to think are your enemies...
- But this one I had an instinct for.

668
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,798
I knew kind of what to do
with it right off the bat.

669
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:33,334
I'd drawn 'em out to
a real secluded place.

670
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:35,599
And when your friends got
there, a bunch of my people

671
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,678
would be waiting for 'em, and then
they'd use them to trade for me.

672
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,613
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

673
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:46,878
You guys got any milk?

674
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:49,798
As it turned out, Henry was one of them,

675
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:54,493
my name is Benjamin Linus, and I've
lived on this island all my life.

676
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,382
Benjamin Linus was the
leader of the Others,

677
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:01,621
and he would do anything in
his power to protect the island.

678
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:06,774
Well, what's fun to play with
Benjamin Linus is the uncertain middle.

679
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,775
You're not gonna shake?

680
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:11,614
I get to be a... a vulnerable character.

681
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,606
Tom, unless you hear my voice in
one minute, shoot all three of them.

682
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:21,414
But I also get to be sometimes
quite ruthless and cold.

683
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:23,574
I'm so sorry, Jack.

684
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:32,926
I'd always thought that Ben
used taking a beating as a tool

685
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:37,118
to gain information about the
people that were beating him.

686
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,949
- Did you lose someone?
- You know what I lost!

687
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:42,373
I would venture to say that
I am the most beaten character

688
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,702
in the history of television.

689
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:48,173
So that's been a big
part of every working day.

690
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:52,270
I'm so jealous of the
other actors, who, you know,

691
00:33:52,422 --> 00:33:54,998
they put a little sunscreen
on and mess up their hair,

692
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,126
and they're ready for work.

693
00:34:01,301 --> 00:34:03,063
I always have to come in early to get

694
00:34:03,205 --> 00:34:06,911
these cuts and bruises and
wounds and stuff put on me.

695
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,573
In Ben's mind, it was a small price to pay

696
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,126
to get the informational advantage.

697
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,381
Hello again.

698
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:15,365
If he was anything simple at all,

699
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:18,845
the audience would have
tired of him before now.

700
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:21,429
You're gonna take this boat
and follow a compass bearing

701
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:23,846
of 3-2-5, and if you do that exactly,

702
00:34:24,086 --> 00:34:26,558
you and your son will find rescue.

703
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:28,750
- That's it?
- Deal's a deal.

704
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,565
They keep moving him around fractionally
on the scale of good and evil.

705
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:37,638
And just when the audience
thinks they have him pinned down

706
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,127
then the writers change it up.

707
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:40,950
Who are you people?

708
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,390
We're the good guys, Michael.

709
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:52,688
Over the course of six seasons,

710
00:34:52,976 --> 00:34:56,215
"Lost" has garnered millions of
devoted fans around the world...

711
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:58,792
among them, the actors themselves.

712
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,960
I watch "Lost" to be entertained

713
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:02,840
and to be drawn into these people

714
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,286
and their lives and what
they're challenged by.

715
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,680
I have a son who loves this show,

716
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,288
and so we... we watch
it together as a family.

717
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:12,439
I'm a rabid viewer of the show now.

718
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:15,327
Some actors can't look at
the show. I... I have to.

719
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:17,088
Like everybody else, whether
they'll say it or not,

720
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:20,407
- I love watching myself.
- I'm a fan of the show on a lot of levels,

721
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:22,031
kind of a clueless fan.

722
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,064
There are many people at home that have it

723
00:35:24,216 --> 00:35:27,128
- much better figured out than I do.
- There's this expectation

724
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:29,255
that you have to sort of dumb
a show down to the audience.

725
00:35:29,384 --> 00:35:31,648
We kind of went the other
way. We sort of felt like,

726
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:34,984
let's make a show that we would
really appreciate as viewers

727
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:38,000
that tried to be intelligent,
that tried to introduce things

728
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:39,489
that are sort of heavily thematic,

729
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:43,720
based on philosophy or physics. If one
of the writers really loved the teachings

730
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:46,688
of Rousseau or Locke, uh,
why not name characters

731
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,936
- after those philosophers?
- Are you Daniel Faraday?

732
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:50,600
Jeremy Bentham? Anthony Cooper.

733
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:52,839
- Desmond David Hume?
- How'd you know my name?

734
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:56,776
What we do like to do is hide little Easter
eggs in the show for the people who want to

735
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,495
- go down the rabbit hole with
us and look a little bit deeper.
- To kind of get at the source

736
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:01,679
of who these people are,

737
00:36:01,823 --> 00:36:05,119
we looked at a lot of the things
that we had, ourselves, read.

738
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,000
- "Watership Down."
- "The Wizard of Oz."

739
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:08,759
- "Turn of the Screw. "
- "The Looking Glass."

740
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,303
It's "Lord of the Flies" time now.

741
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:13,407
One of Carlton's favorite
authors is Walker Percy.

742
00:36:13,529 --> 00:36:16,495
- Well, we have Sawyer reading Walker Percy.
- How can you read?

743
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:18,024
My mother taught me.

744
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:21,296
A book that is used as a prop...
I kind of want to read it, then,

745
00:36:21,464 --> 00:36:23,615
and it's fun to make connections

746
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:27,511
between things... maybe a kind
of eggheaded fun, but that's me.

747
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:30,008
So whether it was Stephen King, the Bible

748
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:32,128
or the "Star Wars" trilogy...

749
00:36:32,529 --> 00:36:34,415
He turns up whenever he
wants, like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

750
00:36:34,569 --> 00:36:37,048
All of these disparate influences

751
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:39,232
we kind of tried to
bring to bear on the show.

752
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,632
Getting to do those references
when they would show up...

753
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:45,736
- That was like a...
- Was always a blast.

754
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:47,015
Jedi moment.

755
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,416
Hurley would probably be
a fan of the show "Lost."

756
00:36:49,776 --> 00:36:53,936
It would probably be his second
favorite show behind "exposãÂ©."

757
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,423
What the hell's "exposãÂ©"?

758
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,928
Only the most awesome
hour of television ever.

759
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,216
Hurley is kind of a group
cheerleader in a way.

760
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,552
He was about getting the whole group

761
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:07,367
just to make it to
tomorrow. I bet four papayas.

762
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:10,632
Once you get past surviving,
there comes a point

763
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,976
where people are gonna
wanna be entertained somehow,

764
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,976
and I wasn't sure what it'd be,
but I felt like Hurley should

765
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:17,928
do something like put together
a talent show or something.

766
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,048
Then the golf game showed up, so that
works. Dudes, listen, if we're stuck here,

767
00:37:22,192 --> 00:37:24,528
then just surviving's not gonna cut it.

768
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:28,360
We need some way that we can, you
know, have fun. I was told early, like,

769
00:37:28,488 --> 00:37:30,961
"okay, here's what we got for your story.

770
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,783
- It's like, he's a lottery winner."
- ... With the mega number 42.

771
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:38,143
Okay, great, but what's
my "Twilight Zone" thing?

772
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,840
Like, where's my twist that
makes people go "what?!"

773
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:46,743
And I didn't get that till I finally
read the script where the numbers that had

774
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:49,848
ruined his life, essentially,
end up being on that hatch.

775
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:51,711
Stop! The numbers are bad!

776
00:37:51,823 --> 00:37:54,352
And then just popping
up everywhere... clocks,

777
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:57,320
soccer jerseys, the
odometer on the Camaro.

778
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,864
That became kind of a fun
thing just... just everywhere

779
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:01,655
that stuff like that shows up.

780
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,296
Hurley kind of always
had this cloud over him,

781
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,809
and everything bad that happened to Hurley

782
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:11,048
or that... really, that happened
to people around Hurley...

783
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:14,495
he always blamed himself for.
I could really use a victory.

784
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:17,232
Let's get this car started.
Let's make our own luck.

785
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,481
And the Dharma van is kind of
a big turnaround moment for him.

786
00:38:21,688 --> 00:38:24,951
He wasn't gonna let the curse
control his life anymore.

787
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:26,416
- Hurley!
- Make your own luck.

788
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,704
There is no curse!

789
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:30,503
Aah! Aah!

790
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,273
Son of a bitch.

791
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:35,648
- Hurley!
- Whoo!

792
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:37,599
- You know what my favorite scene was together?
- Which one?

793
00:38:37,737 --> 00:38:39,064
The one we're sitting in the van,

794
00:38:39,264 --> 00:38:40,968
- and we've got those beers.
- Oh, yes!

795
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:43,199
And you're teaching me... English.

796
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:44,616
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

797
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,984
- You're teaching me the
important phrases to know.
- Yes, that was epic.

798
00:38:48,168 --> 00:38:50,288
Those... pants...

799
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:53,432
don't make you look... fat.

800
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,529
Only three things a woman needs to hear.

801
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,808
To kind of be able to relax and, you know,

802
00:38:58,912 --> 00:39:02,535
literally lean back and
just have a casual, fun scene

803
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,039
was just really refreshing.

804
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,351
Aah!

805
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,775
What's that?

806
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,479
It's a helicopter.

807
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:15,888
Rescue.

808
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:19,367
Stand back!

809
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:22,696
After 90 days on the island,

810
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:26,008
the survivors made their first
contact with the outside world.

811
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,335
Desmond.

812
00:39:27,528 --> 00:39:31,272
A woman had arrived from a freighter
off the coast of the island.

813
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,608
The boat was allegedly sent by
Desmond's girlfriend, Penny Widmore.

814
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:38,103
But making contact would be difficult.

815
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:40,736
An underwater Dharma station was jamming

816
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,752
all the radio signals from the island.

817
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,247
- The question is, how do we get it to stop?
- I'll do it.

818
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:48,487
For me, the most shocking episode

819
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,822
was the one that dealt
with Charlie's death.

820
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:54,079
Charlie obviously was a
very likeable character.

821
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,672
I'll be fine, Claire.

822
00:39:57,232 --> 00:39:58,600
Don't worry about me.

823
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:06,615
They felt like they'd known
each other a lot longer.

824
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,008
It just evolved into something
that was just perfect,

825
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:11,504
and now, you know, really sad.

826
00:40:13,407 --> 00:40:15,056
Charlie swam to the underwater station

827
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,688
and turned off the jamming signal...

828
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:20,640
Giving his friends a
chance to call for help.

829
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:22,711
This is Penelope Widmore.

830
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:25,529
- How did you get this frequency?
- Desmond!

831
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,528
Did you just say "Desmond"?

832
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,760
- Yeah. Hey, are you on the boat?
- What boat? I'm not on a boat.

833
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:33,367
One of the hardest things for us to do

834
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:38,087
as storytellers on "Lost"
is to kill characters...

835
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,848
- Hello? Is Desmond there?
- Because in many ways,
these characters are friends.

836
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:44,719
Charlie!

837
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:48,303
When we killed off Charlie
in the season 3 finale,

838
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,321
it was something that we deliberated
over for a very long time.

839
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:57,992
How he died was just so
moving, and... and I have to say

840
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:01,783
I was crying my eyes out
when I saw Charlie drown.

841
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:04,263
It really hit home,
because everybody loved him.

842
00:41:04,383 --> 00:41:07,272
It affected everyone a lot more
than we expected maybe, too.

843
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,287
When we actually went
into the editing room,

844
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,455
the moment when Charlie actually dies

845
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,112
was this profoundly upsetting thing.

846
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:18,073
It felt like losing a loved one
even though it was just pretend.

847
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,840
Shh. Aaron.

848
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,800
What is it?

849
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:27,672
- Charlie just got us rescued.
- Hello?

850
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,248
With the signal cleared, the call
for help was finally answered.

851
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:35,168
I'm one of the survivors
of Oceanic Flight 815.

852
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,385
- Can you get a fix on our location?
- Hell, yeah, we can!

853
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:56,094
I burnt my hand on my muffins.

854
00:41:56,214 --> 00:42:02,478
I'm interested in the ways that relativity
is an issue in our show point of view.

855
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:04,989
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

856
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:05,974
Excuse me?

857
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:09,405
Reality presents itself from one angle,

858
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,799
but then if you step to the
side or you pull the lens back,

859
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:15,317
then suddenly you see it differently.

860
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,983
Here I am, thinking that free will

861
00:42:17,254 --> 00:42:20,126
still actually exists on...

862
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,215
Six seasons of "Lost" have taught us

863
00:42:23,325 --> 00:42:26,197
that not everything is what
it initially appears to be.

864
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:29,125
I always to say to people when
they ask me about the show,

865
00:42:29,294 --> 00:42:31,502
what you see is not
necessarily what you get.

866
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:33,462
For the first three seasons,

867
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,286
character flashbacks explored the lives

868
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,693
of the Oceanic survivors

869
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,430
before they crashed on the island.

870
00:42:39,486 --> 00:42:42,334
But everything changed when
Jack, in a time of crisis,

871
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,670
was seen in what was
perceived to be a flashback.

872
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:46,831
It's me.

873
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,430
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

874
00:42:48,574 --> 00:42:50,727
Wait. Don't... don't hang up, please.

875
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:52,678
I just need to see you.

876
00:42:54,374 --> 00:42:55,551
But when Kate appeared,

877
00:42:55,757 --> 00:42:57,901
"Lost" took a giant step to the future

878
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,846
and shattered the expectation

879
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,654
that the survivors would
not leave the island

880
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:03,550
before the end of the series.

881
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:06,887
We... were not supposed to leave.

882
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:08,830
Yes, we were.

883
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:12,070
It was the first in a series
of flash-forward storylines

884
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:14,750
that followed the
experiences of six survivors

885
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:19,693
who found rescue and became
known as the Oceanic Six.

886
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:21,775
"'I wonder if I've been
changed in the night.

887
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,806
Let me think. Was I the same
when I got up this morning?'"

888
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:27,718
Jack and Kate began a life together

889
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:31,766
- raising Claire's son Aaron.
- As an audience, we always got the sense

890
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,359
that they would be good together.

891
00:43:34,134 --> 00:43:36,734
- I'm so glad that you're here.
- That episode with Kate,

892
00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:39,110
we're they're sort of living
in a world where they're in love

893
00:43:39,238 --> 00:43:43,375
- and they're gonna get married...
- Of course I will. Yes.

894
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:45,222
Things seemed to be really beautiful,

895
00:43:45,342 --> 00:43:47,270
but underneath that is
this thing pulling at Jack.

896
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:50,285
It was like the island was
destroying him from afar.

897
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:52,773
I think Jack and Kate
struggled as much as they did

898
00:43:52,886 --> 00:43:55,807
because ultimately Kate was
not Jack's purpose in life,

899
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:58,982
and Jack wasn't Kate's
purpose. You can't do this.

900
00:43:59,214 --> 00:44:00,982
You have problems. You
need to figure them out.

901
00:44:01,382 --> 00:44:03,150
There's nothing more sad and tragic

902
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:04,686
than two people that you really feel

903
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:05,941
would have been great together.

904
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,190
But the circumstances that
they find themselves in

905
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:10,861
doesn't really afford itself
to having the opportunity

906
00:44:10,974 --> 00:44:13,934
to make a really good, pure connection.

907
00:44:14,197 --> 00:44:15,254
And the circumstances that led

908
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:17,758
to Jack and Kate's eventual
departure from the island

909
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:20,886
all began when a chopper
arrived from the freighter.

910
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:24,046
- Who are you?
- I'm Daniel Faraday.

911
00:44:24,383 --> 00:44:26,006
I'm here to rescue you.

912
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,102
Faraday was a physicist
who came to the island

913
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:31,533
with a science team and
their pilot, Frank Lapidus.

914
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:34,630
But rescue was not their primary mission.

915
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,623
This is Charles Widmore... the
man whose boat is parked offshore.

916
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:41,582
Charles Widmore was once
the leader of the Others

917
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:44,422
before he was banished
from the island by Ben.

918
00:44:44,678 --> 00:44:46,215
I'll be seeing you, boy.

919
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,277
Widmore sought vengeance,

920
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:50,470
so he sent the freighter to the island,

921
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:53,894
which also carried a team of
mercenaries to capture Ben.

922
00:44:54,774 --> 00:44:56,766
Let's go, Freckles. I've
seen enough of this rock.

923
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,894
Jack and Sawyer led a group
to Widmore's freighter...

924
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,135
but the chopper began leaking fuel.

925
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:07,589
I'd feel a hell of a lot better if
we were a few hundred pounds lighter!

926
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:08,766
Hey.

927
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:13,829
- So Sawyer made a fateful decision.
- I wonder how much of a relationship

928
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:15,558
Kate and Sawyer were supposed to have.

929
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:19,103
In that pilot when we
did that little gun scene

930
00:45:19,246 --> 00:45:21,902
- and I pulled her in close...
- I've been with girls like you.

931
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:25,063
They were all talking about,
oh, the chemistry there.

932
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:27,014
I don't know if that gave them any ideas

933
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:30,926
or if they had all that planned already. After
all we've been through on this damn island,

934
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:34,598
- don't we deserve somethin' good?
- I always felt, in their flaws,

935
00:45:34,687 --> 00:45:36,142
they were well-matched.

936
00:45:36,246 --> 00:45:38,086
But there is a sort of
sweetness about two people

937
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,294
who know how to stumble together,

938
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:43,557
as opposed to two people
who know how to fly together.

939
00:45:46,054 --> 00:45:46,983
Sawyer!

940
00:45:48,822 --> 00:45:52,173
- How heroic is that for a character?
- That was extremely heroic.

941
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:53,982
A guy that would say, "you
know, we're not gonna make it."

942
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:56,062
- I loved it.
- "I'm jumping." Just like Josh in real life, actually.

943
00:45:56,254 --> 00:46:00,079
It is. I'm... I'm like that. I'm a giver.

944
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,286
Sawyer made his way back to the island,

945
00:46:04,166 --> 00:46:07,414
- where Ben had escaped the mercenaries...
- Thank you for coming, Richard.

946
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,398
And descended into an underground cavern

947
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:12,383
in a final attempt to protect the island.

948
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,534
The chopper reached Widmore's freighter,

949
00:46:15,678 --> 00:46:17,958
but it was rigged with explosives.

950
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,646
Where you going? We gotta
go. Jin's below with Michael.

951
00:46:19,782 --> 00:46:22,197
- No, no, there's no time.
There's no time. We have to go.
- I won't leave him!

952
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:25,448
Every time we get separated,
it is memorable to me

953
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,936
because I often think,
well, maybe this is it.

954
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,127
- No!
- It's Jin!

955
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:33,335
I think it was one of the
hardest scenes I had to shoot.

956
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:43,112
My hands were shaking.

957
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:48,879
We're not! Turn back!

958
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:51,383
Sun! Sun! Jin's gone.

959
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,135
That might be the last
time they see each other,

960
00:46:55,304 --> 00:46:57,495
so it was significant,
and significant for Sun

961
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:59,759
in that she believed that Jin was dead.

962
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:03,520
Lapidus! Fly us back to the island!

963
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:05,304
With the freighter destroyed,

964
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:07,160
the chopper made its way back,

965
00:47:08,272 --> 00:47:10,623
just as Ben Linus turned
a mysterious wheel,

966
00:47:10,768 --> 00:47:12,287
causing the island...

967
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:14,631
to vanish.

968
00:47:15,944 --> 00:47:16,935
Where the hell's the island?!

969
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:18,440
It's gone.

970
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:20,840
That's it, people! We're out of fuel!

971
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,623
- What are you doing here?
- I decided to take a dip.

972
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,928
But I hope "Lost" is mainly remembered

973
00:47:36,032 --> 00:47:37,431
as a character-driven show...

974
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,656
- Whatcha celebratin'?
- I'm not celebrating.

975
00:47:40,897 --> 00:47:43,080
That dealt with human issues...

976
00:47:43,247 --> 00:47:45,704
- Is that our boat?
- It was.

977
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:49,631
That really opened your mind
to different perspectives

978
00:47:49,824 --> 00:47:51,271
that you hadn't thought of before.

979
00:47:51,392 --> 00:47:53,912
I have a sneaking suspicion
that it might stand alone.

980
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,423
I wouldn't be surprised that if
you look back on it, you know,

981
00:47:56,568 --> 00:47:57,768
10, 15, 20 years from now and say,

982
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:02,342
- "that was kind of a one-time thing."
- Hello, John. Welcome home.

983
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:05,423
In terms of creating a
world that you can escape in,

984
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,095
you know, I mean, escapist television...

985
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,752
I don't think it gets
any better than this.

986
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:19,352
Anyone?!

987
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:25,072
When Benjamin Linus turned
the wheel to move the island...

988
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:28,992
He was transported
halfway around the world

989
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,224
to the Tunisian desert,

990
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:33,344
and he began making contact
with the Oceanic Six,

991
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,839
- who had already found rescue.
- Hello, Hugo.

992
00:48:36,032 --> 00:48:39,104
But back on the island,
Locke, Sawyer, Juliet

993
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:40,736
and the remainder of the science team

994
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,744
began flashing through time.

995
00:48:43,072 --> 00:48:45,384
And during one flash...

996
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:47,064
- Jin?
- Sawyer?

997
00:48:47,248 --> 00:48:49,687
They found Jin very much alive.

998
00:48:49,896 --> 00:48:52,215
- We have to go back to the Orchid.
- Excuse me?

999
00:48:52,424 --> 00:48:54,719
That's where all this started.
Maybe it's where it'll all stop.

1000
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,536
So Locke turned the wheel again,

1001
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:01,776
- and the time flashes stopped.
- I think it's over.

1002
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:04,352
- I think John did it.
- Now what?

1003
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:07,927
Now we wait for him to come back.

1004
00:49:08,056 --> 00:49:09,135
After Locke turned the wheel,

1005
00:49:09,272 --> 00:49:12,625
Sawyer and Juliet were
left stranded in 1974.

1006
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,903
And with Jin and Miles, they
joined the Dharma initiative.

1007
00:49:16,249 --> 00:49:19,423
That potato sack of a
jumpsuit was hilarious, man.

1008
00:49:19,545 --> 00:49:22,607
You come put that on every day.
You're like, wow. All right!

1009
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:24,808
And I think Dan had the big sideburns.

1010
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:28,424
I liked it. It was funny
to be '70s, you know?

1011
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:29,263
Evening, Enos.

1012
00:49:29,368 --> 00:49:32,199
Sawyer became head of security,

1013
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:33,839
Juliet was a mechanic...

1014
00:49:34,215 --> 00:49:35,303
Somethin' smells good.

1015
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:38,385
- And the two fell in love.
- Is that for me?

1016
00:49:38,784 --> 00:49:42,975
Whereas Kate and I had three
years to earn that relationship,

1017
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:44,264
they gave us two scenes.

1018
00:49:45,288 --> 00:49:48,191
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1019
00:49:48,456 --> 00:49:50,456
But I watched it, and I was convinced.

1020
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:54,248
I was rooting for Sawyer and
Juliet almost immediately.

1021
00:49:54,384 --> 00:49:55,240
I mean, Sawyer...

1022
00:49:55,352 --> 00:49:57,864
when he was talking to Juliet
at night after the big storm,

1023
00:49:58,032 --> 00:49:59,888
you know, sort of pouring
his heart out about Kate.

1024
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,855
Why don't you tell me now?

1025
00:50:02,272 --> 00:50:04,241
I involuntarily in my head was thinking,

1026
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:07,135
kiss her! Kiss her!

1027
00:50:11,296 --> 00:50:13,488
After turning the wheel,
Locke was transported

1028
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:15,928
3 years in the future to 2007.

1029
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:18,463
He began searching for the Oceanic Six

1030
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:20,664
to convince them to return to the island.

1031
00:50:21,312 --> 00:50:23,312
- I'm not going back.
- The answer is "no."

1032
00:50:23,544 --> 00:50:25,904
- No, I'm not going anywhere with you!
- You leave me alone,

1033
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,976
and you leave the rest of 'em alone!

1034
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:34,343
Locke had failed, and
when he lost all hope...

1035
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:38,024
Wait, please! John, stop.

1036
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:40,328
Benjamin Linus saw a chance

1037
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,567
- to reclaim his role as the leader of the island.
- Who... what... what are you doing here?

1038
00:50:44,752 --> 00:50:47,336
There was a special energy
in the room that day.

1039
00:50:47,496 --> 00:50:49,303
- John, just calm down.
- What do you want from me?

1040
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:51,263
- Please, let me talk.
- Answer the question!

1041
00:50:52,112 --> 00:50:55,536
I always expect Terry
to play a great scene,

1042
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:59,369
but he went somewhere
further and darker that day.

1043
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:00,576
I don't know where we go from there,

1044
00:51:00,712 --> 00:51:03,248
- but we'll figure something out.
- Focus becomes very sharp.

1045
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:06,008
It was an intense and really
fun day for that reason.

1046
00:51:06,215 --> 00:51:10,488
I know where we go. There's
a woman here in Los Angeles...

1047
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,343
- Eloise Hawking.
- Eloise Hawking? You sure?

1048
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:16,888
- Yeah. Why? Do you know her?
- Yes, John. I know her.

1049
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:29,943
I'll miss you, John. I really will.

1050
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,872
I would say it was the
most intense day's work

1051
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:35,352
I ever did in front of the camera.

1052
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:38,055
The news of Locke's death
profoundly affected Jack

1053
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,847
and was the catalyst in his
decision to return to the island.

1054
00:51:42,215 --> 00:51:43,392
There was something happening there

1055
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:45,687
that didn't even have
to do with Jack himself.

1056
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:49,135
It had to do with his
faith... that whole battle

1057
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:52,176
with him and Locke and
what he's meant to do.

1058
00:51:52,504 --> 00:51:55,561
He cannot let go of the
notion that he has free will,

1059
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:57,232
and at the same time, it's destroying him.

1060
00:51:57,383 --> 00:51:59,584
He said that I had to come back.

1061
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:03,049
All of you have to go back.

1062
00:52:04,143 --> 00:52:05,472
We're gonna have to bring him, too.

1063
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,896
Jack and Ben both wanted
to return to the island,

1064
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:12,759
so they found a way.

1065
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,578
Ajira Airways
flight 3-1-6.

1066
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:19,226
The Oceanic Six began their journey back.

1067
00:52:20,202 --> 00:52:23,210
For Kate, it was a chance
to reunite Claire with Aaron.

1068
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,811
Mr. Shephard... your
relation to the deceased?

1069
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:27,682
He was, uh, a friend.

1070
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,834
To recreate the conditions
of the original flight,

1071
00:52:31,034 --> 00:52:33,426
the body of John Locke
was brought on the plane.

1072
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:39,123
High over the pacific...

1073
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,483
A series of flashes
swept through the plane.

1074
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:43,626
Is that a runway? !

1075
00:52:44,907 --> 00:52:46,994
Massive instrument failure!
We're puttin' her down!

1076
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,915
Brace for impact!

1077
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:56,466
Lapidus, Sun and Ben landed on
the island in present day 2007.

1078
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,235
- Frank?
- Where'd they go?

1079
00:52:58,403 --> 00:52:59,266
They're gone.

1080
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:04,443
But Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid...

1081
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:08,419
Returned to the island 30
years earlier in 1977...

1082
00:53:08,681 --> 00:53:12,066
- Jin?
- And were reunited with Jin and Sawyer.

1083
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,171
I can't believe it!

1084
00:53:14,034 --> 00:53:14,650
Ohh!

1085
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,804
So what's up with you guys
in the old Dharma jumpsuits?

1086
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:21,659
We're in the Dharma initiative. It's 1977.

1087
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,929
- Everybody say "namaste."
- Namaste!

1088
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:27,849
Sawyer ushered his friends
into Dharma society.

1089
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,818
And don't forget to
try the dipping sauces.

1090
00:53:29,946 --> 00:53:33,379
- They really bring out the ham.
- Daniel Faraday was also a member

1091
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:35,795
of the 1970s Dharma initiative...

1092
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:37,914
- Hey, James.
- And he spent his days

1093
00:53:38,043 --> 00:53:41,305
trying to find a way to
prevent the crash of Oceanic 815

1094
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:45,226
- from ever happening.
- The Dharma folks at the Swan worksite...

1095
00:53:45,379 --> 00:53:46,578
they're gonna drill into the ground

1096
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:50,427
and accidentally tap into a massive pocket of energy.
- Daniel Faraday says,

1097
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,410
if we can detonate a hydrogen bomb,

1098
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,555
this massive amount of
electromagnetic energy that

1099
00:53:55,675 --> 00:53:59,850
- that hatch is being built to study will be negated.
- And that hatch will never be built,

1100
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:02,763
and your plane will land,
just like it's supposed to.

1101
00:54:03,138 --> 00:54:05,018
His idea inspired Jack.

1102
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,681
And when Faraday was killed...

1103
00:54:07,826 --> 00:54:08,930
Jack carried out the mission.

1104
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:11,427
They think that the bomb
is like a reset button.

1105
00:54:11,555 --> 00:54:14,274
The passengers of Flight 815
will be back on the plane,

1106
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:17,018
they'll be flying to
Los Angeles from Sydney,

1107
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:21,146
and their lives will go on as
though there never was a plane crash.

1108
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:23,650
But the bomb did not detonate...

1109
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,170
This don't look like L.A.X.

1110
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:30,882
- And a surge of electromagnetic energy...
- Uhh!

1111
00:54:31,114 --> 00:54:33,618
- Aah!
- Had Juliet trapped.

1112
00:54:33,722 --> 00:54:35,714
- Juliet! No!
- Aah! Ohh!

1113
00:54:35,866 --> 00:54:37,674
- Where do you think you're going, Blondie?
- Aah!

1114
00:54:37,978 --> 00:54:42,106
That was quite a scene and
a great experience to film.

1115
00:54:42,258 --> 00:54:44,266
- Don't you leave me.
- It's okay.

1116
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,547
Don't you leave me!

1117
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:49,066
Tough stuff, but it
was... it was rewarding.

1118
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,378
I love you, James. I love you so much.
- No!

1119
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:54,947
- No! No, don't let go!
- Aah!

1120
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:56,930
Juliet!

1121
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:01,635
I feel like it rounded out and really
honored that relationship we had

1122
00:55:01,803 --> 00:55:04,331
or the love that we shared as characters.

1123
00:55:07,466 --> 00:55:09,290
Juliet survived the bomb...

1124
00:55:09,675 --> 00:55:11,906
and finished what they'd started.

1125
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:16,618
Come on! Come on!

1126
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:19,371
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1127
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:28,543
The big question as we move into
the final season of the show is,

1128
00:55:28,638 --> 00:55:31,382
what is the consequence of
Juliet tapping that bomb?

1129
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:35,278
So at the beginning of the sixth season,

1130
00:55:35,422 --> 00:55:37,437
we start on Oceanic Flight 815.

1131
00:55:37,631 --> 00:55:41,110
And it appears that the
bomb has actually worked,

1132
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,685
and our passengers are
flying to Los Angeles.

1133
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,229
- Looks like we made it.
- We sure did.

1134
00:55:46,358 --> 00:55:49,223
However, we start to realize
that there are subtle differences

1135
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:52,022
between this group of people
and what we saw initially

1136
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:54,246
- in the pilot of the series.
- You know, you really shouldn't tell people

1137
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:56,566
- you won the lottery.
- Thanks for the advice, dude,

1138
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,438
but nothing bad ever happens to me.

1139
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:02,062
- I'm the luckiest guy alive.
- On "Lost," we've had flashbacks

1140
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:03,830
and then we had flash-forwards,

1141
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:05,343
and now in the final season of the show

1142
00:56:05,454 --> 00:56:07,894
- we have these things called flash sideways.
- Something wrong?

1143
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:11,486
No. No, you just... do
I know you from somewhere?

1144
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:14,069
- Well, I'm not sure.
- For so long,

1145
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,214
these people's stories
have basically been governed

1146
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:18,278
by this idea that the
island is pulling them to it.

1147
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:21,862
We wanted to tell stories for
a very specific reason this year

1148
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:23,838
where the island was not in play.

1149
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,078
This time around, the island has sunk.

1150
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:27,790
It is now on the bottom of the ocean.

1151
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:30,590
And so the passengers of flight 815...

1152
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:32,750
they're flying to Los Angeles from Sydney

1153
00:56:32,886 --> 00:56:34,382
as though there never was a plane crash.

1154
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:37,310
When we actually saw the plane

1155
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:40,446
land safely in "L.A. X.," I was just like,

1156
00:56:40,655 --> 00:56:42,382
it was... it was very emotional.

1157
00:56:43,878 --> 00:56:47,134
Walking off the plane was so significant.

1158
00:56:47,246 --> 00:56:49,070
Wow! They made it.

1159
00:56:50,303 --> 00:56:51,398
And our brains are telling us,

1160
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,150
okay, how did this happen?
Did it happen because

1161
00:56:54,374 --> 00:56:57,151
the A-bomb went off and it
actually sunk the island?

1162
00:56:57,222 --> 00:57:00,438
- Or is there something else going on here?
- Hello?!

1163
00:57:00,574 --> 00:57:02,183
Then shortly after that,

1164
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:04,470
we see our characters are on the island,

1165
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,814
and they've detonated the
bomb, and it didn't work.

1166
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:11,134
- No.
- They get jumped to what we call "island present,"

1167
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,517
- but they are still stuck on the island.
- You blew us right back where we started!

1168
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:18,014
- I'm sorry. I thought it would work.
- Well, it didn't!

1169
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:20,277
So the audience is left
trying to reconcile,

1170
00:57:20,415 --> 00:57:22,199
how is it that we can
be watching one story

1171
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:24,127
in which our characters are on the island

1172
00:57:24,254 --> 00:57:26,902
- and they're in a state of deep misery...
- You did this.

1173
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:29,326
And we're also watching a
story in which our characters

1174
00:57:29,486 --> 00:57:32,054
are landing in Los Angeles,
getting off the plane.

1175
00:57:32,197 --> 00:57:33,526
And so we as an audience are wondering,

1176
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:36,198
- why do these differences exist?
- Thank you so much.

1177
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:39,030
In the sideways timeline,
Jack is a doctor,

1178
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:41,950
- but is also father to a teenage son.
- Good luck, dad.

1179
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:46,358
- Thanks.
- Kate is still a fugitive but claims she is innocent

1180
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,166
- and quickly makes her escape.
- Uhh! Ohh!

1181
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:52,870
- Put your damn clothes on, Jim.
- You got it, partner.

1182
00:57:53,118 --> 00:57:56,999
Sawyer is a cop but struggles
with the same dark past.

1183
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:58,847
Hurley is a lottery winner,

1184
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:01,246
and good fortune follows
him wherever he goes...

1185
00:58:01,414 --> 00:58:03,047
Everybody loves Hugo.

1186
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,471
- But he is unlucky in love.
- I'm too busy to meet someone.

1187
00:58:06,702 --> 00:58:08,887
- No marry.
- Sun and Jin are not married

1188
00:58:09,096 --> 00:58:12,982
yet carry on a secret love affair.

1189
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:16,685
- Try to relax.
- Claire is pregnant and struggling

1190
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:18,471
with the decision to give up her baby.

1191
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,887
Sayid is haunted by his troubled past.

1192
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:24,149
He is still in love with Nadia,

1193
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,351
but she's married to his brother.

1194
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,935
Locke is happily engaged
to his girlfriend Helen.

1195
00:58:30,223 --> 00:58:33,110
You are a very sweet man.

1196
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:35,758
Mm. These stories are
about something else.

1197
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,382
You know, can they find each other again?

1198
00:58:37,582 --> 00:58:39,062
Can they impact each other's lives?

1199
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:42,590
Would they ever have met if the
island hadn't intervened in some way?

1200
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:46,183
Jack Shephard. I'm John. John Locke.

1201
00:58:47,734 --> 00:58:50,046
- It's nice to meet you, John.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1202
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:50,966
On the island,

1203
00:58:51,134 --> 00:58:53,670
Locke never told Jack that
he was in a wheelchair.

1204
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:56,062
Jack just so happens
to be a spinal surgeon.

1205
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:57,949
Surgery isn't gonna
do anything to help me.

1206
00:58:58,214 --> 00:59:00,046
My condition is irreversible.

1207
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,614
Nothing's irreversible.

1208
00:59:03,494 --> 00:59:06,598
These strangers began to
impact each other's lives.

1209
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:09,566
We were on the same flight... Sydney.

1210
00:59:09,694 --> 00:59:11,742
Although Kate was clearly on
the wrong side of the law...

1211
00:59:11,893 --> 00:59:13,126
Ladies first.

1212
00:59:13,398 --> 00:59:14,446
Thanks.

1213
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:16,070
You take care.

1214
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,718
Sawyer let her get away.

1215
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:21,254
- Go! I said "go."
- What are you doing?

1216
00:59:21,398 --> 00:59:22,878
She encountered Claire,

1217
00:59:22,982 --> 00:59:24,926
and the two formed an unexpected bond.

1218
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:27,534
It's really cool having
these moments with somebody

1219
00:59:27,654 --> 00:59:29,222
that you really know nothing about

1220
00:59:29,375 --> 00:59:34,430
- but you just immediately trust
and you don't even know why.
- In the sideways,

1221
00:59:34,605 --> 00:59:37,518
Kate feels this strange
connection with this woman,

1222
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:39,485
this pregnant woman.
She wants to help her.

1223
00:59:39,622 --> 00:59:40,518
Everything is just fine.

1224
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:43,302
Your boy just likes to move around.

1225
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:44,526
The prospect of that,

1226
00:59:44,638 --> 00:59:46,382
for me, was really exciting.

1227
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:50,383
I loved the idea of
exploring the "what if?"

1228
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:52,766
- John Locke lost his job...
- Dude!

1229
00:59:52,981 --> 00:59:54,318
Which led to another connection.

1230
00:59:54,526 --> 00:59:56,543
Hurley, it turns out,
is actually the owner

1231
00:59:56,678 --> 01:00:00,942
- of the very company that
John Locke has been working for.
- I own a temp agency, too.

1232
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:03,135
And Hurley, in turn, gets John Locke a job

1233
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:06,167
as a substitute teacher at this school.

1234
01:00:06,286 --> 01:00:08,343
Some of the other teachers
there are familiar faces...

1235
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,383
- most notably Benjamin Linus.
- I don't believe we've met.

1236
01:00:11,622 --> 01:00:14,038
- John Locke. Substitute.
- Well, welcome.

1237
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,863
There's little moments of bleed through

1238
01:00:17,223 --> 01:00:20,022
- between the realities there.
- Maybe you should be the principal.

1239
01:00:21,175 --> 01:00:23,471
There have been times when Ben thinks

1240
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:27,486
he knows this guy from
somewhere. What is it?

1241
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,758
You don't remember me, do you?

1242
01:00:29,903 --> 01:00:31,446
Should I?

1243
01:00:31,702 --> 01:00:35,542
It kind of gives you a little
something new to play this season

1244
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,903
in kinda getting to see the other
sides of people as they played them.

1245
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:44,061
For Sun, the whole buttoning
the sweater and unbuttoning it...

1246
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:48,606
she sort of takes that full circle
in Sun and Jin's flash sideways...

1247
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:52,935
you know, taking off that sweater
right in front of Jin to seduce him.

1248
01:00:53,102 --> 01:00:54,807
But when Sun's father
uncovered her secret,

1249
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:57,254
he hired two men to kill Jin.

1250
01:01:00,214 --> 01:01:00,454
Jin defeated them.

1251
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:05,294
But Sun was caught in the crossfire.

1252
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:09,382
Although Sun was shot...

1253
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:12,206
Everything seems to have
turned out okay, and currently,

1254
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:14,463
she's convalescing in the same hospital

1255
01:01:14,686 --> 01:01:16,950
where a number of our other
characters happen to be.

1256
01:01:17,118 --> 01:01:20,406
- What is your deal, Jim?
- All right, look, I go out with
her, you gonna leave me alone?

1257
01:01:20,598 --> 01:01:23,566
In the sideways, Sawyer
is a little bit at a loss

1258
01:01:23,662 --> 01:01:26,086
in his own life in terms
of his romantic interests,

1259
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:28,254
and Miles, his partner,
is trying to fix him up

1260
01:01:28,438 --> 01:01:30,720
with various people, including Charlotte,

1261
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:32,358
who we met on the island.

1262
01:01:32,535 --> 01:01:33,902
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

1263
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:35,606
But then Sawyer kind of blows that up.

1264
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:38,645
As he's going about his
life and duties as a cop...

1265
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,462
Ohh!

1266
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:43,310
Who runs into him again but Kate Austen.

1267
01:01:45,142 --> 01:01:47,078
And he takes Kate Austen
and he locks her up in jail,

1268
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:49,422
and yet he's still got this
strange connection with her,

1269
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:51,582
and he doesn't really quite understand it.

1270
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:53,935
Of all the cars in Los
Angeles, you smash into mine.

1271
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:58,086
- Almost like someone's trying to put us together.
- Are you hitting on me?

1272
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:01,758
But Kate isn't the only one
who captured Sawyer's attention.

1273
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:06,310
An A.T.M. surveillance camera grabbed
this jaboney fleeing the scene.

1274
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,806
All righty. And the name of that face?

1275
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:10,895
Sayid finds himself in
a set of circumstances

1276
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,039
where he gets involved
in some criminal activity.

1277
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:18,351
It's still a character
that's, uh, near to violence.

1278
01:02:18,445 --> 01:02:20,519
Somehow the same destiny
seems to have trapped him.

1279
01:02:20,758 --> 01:02:22,910
As a result, he goes on
the run and finds himself

1280
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:25,358
being pursued now by Sawyer and Miles.

1281
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:28,168
- Mrs. Jarrah, I'm Detective Straume.
- So in another way,

1282
01:02:28,302 --> 01:02:32,343
- we find that our characters are all connecting.
- We do seem to be that the sum total

1283
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:34,839
- of the choices that we make.
- You're under arrest.

1284
01:02:35,069 --> 01:02:38,798
Certain choices are
invariably full of consequence,

1285
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:41,693
and some of those consequences
can be quite damaging.

1286
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:42,790
Sir, you're a doctor?

1287
01:02:42,879 --> 01:02:44,295
- Yes.
- Could you come with me, please?

1288
01:02:44,462 --> 01:02:48,982
- There's one character in
the sideways... Charlie Pace...
- He's not breathing.

1289
01:02:49,103 --> 01:02:51,862
Who basically is choking
on this bag of heroin

1290
01:02:51,998 --> 01:02:54,319
that he is trying to
conceal. He says that he had

1291
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:57,606
a near-death experience, and
he saw this image of love.

1292
01:02:57,782 --> 01:03:03,070
A woman... blonde, rapturously beautiful.

1293
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:04,502
We know that Charlie loved Claire.

1294
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,384
In the sideways, they've never met,

1295
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,470
but he's describing her to a tee.

1296
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:12,605
Well, that's just... poetry, brother.

1297
01:03:12,758 --> 01:03:14,302
Desmond works for Charles Widmore...

1298
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,254
- Welcome to Los Angeles, my friend.
- Thank you.

1299
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,798
And was assigned to
be Charlie's chaperone.

1300
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,926
Have you heard of a
band called drive shaft?

1301
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:22,622
No, can't say I have.

1302
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:25,599
He was leading an empty
life. He wasn't depressed,

1303
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:27,118
but it was just... there
was something missing,

1304
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:28,750
and he knew there was something
missing, and he couldn't

1305
01:03:28,902 --> 01:03:32,342
- put his finger on it.
- Charlie took the opportunity
to show Desmond what he saw.

1306
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:34,470
So Charlie grabs the wheel.

1307
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:36,222
He takes Desmond's car off this pier,

1308
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:37,542
and they go into the water,

1309
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:41,046
and as Desmond is trying to
extricate Charlie from the car,

1310
01:03:41,182 --> 01:03:43,142
Charlie puts his hand
up against the window,

1311
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:46,630
and Desmond suddenly has this
flash of when Charlie died,

1312
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,959
and written on Charlie's
hand is " not Penny's boat."

1313
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:50,734
Desmond, of course, has never met Penny,

1314
01:03:50,846 --> 01:03:52,678
doesn't know that name,
but he has this sort of

1315
01:03:52,727 --> 01:03:55,911
profound sense of the
most ultimate déjà vu

1316
01:03:56,046 --> 01:03:58,382
you could ever experience.
This means something to him.

1317
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:00,063
Desmond.

1318
01:04:00,198 --> 01:04:02,863
And I thought, ah, I've seen
something. I've seen the light.

1319
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,166
But I think it's even beyond that.

1320
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:06,102
- I think he's become more enlightened.
- Who's Penny?

1321
01:04:06,454 --> 01:04:08,014
Desmond's awakening

1322
01:04:08,166 --> 01:04:10,366
set a series of key events in motion.

1323
01:04:10,584 --> 01:04:12,294
These two worlds are starting to move

1324
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:14,206
a little bit closer
together, and the reason is

1325
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,773
that Desmond Hume had
a moment of awareness.

1326
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,975
He seems to have some complete
and total memory of the island.

1327
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:22,062
Can you get me the manifest
from our flight from Sydney?

1328
01:04:22,182 --> 01:04:26,847
- Oceanic 815.
- Do you mind if I ask you what you need it for?

1329
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:30,166
I just need to show them something.

1330
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:39,025
- During the final season of "Lost"...
- Run! Run!

1331
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:44,144
The story on the island
dove deep into mythology

1332
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:48,920
- and explored its great mysteries.
- You wanna know a secret, Jack?

1333
01:04:49,024 --> 01:04:50,920
Something I've known a long, long time?

1334
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:53,008
We're not on an island. We never were.

1335
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:55,241
We're in hell.

1336
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,073
I've known him since I was 12 years old.

1337
01:04:59,201 --> 01:05:01,184
Richard looked just like he does today.

1338
01:05:01,393 --> 01:05:02,545
I started to get an inkling

1339
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,584
that he was a little different
than... than I'd imagined,

1340
01:05:05,706 --> 01:05:09,145
um... I guess when I found
out that he didn't age.

1341
01:05:09,256 --> 01:05:13,168
- And how the hell do you think that happened?
- For a long time, people on the show wondered,

1342
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,049
what is the story with
this guy Richard Alpert?

1343
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:16,497
The guy doesn't appear to age.

1344
01:05:16,632 --> 01:05:20,664
- It looks like he's wearing mascara, uh, eyeliner.
- Are these two things related?

1345
01:05:20,753 --> 01:05:21,680
- Are they related?
- Yeah.

1346
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:25,289
And we learned definitively, number
one, he is not wearing eyeliner.

1347
01:05:26,721 --> 01:05:30,464
The flashback with
Richard Alpert was killer.

1348
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:33,386
I think everyone loved that,
and I was right in that crowd.

1349
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:40,001
Alpert was a poor field-worker in
the Canary Islands of the 1860s.

1350
01:05:40,056 --> 01:05:42,825
It was a period piece. I
mean, it felt like a mini movie

1351
01:05:42,912 --> 01:05:44,489
within the context of "Lost."

1352
01:05:44,689 --> 01:05:46,713
And it had sort of classic
themes and elements.

1353
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,601
A series of tragic events
led to Alpert's arrest.

1354
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,097
He was sold as a slave and confined
on a ship bound for the New World.

1355
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:02,985
The vessel was drawn to the island
and shipwrecked during a violent storm.

1356
01:06:03,265 --> 01:06:04,879
For many years, the
audience has been wondering,

1357
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,273
how the heck did that ship get
in the middle of the jungle?

1358
01:06:07,392 --> 01:06:10,081
And in this episode, we actually
finally learn what happens.

1359
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,065
After six torturous days,

1360
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:15,353
Alpert was freed by the man in black...

1361
01:06:15,537 --> 01:06:17,513
It's good to see you out of those chains.

1362
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:20,631
But soon became a pawn in
his age-old war with Jacob.

1363
01:06:20,776 --> 01:06:22,913
I didn't know that they would really go

1364
01:06:23,032 --> 01:06:25,241
into the depths that they did
with this... with this episode,

1365
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:26,321
and I certainly didn't know

1366
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:29,985
- that the episode would
be tied to the mythology.
- My name is Jacob.

1367
01:06:30,121 --> 01:06:34,616
Alpert became Jacob's advisor
in exchange for eternal life.

1368
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,376
I was thrilled when I got
to not only partake in that

1369
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:39,808
but also just learn as a
fan about what was at play

1370
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:43,800
- on the island.
- Think of this wine as what you keep calling hell.

1371
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:45,464
Malevolence. Evil.

1372
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:46,865
The cork...

1373
01:06:47,832 --> 01:06:50,312
is this island, and it's the only thing

1374
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:52,680
keeping the darkness where it belongs.

1375
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:55,577
When you're first introduced
to Jacob and the man in black,

1376
01:06:55,672 --> 01:06:58,049
our assumption is, maybe
they're the God and the devil,

1377
01:06:58,216 --> 01:07:00,457
maybe they're good and evil.
Who are these guys exactly?

1378
01:07:00,552 --> 01:07:02,464
And we recently learned,
well, they're guys.

1379
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,873
You know, they have a history

1380
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:05,920
just like any other character on the show.

1381
01:07:06,113 --> 01:07:08,712
Jacob and the man in black were brothers,

1382
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:11,192
born on the island a very long time ago.

1383
01:07:12,497 --> 01:07:13,905
They were raised by a woman

1384
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,088
- who was the protector of the island.
- What is this place?

1385
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:18,888
This is the reason we're here.

1386
01:07:19,208 --> 01:07:22,449
The boys grew into men
and were led to believe

1387
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,425
- there was nothing beyond the island.
- I'm leaving, Jacob.

1388
01:07:25,568 --> 01:07:27,713
No, that's impossible. There
is no way off the island.

1389
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,400
Eventually, Jacob was chosen
as the new protector...

1390
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:34,528
Now you and I are the same.

1391
01:07:34,712 --> 01:07:37,441
And the man in black
learned he'd been deceived.

1392
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:41,041
And eventually, this builds to this
great sort of Shakespearean tragedy

1393
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,481
in which...

1394
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,209
The man in black kills his own mother.

1395
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,889
You wanna leave this
place, brother?! Then go!

1396
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:50,360
And Jacob takes the man in black

1397
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:53,120
and throws him down into
this mysterious cavern,

1398
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:54,992
and the monster emerges.

1399
01:07:55,241 --> 01:08:00,545
This is the origin of how the man in
black turned into the smoke monster.

1400
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:03,081
Once he is the smoke monster,
he only can assume the form

1401
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:04,696
of dead people on the island.

1402
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,680
The man in black appeared
as Christian Shephard.

1403
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,328
He most notably takes
the form of John Locke.

1404
01:08:11,497 --> 01:08:13,449
It's good to see you out of those chains.

1405
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,449
But the man in black
can also take the form

1406
01:08:15,584 --> 01:08:18,584
- of his own corporal body.
- To leave the island,

1407
01:08:18,736 --> 01:08:20,553
the man in black had to kill Jacob,

1408
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,784
but rules prevented him
from doing so himself.

1409
01:08:23,928 --> 01:08:27,408
- Just let me leave, Jacob.
- As long as I'm alive,
you're not going anywhere.

1410
01:08:27,568 --> 01:08:31,496
- I will kill you, Jacob.
- Even if you do, somebody
else will take my place.

1411
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:33,489
Well, then I'll kill them, too.

1412
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,584
You're not gonna steal anymore, are you?

1413
01:08:38,729 --> 01:08:40,216
Be good, Katie.

1414
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:42,215
We see in flashbacks that basically

1415
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:44,927
Jacob has touched our plane survivors

1416
01:08:45,145 --> 01:08:47,552
- in their past lives.
- It's your choice, Hugo.

1417
01:08:47,689 --> 01:08:50,216
Jacob's touch protected
them from being killed

1418
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:53,207
and marked them as candidates
to be his successor.

1419
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,624
So the man in black knows
who the replacements are,

1420
01:08:55,777 --> 01:08:57,985
and he knows when Oceanic 815 crashes

1421
01:08:58,121 --> 01:09:00,281
that some of Jacob's precious candidates

1422
01:09:00,376 --> 01:09:02,993
are, in fact, on that plane,
so he starts to check 'em out.

1423
01:09:03,241 --> 01:09:05,537
We might just have, uh,
first been introduced

1424
01:09:05,665 --> 01:09:09,041
to the man in black in the pilot itself.

1425
01:09:09,144 --> 01:09:11,352
They hear this monster sound... arrr!

1426
01:09:11,457 --> 01:09:14,968
- Yes. That's exactly what it sounded like.
- Something like that. Yeah.

1427
01:09:15,128 --> 01:09:16,993
And one of the first people
that he checks out is John Locke.

1428
01:09:17,088 --> 01:09:18,945
Very early in the series,

1429
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:20,504
the monster angles in on Locke,

1430
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:23,816
and Locke says that he
saw this beautiful thing.

1431
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:27,225
Maybe that's the moment when
the man in black first decided,

1432
01:09:27,361 --> 01:09:29,913
"this is my guy. I'm
gonna become this guy."

1433
01:09:30,073 --> 01:09:32,449
- You're alive?
- Yes, I am.

1434
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:34,232
I had all of season 5 not knowing

1435
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,208
that I was, in fact, that character.

1436
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:39,137
I was just being John Locke,
who now wasn't as afraid.

1437
01:09:39,272 --> 01:09:41,752
What, John? Don't you trust
me here with my former people?

1438
01:09:41,905 --> 01:09:44,273
I'm not afraid of anything
you can do anymore, Ben.

1439
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:46,105
The man in black emerged.

1440
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:48,336
This was somebody who was
simply gonna get what he wanted.

1441
01:09:48,538 --> 01:09:52,041
The man in black had all
the pieces in place...

1442
01:09:52,184 --> 01:09:53,520
Hello, Jacob.

1443
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:57,481
And manipulated Ben to
finally kill his Nemesis.

1444
01:10:02,817 --> 01:10:04,488
So now he's executed this plan.

1445
01:10:04,609 --> 01:10:06,305
It's time for phase two, which is,

1446
01:10:06,408 --> 01:10:08,688
in order for the man in
black to leave the island,

1447
01:10:08,801 --> 01:10:11,289
all of Jacob's candidates have to be dead.

1448
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,225
Ford. You're a candidate.

1449
01:10:14,425 --> 01:10:15,880
Candidate for what?

1450
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:19,544
Become the new Jacob
and protect the island.

1451
01:10:19,656 --> 01:10:21,377
And we learn that Jack is a candidate,

1452
01:10:21,512 --> 01:10:23,609
Hurley was a candidate,
John Locke was a candidate

1453
01:10:23,736 --> 01:10:27,760
- before he died.
- Right. When you die, you're
no longer a candidate...

1454
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,106
- You're no longer a candidate.
- And you have to have a press
conference and everything.

1455
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:33,616
- Kwon is one of them.
- Does that mean me or Sun?

1456
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:37,785
Well, Jin, I'm not sure.
But what it does mean is that

1457
01:10:37,912 --> 01:10:40,369
the only way we can leave the island is if

1458
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:44,481
all of the names that haven't
been crossed off go together.

1459
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:47,993
The man in black is attempting
to manipulate our candidates,

1460
01:10:48,128 --> 01:10:52,121
and he is trying to put them in a
situation where he can kill them.

1461
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:56,018
The man in black
recruited Claire and Sayid.

1462
01:10:56,209 --> 01:10:58,127
He tried to kill Desmond...

1463
01:10:58,328 --> 01:10:59,592
Aah!

1464
01:11:00,513 --> 01:11:02,857
And left a path of
destruction in his wake.

1465
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:06,696
The man in black's
series of calculated moves

1466
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,057
brought the candidates together.

1467
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,128
No! They're leaving us!

1468
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:14,304
No, trust me. You don't
wanna be on that sub.

1469
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:15,521
They get on the submarine,

1470
01:11:15,649 --> 01:11:17,249
and they think that they're
free, but all of a sudden,

1471
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:20,625
- they discover in this backpack is this bomb.
- If I don't pull these wires,

1472
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,217
- Locke's gonna blow us to kingdom come.
- No, he's not!

1473
01:11:23,296 --> 01:11:26,737
- Locke can't kill us.
- Uh... what?

1474
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,489
He's trying to get us to kill each other.

1475
01:11:28,712 --> 01:11:30,552
Stay out of my way, doc.

1476
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:36,712
The timer accelerated, so
Sayid sacrificed himself.

1477
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,024
Uhh!

1478
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:43,153
But the explosion left Sun trapped.

1479
01:11:43,304 --> 01:11:45,497
Jin, go!

1480
01:11:46,024 --> 01:11:48,376
No! Go! I'll get her free!

1481
01:11:48,465 --> 01:11:50,008
No! We can do this!

1482
01:11:50,096 --> 01:11:51,544
Just go! Save Sawyer!

1483
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:54,232
The fact that Jin decides
to stay with Sun...

1484
01:11:54,329 --> 01:11:58,241
it was just a very heroic, romantic,

1485
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:00,512
you know, ending for Sun and Jin.

1486
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,128
You have to go.

1487
01:12:02,232 --> 01:12:04,242
I won't leave you.

1488
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,081
I just never expected for them
to keep us apart for so long,

1489
01:12:08,344 --> 01:12:10,584
and only to have us come together

1490
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,136
and sort of be united in our death.

1491
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,290
I love you, Sun.

1492
01:12:15,417 --> 01:12:16,705
I love you.

1493
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:20,296
His one priority in life was his wife.

1494
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,168
For that, ultimately,
he did sacrifice himself,

1495
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,368
and that, to me,

1496
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:28,112
is as noble an end as
anyone could hope for.

1497
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:30,256
What about Jin and Sun?

1498
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:49,260
As the final chapters of "Lost"

1499
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,157
two parallel storylines
are drawing closer together.

1500
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:56,349
- Were you on Oceanic Flight 815?
- Yeah.

1501
01:12:56,493 --> 01:12:59,197
- So was I.
- Wow. What a coincidence.

1502
01:12:59,318 --> 01:13:01,701
In the sideways, Desmond
decides it's his mission

1503
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:04,957
to go out and basically try to
catalyze the other characters

1504
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:07,750
- so they can have their awakenings.
- I met a girl on a blind date the other night.

1505
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:10,365
She told me that we
already knew each other.

1506
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:12,380
And that? I'd remember.

1507
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,285
Did you believe her when
she said she knew you?

1508
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:16,877
Yeah.

1509
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:20,253
Then I say, go with your gut.

1510
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:23,013
Eventually, he is reunited with Libby,

1511
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,782
and they go on this date,

1512
01:13:24,925 --> 01:13:26,861
and she's having this
weird sense of déjà vu.

1513
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:29,101
She can't quite put her finger
on it. But when they kiss,

1514
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:31,932
Hurley suddenly remembers
being on the island.

1515
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,197
- Dude...
- What?

1516
01:13:35,421 --> 01:13:36,958
I think I'm remembering stuff.

1517
01:13:37,486 --> 01:13:39,756
And he now seems to be
exactly like Desmond.

1518
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:41,157
We don't know exactly what he knows,

1519
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:46,246
- but he certainly knows a lot.
- With Hurley on the road to
awakening, Desmond moved on

1520
01:13:46,348 --> 01:13:49,172
to another person in
need of enlightenment.

1521
01:13:49,286 --> 01:13:52,093
He literally runs over
John Locke in a wheelchair.

1522
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,525
- That seems pretty direct to me.
- And...

1523
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:01,380
"Officer, I was just
catalyzing an awakening."

1524
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:02,901
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1525
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:04,590
Desmond turned himself over to Sawyer

1526
01:14:04,725 --> 01:14:07,485
and joined Sayid and Kate in jail.

1527
01:14:08,268 --> 01:14:11,373
And shortly afterward, Hurley
arranged for their release.

1528
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:12,830
- Sorry I'm late, dude.
- Don't worry about it.

1529
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,669
Desmond and Hurley are
kind of working in tandem

1530
01:14:15,797 --> 01:14:18,765
to... to try to help awaken
some of these characters.

1531
01:14:18,892 --> 01:14:21,413
Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.

1532
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:22,502
What do you mean, I'm with you?

1533
01:14:22,637 --> 01:14:24,853
We...

1534
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,204
are going to a concert.

1535
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:30,462
I think the point is that
we all know everything

1536
01:14:30,573 --> 01:14:33,877
that we already need to know
about ourselves right now.

1537
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:36,908
We just need to open our eyes and see it.

1538
01:14:37,285 --> 01:14:39,996
- You're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.
- What do we got?

1539
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,045
When Jack discovered that
Locke was his patient...

1540
01:14:43,197 --> 01:14:44,637
I think I know this guy.

1541
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:47,381
The coincidence seemed
too great to ignore.

1542
01:14:47,773 --> 01:14:48,900
For some reason,

1543
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:53,077
Jack feels this overwhelming
desire to fix John Locke,

1544
01:14:53,205 --> 01:14:55,380
- to make him walk again.
- While I was operating, I got a look

1545
01:14:55,485 --> 01:14:56,957
at the initial injury to your spine.

1546
01:14:57,069 --> 01:14:59,596
I think that I could fix you.

1547
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:03,357
After much contemplation,
Locke accepted Jack's offer.

1548
01:15:03,517 --> 01:15:06,197
Maybe this is happening for a reason.

1549
01:15:06,366 --> 01:15:07,805
Maybe you're supposed to fix me.

1550
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,940
One thing that is really coming into play

1551
01:15:10,045 --> 01:15:12,548
is this idea of
characters asking for help.

1552
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,053
I think I'm ready to
get out of this chair.

1553
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:17,765
The fact that they are
able to help each other

1554
01:15:17,884 --> 01:15:20,574
seems to make all the
difference in their lives,

1555
01:15:20,685 --> 01:15:23,525
and this is a big difference
between the two worlds.

1556
01:15:24,581 --> 01:15:25,654
On the island,

1557
01:15:25,756 --> 01:15:28,428
the remaining survivors mourned
the loss of their friends.

1558
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:30,157
They had a little girl, you know.

1559
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,693
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

1560
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,684
Locke did this to them.

1561
01:15:41,285 --> 01:15:42,764
We have to kill him, Jack.

1562
01:15:45,997 --> 01:15:47,078
I know.

1563
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:49,932
They want to get revenge for
what happened to their friends.

1564
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,029
Um, they wanna be able to kill Locke,

1565
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,669
but they have no idea how to do this.

1566
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:56,462
Jack and Kate and Hurley
and Sawyer get sidetracked

1567
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,533
by none other than Jacob himself.

1568
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,373
I chose you because you were like me.

1569
01:16:01,548 --> 01:16:03,774
You were all alone.

1570
01:16:05,285 --> 01:16:06,644
You were all looking for something

1571
01:16:06,764 --> 01:16:08,541
that you couldn't find out there...

1572
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:12,724
Because you needed this place
as much as it needed you.

1573
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:16,780
The time had come for the island's
new protector to step forward.

1574
01:16:16,965 --> 01:16:19,381
For a long time, Jack has
been searching for the reason

1575
01:16:19,502 --> 01:16:22,021
that he was brought to
this island and the reason

1576
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:24,462
that he came back to this
island after leaving it.

1577
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:25,909
I'll do it.

1578
01:16:26,422 --> 01:16:29,174
He now firmly believes
that he came to this island

1579
01:16:29,294 --> 01:16:31,428
because it's his job to now protect it.

1580
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,316
This is what I'm supposed to do.

1581
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:35,053
Then it's time.

1582
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,676
Jack takes this mission on willingly,

1583
01:16:37,813 --> 01:16:40,878
and in fact, for Jack, it's
a fulfillment of a quest

1584
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,789
that's basically spanned
the entire series.

1585
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,422
I'm so happy with how
it's all coming to an end,

1586
01:16:46,524 --> 01:16:48,717
and it... it just feels so right.

1587
01:16:48,925 --> 01:16:50,077
Drink this.

1588
01:16:50,892 --> 01:16:52,804
We want the last frame of the last show

1589
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:56,517
to be about these people who we
introduced you to six years ago

1590
01:16:56,645 --> 01:17:00,093
and carried you on journeys
with and leave you with them

1591
01:17:00,205 --> 01:17:01,357
and leave you with their stories.

1592
01:17:02,006 --> 01:17:03,573
How long am I gonna have to do this job?

1593
01:17:03,822 --> 01:17:06,612
As long as you can.

1594
01:17:06,765 --> 01:17:10,797
To watch the show come back to
the roots that it started from

1595
01:17:10,965 --> 01:17:14,677
and end in the same way
that it started is a victory.

1596
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:17,205
You don't want the book to come to an end,

1597
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:19,253
but you close the book and
you go, "God, that was great."

1598
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:23,381
Now you're like me.

1599
01:17:24,317 --> 01:17:25,781
We're hoping for a
legacy where people say,

1600
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,517
"I invested six years of my life

1601
01:17:27,637 --> 01:17:29,909
really caring deeply about this show,

1602
01:17:30,014 --> 01:17:32,309
and I feel that the way that it ended

1603
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,357
showed an... an equal amount of respect

1604
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:36,949
in caring for the show on
the part of the storytellers."

1605
01:17:37,557 --> 01:17:38,581
We're here.

1606
01:17:39,549 --> 01:17:43,157
We felt like we made the show that we
wanted to make, from start to finish.

1607
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:47,493
The larger messages that we
wanted the audience to take away,

1608
01:17:47,605 --> 01:17:50,157
we feel are embedded in
the show and in the finale.

1609
01:17:51,285 --> 01:17:53,069
The idea that here we are
looking down the barrel

1610
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:56,126
of that ending is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

1611
01:17:56,381 --> 01:17:58,605
Words can't express the
gratitude that I feel

1612
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:03,253
- to... to have been able to be a part of that.
- Looks like someone helped him out.

1613
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:05,052
It wouldn't be "Lost"

1614
01:18:05,157 --> 01:18:07,694
if we still didn't keep a
few things close to the chest.

1615
01:18:07,997 --> 01:18:09,661
No, Ben, someone helped me out...

1616
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:13,148
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

1617
01:18:14,614 --> 01:18:16,716
And when I do, he's gonna help me do

1618
01:18:16,852 --> 01:18:19,701
the one thing that I
could never do myself.

1619
01:18:21,334 --> 01:18:23,180
I'm gonna destroy the island.

1620
01:18:26,521 --> 01:18:29,079
We really don't believe that we
ever would have made it this far

1621
01:18:29,215 --> 01:18:31,152
if it weren't for the
incredible, you know,

1622
01:18:31,247 --> 01:18:33,400
fan base of the show. It's pretty trippy

1623
01:18:33,528 --> 01:18:35,775
- and really wonderful.
- The greatest thing is...

1624
01:18:36,272 --> 01:18:38,112
that we could have ever
imagined as storytellers

1625
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:40,144
was the ability to be a
part of that community.

1626
01:18:40,264 --> 01:18:43,176
This show doesn't feel like
it's something that we made.

1627
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:46,087
It feels like something that kind of,

1628
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:48,521
um, you know, existed and
we were able to tap into.

1629
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,608
We're profoundly grateful
for having the chance to...

1630
01:18:51,703 --> 01:18:54,840
to not only kind of build that world

1631
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:56,367
but to be a part of it.

1632
