1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,593
Previously on Lost...

2
00:00:02,495 --> 00:00:04,134
- Dude, where did that come from?
- Locke.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:05,982
What if he's trying to
get us killed each other?

4
00:00:05,818 --> 00:00:07,219
I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!

5
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,523
You just have to trust me.

6
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:09,818
Sorry, doc, I don't.

7
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:13,436
Sayid!

8
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:20,731
- Go! I'll get her free.
- No, we can do this!

9
00:00:20,842 --> 00:00:22,282
Just go! Save Sawyer!

10
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,171
I won't leave you.

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,578
- I love you, Sun.
- I love you!

12
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,385
What about Jin and Sun?

13
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:17,164
Morning.

14
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:18,739
Morning.

15
00:01:19,052 --> 00:01:19,851
I made breakfast.

16
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:23,763
You know, technically,
opening a box of cereal

17
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,172
is not making breakfast.

18
00:01:27,748 --> 00:01:29,172
So you're coming to the
concert tonight, right?

19
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:30,947
Absolutely.

20
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,987
Is your mom coming, too?

21
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:34,763
Yeah.

22
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:37,916
Why?

23
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,508
- You're not gonna get all weird, are you?
- Why would I get weird?

24
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,515
Just don't get weird.

25
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:44,965
I won't.

26
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,508
Morning.

27
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:53,203
- Morning.
- Morning.

28
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:57,019
You want some cereal?

29
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:58,491
Um, sure. Thanks.

30
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:09,708
How you feeling?

31
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:10,779
Uh, pretty good.

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,179
I mean, he kicks like
crazy at night, so...

33
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,955
Jack Shephard.

34
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:23,435
Hello, Mr. Shephard.

35
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,995
Uh, this is Oceanic Airlines calling

36
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,635
to inform you that we've, um,

37
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,379
we've located your missing cargo.

38
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,620
My father's coffin... you found it?

39
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:35,220
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,412
It'll be arriving in Los
Angeles by the end of the day.

41
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,891
That's, uh, that's great news. Thank you.

42
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:41,933
Of course, sir.

43
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,500
We at oceanic are very
sorry it's taken so long.

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,939
Good day, sir.

45
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:12,388
This was the best I could do,

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,036
and it's gonna hurt a bit.

47
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:30,900
The bullet went through, but if I don't
do this, it's gonna get infected.

48
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:33,404
Okay. I'm sorry.

49
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,124
They had a little girl, you know.

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,467
Her name was...

51
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,659
Ji Yeon.

52
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:55,883
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

53
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,372
Locke did this to them.

54
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,228
We have to kill him, Jack.

55
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:13,253
I know.

56
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:22,044

www.addic7ed.com

58
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,876
We should get going now.

59
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:22,219
Go where?

60
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,644
Before Sayid died,
he said that Desmond was in a well.

61
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:29,756
If Locke wants Desmond dead,
then we're gonna need him.

62
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,060
Welcome back, Mr. Locke.
It's good to see you.

63
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:51,324
Thank you. You, too.

64
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,788
Hey! Don't you dare.

65
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,948
It's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke!

66
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,316
Somebody call the police right now!

67
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,084
I saw what you did. I'm making a
citizen's arrest. - Do not get in my way.

68
00:06:09,242 --> 00:06:09,844
Don't you...

69
00:06:14,628 --> 00:06:17,261
I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!

70
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,292
I'm not here to hurt him. I am here...

71
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,459
- To help him let go.
- Who are you?

72
00:06:24,628 --> 00:06:25,765
You wanna know who I am?

73
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,108
You sure this is a shortcut, huh?

74
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:00,301
I lived in these houses
a long time, Miles.

75
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:02,780
I think I can remember how to get there.

76
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,379
Well, I lived in these houses
30 years before you did...

77
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,243
otherwise known as last week.

78
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,973
- And I have no idea where the hell we are.
- Guess it's a good thing you're following me.

79
00:07:12,788 --> 00:07:15,467
You mind if I ask how much
explosive you have access to, Ben?

80
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:17,755
More than enough to destroy
the plane ten times over

81
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,371
and keep it from ever leaving this island.

82
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,627
Been a long time.
You sure it's still there?

83
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:26,108
It's c-4, Richard.
I put some thought into hiding it.

84
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:27,740
Let me guess... cookie jar.

85
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,203
Don't be ridiculous.

86
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,772
It's in my secret room
behind the bookcase.

87
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,499
What's wrong?

88
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:01,012
It's just, I, you know,
I get wonky around dead stuff.

89
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:02,741
Do you have something you
wanna share with us, Miles?

90
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,291
I... I don't think...

91
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:07,692
- What is it?
- It's Alex.

92
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,300
It's your daughter.

93
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,740
After you left, I buried her.

94
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:35,163
Thank you, Richard.

95
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,285
What's that? A secreter room?

96
00:09:07,436 --> 00:09:09,412
It's where I was told I
could summon the monster.

97
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:13,443
That's before I realized that it
was the one summoning me.

98
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,332
Okay. Richard, it's your idea.

99
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,932
Are we looking to cripple the
plane or blow it to hell?

100
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:34,860
Blow it to hell.

101
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,540
Then we'd better take it all.

102
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,316
Don't move!

103
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:56,579
Show me your hands.

104
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:59,388
Calm down. It's... it's okay.

105
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,052
Who the hell are you?

106
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,163
She's with me.

107
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,163
Hello, Benjamin.

108
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:09,995
May I come in?

109
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:19,529
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:21,912
Put the gun down, Benjamin.

111
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,193
Go to the dock.

112
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,952
Take out equipment from the
outrigger and then sink it.

113
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,857
- You got it.
- She's not going anywhere.
If you don't answer me,

114
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,296
- I swear I'll...
- If you shoot me,

115
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,409
then your last chance of
survival will be gone.

116
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,288
Go. He won't do anything.

117
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,202
What are you doing here, Richard?

118
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,473
We're getting explosives to destroy
the plane on the other island.

119
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:50,770
- Why would you want to do that?
- None of your damned business.

120
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:53,120
I've had that plane rigged with
explosives since I got here.

121
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,898
As usual, Benjamin,
I'm three steps ahead of you.

122
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,017
How did you get back here, Charles?

123
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,673
Jacob invited me.

124
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,610
That's a lie. You've
never even seen Jacob.

125
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:07,481
I most certainly have. He visited me,

126
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,409
not long after your people
destroyed my freighter.

127
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,482
He convinced me of the error of my ways

128
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,738
and told me everything I need
to know for this exact purpose.

129
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,521
What purpose?

130
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:22,537
Charles?

131
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,096
Yes.

132
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,496
It's Locke. He's coming.

133
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:29,504
- Has he seen you?
- No, I don't think so.

134
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,818
Our boat is still there.
I didn't have time to...

135
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,530
Run. Get back here as fast as you can.

136
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:38,673
If you don't want to die, we need to hide.

137
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,553
This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.

138
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,057
It's Dr. Linus, actually.

139
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,305
I'll go get you an ice pack.

140
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,610
Dr. Linus?

141
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:09,025
Are you all right? I heard there was

142
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,496
- a... an incident in the parking lot.
- Yes, I got into a fight.

143
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,338
A fight? With who?

144
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,729
I saw the man that ran
you down, Mr. Locke.

145
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,642
He was back. I approached him,
and he just...

146
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,401
attacked me.

147
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,649
And then the strangest thing happened.

148
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,450
While he was beating me,

149
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:30,593
i think... I think I saw something.

150
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:33,185
What are you doing?

151
00:12:33,513 --> 00:12:34,738
I'm calling the police.

152
00:12:34,896 --> 00:12:37,449
- You may not want to do that.
- Well, why wouldn't I want to?

153
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:41,417
The man told me that he
wasn't trying to hurt you.

154
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,369
He told me that he was
trying to get you to let go.

155
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,161
L.A.P.D.

156
00:12:47,793 --> 00:12:49,865
And for some reason, I believed him.

157
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,513
Hello? L.A.P.D.

158
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,201
Do you have any idea what he
was talking about, Mr. Locke?

159
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:57,081
Does that mean something to you?

160
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,058
Hello? L.A.P.D.

161
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,289
Excuse me.

162
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:11,793
Um...

163
00:13:12,554 --> 00:13:14,120
I'd like to see a Detective, please.

164
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,657
What's with the getup? Somebody die?

165
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:20,137
The benefit at my dad's museum?

166
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,442
The concert I've been
telling you about all week?

167
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:25,377
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about.

168
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:28,554
- You can still be my date if you want to.
- That red-headed chick
that hates me gonna be there?

169
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,385
Charlotte. Yeah.

170
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,288
Yeah, pass.

171
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:36,289
Detective Ford, this guy's
got somethin' to tell ya.

172
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:37,449
Yeah?

173
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,313
Um...

174
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,201
there was a hit and run a few days ago

175
00:13:43,345 --> 00:13:44,873
at Washington Tustin high school.

176
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,752
And then this morning

177
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,113
one of the teachers there was...

178
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:54,026
was beaten badly by the...
by the same suspect.

179
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,058
Yeah? And?

180
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,978
I'm the suspect.

181
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:11,938
Thanks for saving the
taxpayers the trouble

182
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:13,953
of hunting you down.

183
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,241
You're welcome.

184
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,417
Good afternoon.

185
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,003
And how are you doing today?

186
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,226
Terrific.

187
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,457
Any idea exactly where this well is?

188
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,928
Sayid said it was close to our camp.

189
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:48,208
We're about an hour away.

190
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:53,425
If Locke wanted Desmond dead,
why didn't he just kill him?

191
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:57,505
Who knows? Maybe it's one of his rules.

192
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,202
The bomb on the sub.

193
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:05,385
You said he couldn't kill us.

194
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,601
I've been wrong before.

195
00:15:16,322 --> 00:15:17,641
I killed them, didn't I?

196
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:21,248
No.

197
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,145
He killed them.

198
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,209
You all right?

199
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,289
Yeah. I'm fine.

200
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:54,185
Okay.

201
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:02,585
Aah!

202
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,514
Give me the ashes.

203
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:06,762
What? Who are you?

204
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,610
Give me the ashes you took from
Ilana's things after she died.

205
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,089
I know they're in your pocket.

206
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,752
- Why?
- Because they're mine.

207
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,105
What do you want 'em for?

208
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:20,225
Hey!

209
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:43,252
Hello, Hugo.

210
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:46,075
Dude.

211
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:49,028
I've been waiting for you to show up.
Where you been?

212
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:50,851
Doesn't matter. I'm here now.

213
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:54,852
Did you see a kid run
by here with your ashes?

214
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:59,515
My ashes are right there in that fire.

215
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,034
When it burns out,
you'll never see me again.

216
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:06,579
Uh, what?

217
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:07,980
You should get your friends.

218
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:11,171
We're very close to the end, Hugo.

219
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,867
Charles, let's go.

220
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,931
There's no time.
Linus has a hidden room. Come on.

221
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:42,540
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not interested in hiding.

222
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,562
He's gonna find me sooner or later anyway.

223
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,220
- I'd rather have it over with.
- These are both great plans, but
I'm gonna go with surviving.

224
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,810
If you need us, we'll be
running through the jungle.

225
00:17:50,956 --> 00:17:51,810
Miles, wait.

226
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:55,067
- Give me your walkie-talkies.
- Why?

227
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:56,195
Because I asked.

228
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:04,051
Thank you. In case I need you.

229
00:18:04,203 --> 00:18:05,354
He's gonna kill you. You know that.

230
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,354
Then I guess this is good-bye.

231
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:14,635
Care to join me outside while
I wait for the inevitable?

232
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:21,178
I... I'm gonna talk to him.
I know this man.

233
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,035
All he wants is for me to join him,

234
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:24,301
and if I can get him to leave with me,

235
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,434
- maybe that'll give the rest of you a chance.
- Good luck with that.

236
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,178
Just the man I was looking for.

237
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,218
Well, you found me.

238
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,427
Can I get you a glass of lemonade?

239
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:02,811
I need you...

240
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:06,299
To kill some people for me, Ben.

241
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,138
And why would I do that?

242
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,930
Because once I leave this island,

243
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,258
you can have it all to yourself.

244
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:18,875
All right.

245
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:20,843
Good.

246
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:25,067
Now... whose outrigger
is that down at the dock?

247
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,635
I believe it's Charles Widmore's.

248
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:31,602
And do you know where I might find him?

249
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,195
He's hiding in my closet.

250
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,266
Oh, my God. Hey, Dr. Linus.

251
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:53,435
Hello, Alex.

252
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:55,802
Oh, my God. What happened?

253
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,178
I found myself confronting someone

254
00:20:57,283 --> 00:20:58,700
- that had a bit of a temper.
- What?

255
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,779
Why would someone want to hurt you?

256
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:05,292
- You're, like, the... the nicest guy ever.
- I guess they had me confused with somebody else.

257
00:21:07,044 --> 00:21:08,138
Well, you shouldn't be driving.

258
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,899
My mom's waiting for me over there.

259
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:12,083
Let us give you a ride home.

260
00:21:12,226 --> 00:21:14,714
Oh, no, I'm not going to
be any trouble to you.

261
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:16,283
Dr. Linus, please.

262
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,867
You've got one hand.
You look like Napoléon.

263
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:23,011
Excellent point.

264
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,547
Hey, mom!

265
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:29,355
Is it okay if we give Dr.
Linus a ride home?

266
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:33,594
Of course.

267
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:35,956
After everything you have
done for my daughter,

268
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,955
a ride is the least we can do.

269
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:39,843
I'm Danielle.

270
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,722
Benjamin Linus.

271
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,844
Hey, mom, can Dr.
Linus come over for dinner?

272
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,635
It's coq au vin night.

273
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,970
- Oh, that's really not necessary...
- Oh, no, no, we insist,

274
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:51,620
even if we have to kidnap you.

275
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,459
Here, please.

276
00:21:58,588 --> 00:22:00,003
Do you mind getting that plate?

277
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:04,483
Dr. Linus...

278
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:05,851
Thank you.

279
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:11,035
It's so nice to be able to cook
for someone other than Alex.

280
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:15,282
If you don't mind my asking,
where is her father?

281
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,930
He died when Alex was 2.

282
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,124
Oh.

283
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:23,362
That's probably why she's
so attached to you.

284
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:26,995
Excuse me?

285
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,730
All the interest you've taken in her,

286
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:32,826
all the help you've given...

287
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,299
you're the closest thing
to a father she's ever had.

288
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,049
Are you...

289
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,354
are you all right?

290
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:06,369
I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.

291
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,954
Oh. I'll put in less next time.

292
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,177
After you.

293
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,954
Charles and his lady friend are in here.

294
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:33,393
She's armed,

295
00:23:34,617 --> 00:23:36,554
but I'm guessing that's
not a problem for you.

296
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,067
Mm.

297
00:23:39,193 --> 00:23:40,209
Wait out here.

298
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:45,234
- You don't need to see this.
- I want to see this.

299
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,050
Sorry, Charles.

300
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,178
What a pleasant surprise.

301
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:16,562
How nice to be able to talk
without those fences between us.

302
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,275
And who might you be?

303
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:23,745
Zoe. My name is Zoe. I...

304
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,561
Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.

305
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,362
Why would you do that?

306
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:34,729
You told her not to talk to me.
That made her pointless.

307
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:36,722
Now, Charles,

308
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,770
it's clear you're not afraid to die.

309
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:41,241
So there's only one way to motivate you

310
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:42,753
to tell me what I want to know.

311
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:49,745
Soon, this will all be over.
I'll get what I want.

312
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,664
And I'll finally leave this island.

313
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:55,178
And when I do, the first
thing I'm going to do

314
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,457
is kill your daughter.

315
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,090
Penny.

316
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:03,019
You'll kill her whether
I talk to you or not.

317
00:25:03,178 --> 00:25:06,825
No, I won't. I give you my word.

318
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,330
And I'm supposed to take your word?

319
00:25:12,497 --> 00:25:14,130
You tell me why I came back here,

320
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,586
and I won't hurt your daughter.

321
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:22,674
I brought Desmond Hume back here

322
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:26,137
because of his unique
resistance to electromagnetism.

323
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,234
He was a measure of last resort.

324
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:34,753
What do you mean, "last resort"?

325
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:36,513
I'm not saying any more in front of him.

326
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:47,169
Well, then whisper to me.

327
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:51,585
Hmm?

328
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:08,001
He doesn't get to save
his daughter.

329
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:18,323
Ben... you never cease to amaze me.

330
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:21,762
Fortunately, he had already
told me what I needed to know,

331
00:26:21,922 --> 00:26:24,249
so... no harm done.

332
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:26,449
Good.

333
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:32,258
Did you say there were
some other people to kill?

334
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:50,914
Hello, Kate.

335
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:53,074
James.

336
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,762
Jack.

337
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,914
- He's right there by the fire. He says hello...
- I heard him.

338
00:27:06,355 --> 00:27:07,689
What, you can see him?

339
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,746
Yeah, I can see him.

340
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:12,874
Kate? Sawyer? You, too?

341
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:17,610
So you're the one who wrote
our names on the wall.

342
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,025
I am.

343
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:21,874
Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah...

344
00:27:22,034 --> 00:27:25,338
- you wrote their names on the wall?
- Yes.

345
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,265
Is that why they're dead?

346
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:29,282
I'm very sorry.

347
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,650
You're sorry?

348
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:34,786
- Kate.
- No, I wanna know why.

349
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:39,314
I wanna know that Sun and Jin and
Sayid didn't die for nothing.

350
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:53,010
Come and sit down and I'll
tell you what they died for.

351
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,178
I'll tell you why I chose them...

352
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,785
And why I chose you.

353
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,978
And then I'll tell you
everything you need to know

354
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,058
about protecting this island,
because by the time

355
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,466
that fire burns out,

356
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,138
one of you is gonna have
to start doing it.

357
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:39,818
You got a minute?

358
00:28:40,467 --> 00:28:41,906
Mr. Locke. Yes.

359
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:43,906
Yes, come on in.

360
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,186
Is that your son?

361
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:55,874
Yes. That's, uh, last Thanksgiving.

362
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:57,802
He looks just like you.

363
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,018
Don't tell him that.

364
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,890
So what can I do for you, Mr. Locke?

365
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,851
Dr. Shephard, you and I were
on the same plane from Sydney.

366
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,929
You gave me your card, and...

367
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:20,155
next day, I threw it away. No offense.

368
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,580
None taken.

369
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:23,346
Anyway...

370
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:26,801
Then a few days later, I get hit by a car.

371
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:28,930
And of all the doctors in Los Angeles,

372
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,257
I ended up with you.

373
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:34,505
Then a... after you saved my life,

374
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,674
you still wanna fix me, and I still...

375
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,826
Don't wanna be fixed.

376
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:42,457
Okay.

377
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:43,658
Then...

378
00:29:45,114 --> 00:29:47,146
the man who ran me down

379
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:50,282
shows up at my school today again.

380
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,106
He beat up a teacher in the parking lot.

381
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:55,067
But do you know what he said to him?

382
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,666
He said that he wasn't there to hurt me.

383
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:00,946
He was there to help me "let go,"

384
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,938
which is exactly the same thing
that you said to me

385
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:07,001
the last time you and I saw each other.

386
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:11,442
I'm sorry. Are... are you saying

387
00:30:11,554 --> 00:30:13,849
that I sent this man to run you down?

388
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:15,610
No. No, no. No, no, no.

389
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,385
But... but what if all this...

390
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,546
maybe this is happening for a reason.

391
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,289
Maybe you're supposed to fix me.

392
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:31,642
Mr. Locke, I want to fix you,

393
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:35,745
but I think you're mistaking
coincidence for fate.

394
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:38,169
You can call it whatever you want,
but here I am,

395
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:40,089
and I...

396
00:30:44,699 --> 00:30:47,002
I think I'm ready to
get out of this chair.

397
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,369
I don't really know where to start.

398
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:00,929
How about with why you
brought us to the island?

399
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:07,994
I brought all of you here
because I made a mistake.

400
00:31:10,857 --> 00:31:12,770
A mistake I made a very long time ago,

401
00:31:12,978 --> 00:31:14,113
and now because of that,

402
00:31:14,265 --> 00:31:16,769
there's a very good chance that
every single one of you

403
00:31:17,362 --> 00:31:19,786
and every you've ever cared
about is going to die.

404
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:21,497
What mistake?

405
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,426
You call him "the monster."

406
00:31:28,434 --> 00:31:30,890
But I'm responsible for
what happened to him.

407
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,809
I made him that way.

408
00:31:35,434 --> 00:31:36,546
And ever since then,

409
00:31:37,368 --> 00:31:38,842
he's been trying to kill me.

410
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,786
It was only a matter of time
before he figured out how,

411
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:46,562
and when he did,
someone would have to replace me.

412
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,506
And that's why I brought you all here.

413
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,154
Tell me something, Jacob.

414
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,075
Why do I gotta be
punished for your mistake?

415
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,241
What made you think you
can mess with my life?

416
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:01,314
I was doin' just fine

417
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:04,130
- till you dragged my ass to this damn rock.
- No, you weren't.

418
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:09,482
None of you were.

419
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:14,242
I didn't pluck any of you out
of a happy existence.

420
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,107
You were all flawed.

421
00:32:21,682 --> 00:32:24,514
I chose you because you were like me.

422
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,289
You were all alone.

423
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:29,457
You were all looking for something

424
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:31,417
that you couldn't find out there.

425
00:32:33,186 --> 00:32:36,850
I chose you because you needed this
place as much as it needed you.

426
00:32:37,802 --> 00:32:40,106
Why did you cross my
name off of your wall?

427
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,770
Because you became a mother.

428
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,170
It's just a line of chalk in a cave.

429
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:48,235
The job is yours if you want it, Kate.

430
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,098
What is the job?

431
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,146
There's a light at the
center of the island.

432
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:03,146
You have to make sure it never goes out.

433
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,337
That's how you protect it.

434
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,770
Your monster friend said there
was nothing to protect it from.

435
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,074
You have to protect it from him.

436
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,410
You must do what I couldn't...

437
00:33:18,682 --> 00:33:21,314
- What I wasn't able to do.
- You want us to kill him.

438
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,297
- Is that even possible?
- I hope so,

439
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:32,122
because he is certainly
going to try to kill you.

440
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,586
So...

441
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,082
How you gonna pick?

442
00:33:43,217 --> 00:33:45,186
I'm not going to pick, Hugo.

443
00:33:46,618 --> 00:33:49,786
I want you to have the one
thing that I was never given...

444
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:51,858
a choice.

445
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,209
And if none of us chooses it?

446
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:56,802
Then this ends very badly.

447
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,641
I'll do it.

448
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,530
This is why I'm here.

449
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:14,425
This is...

450
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,105
this is what I'm supposed to do.

451
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,330
Is that a question, Jack?

452
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,714
No.

453
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,074
Good.

454
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:35,122
Then it's time.

455
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:48,049
And I thought that guy
had a God complex before.

456
00:34:49,026 --> 00:34:50,090
James.

457
00:34:50,345 --> 00:34:51,422
Yeah, I know.

458
00:34:54,646 --> 00:34:56,185
I'm just glad it's not me.

459
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:02,890
Do you remember that bamboo field you
woke up in when you first got here?

460
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:05,345
Yeah.

461
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,049
Beyond that field, across a ridge,

462
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:09,601
is the heart of the island.

463
00:35:10,498 --> 00:35:12,066
That's where the light is.

464
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,129
That's where he's trying to go.

465
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:19,330
And that's what you have to protect.

466
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:21,002
Past the bamboo?

467
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,298
There's nothing out there.

468
00:35:23,698 --> 00:35:25,089
Yes, there is, Jack.

469
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:28,305
And now you'll be able to get there.

470
00:35:36,722 --> 00:35:37,897
Do you have a cup?

471
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,857
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.

472
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:06,941
Drink this.

473
00:36:14,742 --> 00:36:16,908
How long am I gonna have to do this job?

474
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,405
As long as you can.

475
00:36:51,965 --> 00:36:53,469
Now you're like me.

476
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:13,461
All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume.

477
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,717
This little lady next door is Austen.

478
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,352
It's been real nice having y'all...

479
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:18,615
But you're shipping off to county,

480
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:21,672
so best of luck and vaya con dios.

481
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:28,977
You could still let me go.

482
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:30,840
Why the hell would I do that?

483
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,984
Because I told you I was innocent,

484
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:36,480
and you believed me.

485
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:37,640
Doesn't matter.

486
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,047
Still can't let you go. I'm a cop.

487
00:37:41,608 --> 00:37:43,232
You don't seem like a cop to me.

488
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:46,719
Nice knowing

489
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,069
1-F-21 responding.

490
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,070
I think it's time to leave.

491
00:38:04,302 --> 00:38:06,428
- What?
- I said, I think it's time to leave.

492
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,406
Are you ready to get out of here?

493
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:13,045
- I'm sorry. Who are you?
- He's a crazy person who turned himself in.

494
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:16,477
- What'd you turn yourself in for?
- I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.

495
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:18,260
You see what I mean?

496
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,773
All right. I'm crazy.

497
00:38:22,141 --> 00:38:23,852
But do you want to get out of here or not?

498
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:27,253
So, what, are you just gonna
tell the driver to stop?

499
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:30,061
The driver already knows where to stop.
But when that happens,

500
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:31,668
you're gonna have to give me your trust.

501
00:38:32,188 --> 00:38:34,525
- Our trust?
- That's right.

502
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:36,437
Because after I set you free,

503
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,749
I'm gonna ask each of you to do something,

504
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:42,741
and you're gonna have to
promise me that you'll do it.

505
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,772
- So what do you say?
- Oh, absolutely, I promise.

506
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:51,173
How about you?

507
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:52,701
Okay. Sure.

508
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:53,773
All right, then.

509
00:39:07,805 --> 00:39:08,780
Who's Hume?

510
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:11,526
- That's me.
- Where's your friend with my money?

511
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:12,611
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to say

512
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,118
- I shot all of you trying to escape.
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

513
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,021
Oh, here he comes.

514
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,693
- Sorry I'm late, dude.
- Don't worry about it.

515
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:46,526
- Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Ana
Lucia was gonna be here.
- Do I know you, tubby?

516
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:49,637
Oh. No. We never met.

517
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,933
Anyways, here's your money.

518
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,412
125 grand, right?

519
00:39:53,677 --> 00:39:54,725
Yeah, that's right.

520
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,597
Nice not knowing you.

521
00:40:01,336 --> 00:40:03,492
- She's not coming with us?
- No, she's not ready yet.

522
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:04,908
I brought you my Camaro.

523
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:05,893
The keys are under the floor mat.

524
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,101
- Everything else you need's in the trunk.
- All right, good.

525
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:09,828
Um, you know where
you're taking 'em, yeah?

526
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,189
- Absolutely.
- All right, well, we should get going.

527
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:18,685
- Okay, you're with him, and you're with me.
- What do you mean, I'm with you?

528
00:40:20,006 --> 00:40:20,901
We...

529
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,861
are going to a concert.

530
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:33,668
Let's go.

531
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:42,325
Hey, can I ask you something?

532
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,606
Shoot.

533
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:48,076
If you can turn yourself
into smoke whenever you want,

534
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,141
why do you bother walking?

535
00:40:51,164 --> 00:40:53,190
I like the feel of my feet on the ground.

536
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,557
Reminds me that I was human.

537
00:40:57,526 --> 00:40:58,510
We're here.

538
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:09,933
Are you thirsty?

539
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,430
This is the well I threw
Desmond Hume into.

540
00:41:17,612 --> 00:41:18,572
What's the matter?

541
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,902
I sent Sayid to kill Desmond.

542
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,708
Obviously, he didn't.

543
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,156
Looks like someone helped him out.

544
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,446
No, Ben. Someone helped me out.

545
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,982
What did Widmore say to you?

546
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:48,140
He said Desmond was a fail-safe.

547
00:41:48,828 --> 00:41:51,252
Jacob's last resort in case, God forbid,

548
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:53,660
I managed to kill all of
his beloved candidates...

549
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:57,253
one final way to make sure
that I never leave this place.

550
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,261
Then... why are you happy
that he's still alive?

551
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:04,717
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

552
00:42:05,902 --> 00:42:07,725
And when I do, he's gonna help me

553
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:10,893
do the one thing that I
could never do myself.

554
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,508
I'm gonna destroy the island.

555
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:19,224
