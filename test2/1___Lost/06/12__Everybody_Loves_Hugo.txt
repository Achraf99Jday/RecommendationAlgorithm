1
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:13,263
I don't like secrets.

2
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,439
You told me you brought
me here to the island

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,487
to do something very important.
When do we start?

4
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:23,919
Run.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,097
These people are
extremely dangerous.

6
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,136
We need to go now.

7
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:31,818
Lead the way. This man
wants to leave the island,

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,769
and that plane's the
only way he can do it.

9
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:35,481
Do you wanna know where we're going?
We're gonna stop him.

10
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,704
How are you gonna stop him from getting
on that plane? We have to destroy it.

11
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:43,178
<i>In a world of conflict
and strife,</i>

12
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,532
<i>there is but one fact we
all can agree upon...</i>

13
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:51,145
<i>everybody loves Hugo.</i>

14
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:54,369
<i>Born to humble surroundings,</i>

15
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:56,971
<i>Hugo Reyes has always been
a beacon of light</i>

16
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:58,947
<i>for all who crossed his path.</i>

17
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>Hugo's lifelong love
affair with chicken</i>

18
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:07,081
<i>led him to acquire and then expand the Mr.
Cluck's chain</i>

19
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:09,141
<i>into a worldwide phenomenon.</i>

20
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:11,872
<i>The exponential growth
of Hugo's success</i>

21
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,069
<i>was startling.</i>

22
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:16,470
<i>But financial success
wasn't the end,</i>

23
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,750
<i>it was the beginning.</i>

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,599
<i>Hugo and giving</i>

25
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,438
<i>became synonymous...</i>

26
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,039
<i>parks...</i>

27
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,999
<i>Playgrounds...</i>

28
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,190
<i>Hospitals...</i>

29
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,798
<i>The Mr. Cluck's house
for children.</i>

30
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:35,030
<i>The philanthropy was
unparalleled...</i>

31
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,104
Which brings us to this evening

32
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:40,983
and the opening of the Hugo
Reyes paleontology wing

33
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:44,088
at the golden state
natural history museum...

34
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,503
a lasting beacon of culture

35
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:47,879
that bears the name

36
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:50,712
of one of our city's
greatest benefactors.

37
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,886
Ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,902
our man of the year...

39
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:58,655
Hugo Reyes!

40
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:19,393
It's a pretty cool trophy, huh?

41
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,114
Mm-hmm, Hugo. Oh,
you know we got the human fund

42
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,844
next Saturday night.
Can you make it?

43
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,622
Another trophy?

44
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,178
<i>Everybody loves Hugo.</i>

45
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,442
You know who doesn't?

46
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,202
Women.

47
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:33,783
Ma!

48
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:35,630
You need a woman in your life,

49
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:38,486
especially one who
has not nursed you.

50
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,814
That's disgusting.

51
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:42,463
And I'm too busy to meet someone.

52
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:45,024
You're not too busy.
You're too scared.

53
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,330
I'm not scared.

54
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,321
Good, because you have
a date tomorrow.

55
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:50,171
I do?

56
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,852
Grandpa tito's neighbor's
daughter, Rosalita.

57
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,079
She agreed to lunch with you.

58
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,678
What's she like?

59
00:02:58,102 --> 00:03:00,317
Willing to meet you.
Ma.

60
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,489
You're going!

61
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,551
She's gonna love you.

62
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,246
And if she doesn't,

63
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,197
we will find someone who does.

64
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,904
A lot of crazy stuff's
been happening.

65
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,478
I kinda wish I could talk
to you about it in person.

66
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,963
A lot of people have come to
talk to me after they've...

67
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:43,644
You know, gone.

68
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,877
It would be nice
if you could, too.

69
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,342
Hugo?

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,416
You ready to go?

71
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:53,944
Once I'm back, we're leaving.

72
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,975
Where you going?
"The black rock."

73
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,418
If we're gonna destroy that plane,
we'll need dynamite.

74
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,575
You sure that's the right move?

75
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,392
No. But it's the
only move we have.

76
00:04:06,804 --> 00:04:09,155
Well, you're the expert.

77
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:12,153
Whose grave is this?

78
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,252
Her name was Libby.

79
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:17,220
She was in the tail
section of the plane.

80
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:20,377
We were gonna have our first date.

81
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,153
It was gonna be, like, a picnic.

82
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,014
But...

83
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:30,330
Then she was murdered.

84
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:33,960
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,481
Yeah, me, too.

86
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,452
Hey.

87
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,431
What are you doing here?

88
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,302
I'm here to stop you from
getting everyone killed.

89
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:19,625

www.Addic7ed.Com

90
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,838
you gonna say something?

91
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:35,439
Why should I trust you?

92
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:37,449
You murdered Libby and Ana Lucia.

93
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,815
That doesn't matter right now.

94
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,029
What matters is you
going across the island

95
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:43,975
to blow up that plane?
People are gonna die...

96
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:46,366
a lot of people,
and it's gonna be your fault.

97
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:47,727
What?

98
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,414
Because people are listening
to you now, Hurley.

99
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,388
Hurley.

100
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:57,705
Who are you talking to?

101
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:58,529
Um...

102
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:02,427
No one.

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,971
Come on.

104
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,299
We're leaving.

105
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:22,527
Can I get you some more
homemade tortilla chips?

106
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:25,583
Sure. Whatever.

107
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:28,774
Uh, can you leave those?

108
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,191
I'm meeting someone.

109
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,025
She's running late.

110
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,424
Right. Chips are on the way.

111
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,176
Hugo?

112
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,180
Uh, hi.

113
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,597
Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,025
Wow.

115
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,725
Uh, I wasn't expecting
someone like you.

116
00:06:58,061 --> 00:06:59,466
Uh, I'm sorry?

117
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,984
You know, someone who's so...

118
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:03,158
Pretty.

119
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:07,945
Please. H-have a seat.

120
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,344
You don't look like a Rosalita.

121
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,505
Oh. Um, my name isn't Rosalita.

122
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,540
I-it's Libby.

123
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,675
So... you're not my blind date?

124
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,718
No, I-I just saw you
from across the room.

125
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:28,655
Well, how'd you know my name?

126
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:33,588
Well, if I tell you,
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

127
00:07:33,924 --> 00:07:35,355
No, I won't.

128
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,320
Hugo,

129
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,365
do you believe that two
people can be connected,

130
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:51,459
like soul mates?

131
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,414
I guess.

132
00:07:58,932 --> 00:08:00,902
You don't remember me, do you?

133
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:03,953
Should I?

134
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,349
What are you doing, Elizabeth?

135
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,815
Are you bothering this man?

136
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,339
No. No, he... he's an old friend.

137
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,664
Actually, we just... wait.
What's... what's going on?

138
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,882
I apologize for the intrusion. Come on.
No, Dr. Brooks, if I could just...

139
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,084
Doctor? I'm sorry.
She just wandered off.

140
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,249
Wandered off from where?

141
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,481
Everything that I said, Hugo,

142
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:24,880
I meant it.

143
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:28,569
Forgive us.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,205
Yeah, just four of us.

145
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:03,433
All right, let's go.

146
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,122
We have to make it
to the outriggers

147
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,523
and across the channel to hydra island
before nightfall.

148
00:09:07,643 --> 00:09:08,714
You have the dynamite?

149
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,874
Four sticks...

150
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:13,421
enough to destroy the cockpit
and all the instruments.

151
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,560
That plane'll never fly.

152
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,208
Um, I don't know if
that's a good idea.

153
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,939
I mean, for one thing,
that stuff's really unstable.

154
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:24,410
You have to trust me. I've been
training my whole life for this.

155
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,565
To blow stuff up? To protect you.

156
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:28,643
Yeah, but how is blowing
up the plane protecting us?

157
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:30,952
With that plane gone,

158
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,838
<i>that thing won't be able to leave the island.
</i>

159
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,491
Yeah, well, neither will we,

160
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,004
and then we'll be
stuck here with it,

161
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:39,500
and it'll be angry at us.
Jacob said Richard would know what to do.

162
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,362
And Richard said to blow
up the plane. Correct?

163
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:43,265
Yes.

164
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:46,257
Well, Jacob never said
anything about it to me.

165
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:49,214
I mean, what if Richard's wrong?

166
00:09:49,334 --> 00:09:52,620
Hugo, I'm looking out for your
best interests, all of you.

167
00:09:53,065 --> 00:09:54,893
Nothing is more
important than this.

168
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:56,811
That thing is evil,

169
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,724
and God help us if it ever
leaves this island, bec...

170
00:10:15,317 --> 00:10:17,633
about six feet off the ground.

171
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:19,226
That gonna be a spear?

172
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:24,029
I'm not sure what it's
gonna be yet, James.

173
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,212
When the time is right,
it'll tell me.

174
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:29,278
You talk to wood now? Sawyer.

175
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:30,562
What?

176
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,187
Something I can do for you two?

177
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,866
Is there something you can do?
How about anything?

178
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,152
Those bastards on the
other island grabbed Jin.

179
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,943
We're just sitting around
twiddlin' our damn thumbs,

180
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:43,805
doin' nothin' about it.

181
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:47,662
There's a difference between
doing nothing and waiting.

182
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,106
So what are we waiting for?

183
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:55,913
You were only able to
come back to this island

184
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,439
because you all did it together.

185
00:10:58,099 --> 00:10:59,735
If we're gonna get on
that plane and leave,

186
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:01,277
it has to happen the same way.

187
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,471
We're waing for your
friends to get here, Kate...

188
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,282
Hugo, sun, Jack...

189
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:08,955
that's the only way

190
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:12,823
we're ever getting off
this godforsaken rock.

191
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,230
Well, I don't see that happening.
Well, let's just hope you're wrong.

192
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,556
Where you been?

193
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,530
Can I speak to you in private?

194
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,329
Absolutely.

195
00:11:50,766 --> 00:11:52,430
Everything go all right?

196
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:53,605
Yes.

197
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,262
Did Widmore see you?

198
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:58,946
No, but his people did.
And you let them live?

199
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,634
I didn't see the point of killing them
when I had what I came for.

200
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,879
So you found
what they were hiding in the submarine?

201
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,204
I most certainly did.

202
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:53,379
Now what?

203
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,289
We get me dynamite or
else she died for nothing.

204
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,076
Maybe she died to show us to stay
the hell away from dynamite.

205
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,255
Well,
Jack, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

206
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,378
Richard, I promised sun that
I'd get her off this island.

207
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,559
Well, Jack, I-I wish
you hadn't done that.

208
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,685
If it makes you feel any better, you can
blame it on me.

209
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,102
I think Richard's right.

210
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,071
It's the only choice we've got.

211
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,260
Trust me, Jack.

212
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,752
Okay.

213
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,920
Good. Let's get moving.

214
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:40,429
38? Number 38?

215
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:43,833
Mr. Reyes!

216
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,070
What an honor.

217
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,496
Give me a bucket, family size.

218
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,471
Of course. Right away, sir.

219
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:52,561
41?

220
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,346
Number 41?

221
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:02,674
What?

222
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,325
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,042
Have I seen you before?

224
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,534
I own the place.
Maybe you saw my commercial.

225
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:16,192
You want a Clucketeer keychain?

226
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:18,438
N-no. It's not that.

227
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,662
Were you on oceanic flight 815?

228
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:26,797
About a week ago, from Sydney?
Uh, yeah.

229
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,591
So was I. Wow. What a coincidence.

230
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,354
Yeah. Listen, you mind if I join
you while I wait for my order?

231
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,553
Be my guest.

232
00:14:35,673 --> 00:14:37,319
Ooh. That is a lot of chicken.

233
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:41,880
I eat when I'm depressed.
Ah. So what's her name?

234
00:14:43,754 --> 00:14:45,664
I met a girl on a blind
date the other night.

235
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,574
And you didn't-
it didn't go how you'd hoped?

236
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:50,240
Mm. She was totally awesome,

237
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,535
expect for one thing- she's crazy.

238
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,150
Well, all women are a
little bit crazy, brother.

239
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,694
No. This one actually
lives in the looney bin.

240
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,733
I mean, I saw the van.
She's full-on nuts.

241
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:04,541
I mean, she started sane,

242
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:07,542
but then she told me that
we already knew each other...

243
00:15:07,662 --> 00:15:09,967
<i>and that? I'd remember.</i>

244
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:14,640
Tell me something...

245
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,899
did you believe her when
she said she knew you?

246
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:22,905
Yeah.

247
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:25,602
Kinda.

248
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:28,409
You know, I say go with your gut.

249
00:15:30,198 --> 00:15:31,855
You know, maybe you should...

250
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:35,364
You should try to find out where
she thinks she knew you from

251
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,256
before you give up on her.

252
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,077
42? Order 42?

253
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,867
Ah, that's me, brother.

254
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,414
Well...

255
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,494
Uh...

256
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:51,226
It was nice bumping into you.

257
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,354
Hello.

258
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,402
Hello.

259
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:05,975
I'm sorry Sayid tied you up,

260
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,803
but he was afraid you'd run before we
had a chance to talk.

261
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:10,016
I don't blame him.

262
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:12,114
Although as I explained
to him before he left,

263
00:16:14,003 --> 00:16:15,757
<i>i have nowhere to run to,
brother.</i>

264
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:21,946
Well, if that's not the best argument
against captivity that I've ever heard,

265
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,027
I don't know what is.

266
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,196
You mind if I ask you a
couple questions, Desmond?

267
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,012
Not at all.

268
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:43,291
Why did Charles Widmore bring
you back to the island?

269
00:16:44,283 --> 00:16:45,913
Considering I was kidnapped,

270
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,384
you'd have to ask him.

271
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,825
They had him under armed guard.

272
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:55,976
He threw me into a wood shack

273
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:59,600
and blasted me with a massive
amount of electromagnetism.

274
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,241
If you don't mind my asking,
Desmond,

275
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,446
how can you be sure what it
was that he blasted you with?

276
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:08,697
Experience.

277
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,687
Do you know who I am?

278
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,656
Of course.

279
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,136
You're John Locke.

280
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,272
Head back to camp.
I'll be back soon.

281
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:30,885
Where are you going?

282
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,772
Desmond and I need to take a walk.

283
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:41,937
Something I'd like to show you.

284
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,417
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?

285
00:17:54,017 --> 00:17:54,921
What's that?

286
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:56,208
Ilana.

287
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,112
There she was,

288
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:01,049
handpicked by Jacob,

289
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:05,137
trained to come and
protect you candidates.

290
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:09,649
No sooner does she
tell you who you are,

291
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,785
then she blows up.

292
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,835
The island was done with her.

293
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:21,600
Makes me wonder what's gonna
happen when it's done with us.

294
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:44,371
All right, everyone.
This might take a few minutes.

295
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,970
I don't want anyone but
me handling that dynamite,

296
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,268
so I'm gonna go in alone.

297
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,045
Where's Hugo?

298
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:52,936
I thought he was up front with you.
Run!

299
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,878
Run!

300
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:57,582
Go! Go! Go! Go!

301
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,552
Why the hell did you do that?!

302
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,608
I'm protecting us.

303
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,440
What the hell were you thinking?!
Calm down.

304
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,644
Now what... what are we supposed
to do now?

305
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:31,777
That's it. That's enough.

306
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:32,901
We're dead. We're all dead.

307
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,488
A warning might have
been nice there, Hugo.

308
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,873
I did say "run."

309
00:19:46,497 --> 00:19:47,968
Why'd you do that?

310
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,513
Michael told me to.

311
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,241
Who?

312
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:53,486
Michael.

313
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,960
He's one of the
people who come back

314
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,534
and yell at me after they die.

315
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,646
He told me I had to stop everyone

316
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,912
from blowing up the plane.

317
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:04,835
So... no dynamite,
no more blowing up.

318
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:07,622
That happen a lot,

319
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,568
dead people yelling at you?

320
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,088
It happens enough.

321
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:15,597
And you just listen
to whatever they say?

322
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:19,609
Dead people are more
reliable than alive people.

323
00:20:22,828 --> 00:20:24,899
How can I help you, Mr. Reyes?

324
00:20:26,127 --> 00:20:29,305
I wanted to ask you about
that girl the other day.

325
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:30,982
Libby?

326
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:34,905
I was wondering if
maybe I could see her.

327
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,239
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

328
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:39,594
She's not well.

329
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:41,259
Clearly, she's well enough

330
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:44,376
for, like, a... fajita field trip.

331
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,153
Well, that's my mistake.

332
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:48,426
I misjudged her condition.

333
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,857
Her condition?

334
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,632
She has issues with reality.

335
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,193
What do you mean?

336
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:58,809
I just think it probably
wouldn't be a good idea

337
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:00,146
for you to see her right now.

338
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:02,347
It'll only confuse her.

339
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,765
You said "probably,"

340
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:06,119
which means you might
make an exception.

341
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:08,387
Well, perhaps for family.

342
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:11,276
Or a generous donor?

343
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,331
I'm sorry?

344
00:21:17,378 --> 00:21:19,949
The rec room looked pretty
gnarly on my way in.

345
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:23,002
What do you think 100k might buy?

346
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:52,046
You remembered?

347
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,419
No.

348
00:21:55,236 --> 00:21:56,905
I'm sorry.

349
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,561
Then why are you here?

350
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:05,347
Where is it you think
you know me from?

351
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,611
Um, I'm not sure. I...

352
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,809
I know it won't make sense.

353
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:14,311
Try me.

354
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,868
A few days ago, I was watching tv,

355
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:25,047
and one of your
commercials came on.

356
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,533
And the moment that I saw you,

357
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:29,507
it was like I was
hit over the head.

358
00:22:29,538 --> 00:22:31,474
All these memories

359
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:34,388
came washing back... of my life,

360
00:22:34,508 --> 00:22:37,427
only... it was...

361
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:41,693
<i>Another life.</i>

362
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:45,267
What kind of memories?

363
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,242
There was a plane crash.

364
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:53,498
And...

365
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:56,001
I was on an island.

366
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,352
And I was there?

367
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:03,388
I think so. We... knew each other.

368
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,171
We...

369
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:07,116
Liked each other.

370
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,048
And then when I got here,

371
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:14,385
it was almost like
I'd been here before.

372
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,530
And for some reason, Hugo,

373
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,401
I have a memory of
you being here, too.

374
00:23:21,121 --> 00:23:22,436
Um...

375
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,199
This is the first time I've
ever been in a mental hospital.

376
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:28,310
Yeah, I know. But I can't
get you out of my brain.

377
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,343
That's why the other night when I saw you,
I had to talk to you,

378
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:34,995
because if you remembered me...

379
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,004
I wish I could, Libby, but...

380
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,000
I can't.

381
00:23:47,868 --> 00:23:48,805
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,416
It's okay.

383
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,623
It's okay.

384
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:56,168
I'm crazy.

385
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:57,944
Yeah, probably, but...

386
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,612
We all got something, right?

387
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:03,570
I mean, it takes a lot of guts

388
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:06,411
to go up to a total stranger
and tell them you know them

389
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:09,886
from some bizarro
alternate universe.

390
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,272
I'm scared just
saying "hi" to a girl.

391
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,889
You're doing fine.

392
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:32,369
Hey, can you ever, like...

393
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,484
Get outta here?

394
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:37,086
On a day pass or...

395
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:39,897
Yeah. I'm here voluntarily.

396
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:42,093
Well...

397
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:45,115
Would you like to...

398
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,200
Do something?

399
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:49,222
You mean...

400
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:52,337
A date?

401
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:54,439
Uh...

402
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,534
Yeah.

403
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,433
I'd love that.

404
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,358
Remind me, Desmond...

405
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:10,959
how long were you down in that hatch,
pushing that button?

406
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:12,526
Three years.

407
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,720
And here you are, back for more.

408
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:19,003
If I didn't know better,
I'd say this island has it in for you.

409
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:20,505
<i>Do you know better?</i>

410
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:21,744
Excuse me?

411
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:23,695
Well, there's nothing
special about me, brother.

412
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:26,651
This island has it
in for all of us.

413
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,378
Yes, it does.

414
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,450
What?

415
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:35,428
Who's that?

416
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,071
Just ignore him.

417
00:25:42,984 --> 00:25:45,675
Do you know that boy?
I said ignore him.

418
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:58,090
Where you going?

419
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:01,045
Ben, back at the dharma barracks...

420
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:03,106
there's still grenades there?
Explosives?

421
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:06,421
Yes, I think so.
Then that's where we're going.

422
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:10,064
Maybe we should talk about this a minute.
Talk? There's no time to talk,

423
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,223
but if you know what we need to do,
if you know how we stop that thing

424
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:15,163
from leaving the island
without blowing that plane up,

425
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,685
then let's hear it. Let's all hear it.
I know what we need to do.

426
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,107
Really? What's that?

427
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:23,839
We have to go talk to Locke.

428
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,425
Are you trying to get us killed?

429
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,777
It's not my idea.

430
00:26:28,014 --> 00:26:29,768
It's his.

431
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:37,545
Jacob says we have
to talk to Locke.

432
00:26:37,833 --> 00:26:39,634
- Jacob's here right now?
- Yeah.

433
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,862
Ask him what the island is.

434
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:49,084
What?

435
00:26:49,877 --> 00:26:51,939
A while back, Jacob told
me what the island was,

436
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:54,227
and if he's really standing here
right next to me, then just ask him.

437
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,093
I don't have to prove
anything to you, Richard.

438
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,036
You either come with me

439
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,111
or you can keep trying
to blow stuff up.

440
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:17,664
Your call, dude.

441
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:24,657
He's lying.

442
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:26,848
Jacob isn't telling us what to do

443
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:28,620
<i>because Jacob never tells
us what to do.</i>

444
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,013
I'm gonna make this simple...

445
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:33,510
if that thing leaves the island, that's it.
I-it's over.

446
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:35,324
- What's over?
- Everything.

447
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:36,982
I'm destroying that plane,

448
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,576
and I can use all
the help I can get.

449
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:41,690
Who's coming with me?

450
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:48,095
I am.

451
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,663
I saw that thing in action, man.
It doesn't want to talk.

452
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:01,386
Sorry.

453
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,184
Anyone else?

454
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,390
Sorry, Richard.

455
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,026
If Jacob says we go talk to Locke,
we go talk to Locke.

456
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,348
- I'm going with Hugo.
- Really?

457
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:23,458
Don't get in our way.

458
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,351
All right, Hurley.

459
00:28:32,983 --> 00:28:34,487
Let's go talk to Locke.

460
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,502
Probably.

461
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,400
So what do you think we should...

462
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:05,278
Say to Locke when we get there?

463
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,319
I mean...

464
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,407
How do you break the ice
with the smoke monster?

465
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,534
Don't worry about it.

466
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:16,047
Something tells me he's gonna
do most of the talking.

467
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,985
Or he could just kill us all.

468
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,534
Yeah, he could.

469
00:29:23,955 --> 00:29:25,934
I didn't see Jacob back there.

470
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,284
Uh, I just said it 'cause I
wanted everyone to listen to me.

471
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:32,863
I know.

472
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:34,885
Then why'd you come with me?

473
00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:38,966
Ever since Juliet died,

474
00:29:40,271 --> 00:29:41,895
ever since I got her killed,

475
00:29:43,502 --> 00:29:45,304
all I've wanted was to fix it.

476
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,830
But I can't.

477
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:51,400
I can't ever fix it.

478
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,895
You have no idea how hard
it is for me to sit back

479
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:59,255
and listen to other people
tell me what I should do.

480
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:02,666
But I think maybe
that's the point.

481
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,910
Maybe...

482
00:30:06,498 --> 00:30:08,204
<i>Maybe I'm supposed to let go.</i>

483
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:14,085
Unless you letting
go gets us killed.

484
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,184
Going to see Locke was my idea,

485
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:19,162
not Jacob's.

486
00:30:21,915 --> 00:30:23,687
Hurley, you asked me to trust you.

487
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:27,206
This is me trusting you.

488
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:30,021
Well, it's a good
thing you do, dude, cause...

489
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,972
I have no idea where I'm going.

490
00:30:41,028 --> 00:30:44,487
Wait. It's cool. I think I
know what these things are.

491
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:47,634
Oh, yeah? What the hell are they?

492
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,567
Wait here.

493
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,469
Hey. You around?

494
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,836
Michael?

495
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,401
You're stuck on the island,
aren't you?

496
00:31:16,096 --> 00:31:17,813
Because of what I did.

497
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,541
And...

498
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,997
There are others out here...

499
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:24,221
Like you, aren't there?

500
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,626
That's what the whispers are?

501
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:29,807
Yeah.

502
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:32,545
We're the ones who can't move on.

503
00:31:38,716 --> 00:31:40,423
Do you know where Locke is?

504
00:31:42,561 --> 00:31:44,041
There.

505
00:31:47,355 --> 00:31:48,932
Thanks.

506
00:31:50,274 --> 00:31:51,477
Is...

507
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:56,241
Is there anything I
can do to help you?

508
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:58,500
Don't get yourself killed.

509
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,239
Okay.

510
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:06,442
And, Hurley?

511
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:12,068
If you ever do see Libby again...

512
00:32:18,242 --> 00:32:20,758
Tell her I'm very sorry.

513
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:26,070
I'll be sure and do that, dude.

514
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:37,221
I got, like, six different
kinds of cheeses.

515
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:38,290
I don't even know what they are,

516
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,141
but the lady at the store
said they were good, so...

517
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:42,778
I figured you'd like cheese because...

518
00:32:43,847 --> 00:32:45,913
Everybody likes cheese.

519
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:53,158
Is something wrong?

520
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:54,816
No, not wrong, just...

521
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,136
Off.

522
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:01,186
Have you been here before?

523
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:02,280
No.

524
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:07,975
It's just... being here with
you feels so familiar.

525
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:11,283
It's like a date we never had.

526
00:33:13,926 --> 00:33:17,149
Wow. I sound completely
insane, don't I?

527
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:18,877
No.

528
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,757
Not completely.

529
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:24,247
Why do you even wanna be with me?

530
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,629
Why you wanna be with me?

531
00:33:28,168 --> 00:33:29,429
What?

532
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:31,736
Come on. Look at me.

533
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:35,517
I want to be with you...

534
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,869
Because I like you.

535
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:41,751
Yeah, but...

536
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,531
You like me because...

537
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,019
Well, you're... delusional.

538
00:34:08,749 --> 00:34:10,380
What? What's wrong?

539
00:34:14,563 --> 00:34:15,772
Whoa.

540
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,356
- Dude.
- What?

541
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:26,534
I...

542
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:29,541
I think I'm remembering stuff.

543
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,186
You are?

544
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:38,763
You mean I'm not crazy?

545
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,102
No, I don't think you are.

546
00:35:08,432 --> 00:35:09,703
We're here.

547
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,240
What is it?

548
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,734
It's a well.

549
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,756
Let me guess...

550
00:35:35,876 --> 00:35:37,460
you're wondering how deep it is.

551
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,528
You read my mind.

552
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:52,473
You have any idea how old
this well is, Desmond?

553
00:35:53,132 --> 00:35:54,703
Very old?

554
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,992
That's exactly right. Very old.

555
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:02,175
So old, in fact, that...

556
00:36:02,724 --> 00:36:04,581
The people who dug this well

557
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:07,214
did it completely by hand.

558
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,430
God knows how long it took 'em.

559
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,402
Well, it seems like a lot of
work just to get some water.

560
00:36:12,522 --> 00:36:14,168
Oh, they weren't
looking for water.

561
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:17,078
They were looking for answers.

562
00:36:17,944 --> 00:36:18,929
A long time ago,

563
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,164
places like the one we're
standing at right now

564
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,211
made compass needles spin.

565
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,481
And the people
holding the compasses

566
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,995
needed to know why,

567
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,713
so they dug.

568
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:34,672
Did they find what
they were looking for?

569
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,856
No, they didn't.

570
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:42,028
The reason I wanted you
to see this, Desmond,

571
00:36:42,291 --> 00:36:44,263
is because Charles Widmore

572
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:46,622
is not interested in answers.

573
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:48,640
He's only interested in power.

574
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:51,091
And he brought you
back to this island

575
00:36:51,146 --> 00:36:54,369
so that you could help him
find what he's looking for.

576
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:57,321
After all,
this isn't the only well.

577
00:36:59,829 --> 00:37:01,727
And that's the reason

578
00:37:02,758 --> 00:37:04,904
you wanted me to see this?

579
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,728
Why aren't you afraid?

580
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:12,027
Excuse me?

581
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:15,123
You're out here,

582
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:17,253
middle of the jungle,

583
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:18,963
with me.

584
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,457
Not a person on earth
even knows you're here.

585
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:24,471
Why aren't you afraid?

586
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,860
What is the point in being afraid?

587
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,311
Aah!

588
00:37:51,848 --> 00:37:53,325
How is our friend?

589
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:56,581
We don't have to worry
about him anymore.

590
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,509
<i>Where you been?</i>

591
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,567
I went for a walk, James.

592
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:11,095
Well, now that you've stretched
your legs, maybe you can...

593
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,868
Son of a bitch.

594
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,907
Um... hey.

595
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:33,524
Hello, Hugo.

596
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:37,270
I don't know who you are, dude,

597
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,511
or what you want,

598
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:42,562
but we have to talk to you.

599
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:45,041
"We"?

600
00:38:46,505 --> 00:38:48,077
There are other people with me.

601
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:54,007
But the thing is,

602
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,077
you got weapons,
and we got weapons,

603
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:57,863
and I don't want
anyone to get hurt...

604
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:01,089
Or killed.

605
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,178
So we're not gonna do anything,

606
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:09,206
and I want your word that you're
not gonna do anything either.

607
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:22,033
You have my word.

608
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:29,513
Okay, guys.

609
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,777
Come on out.

610
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,843
Hello, Jack.

611
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,117
Hello there.

612
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:31,494
Are you waiting for
someone in particular?

613
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:34,034
Excuse me?

614
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:35,543
Well, I noticed you've
been parked here a while,

615
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:39,326
watching the kids, and,
well, it is a school.

616
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,377
Do you have a child who goes here?

617
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,880
No. No. I was, um,

618
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,664
uh, I just moved to
the neighborhood, and...

619
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:52,174
And, uh, I'm looking
for a school for my son.

620
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:54,071
What's your son's name?
Charlie.

621
00:40:56,113 --> 00:40:59,164
Well, as a teacher here,
I can vouch for it completely.

622
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:00,680
It's a wonderful school.

623
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:03,431
That's great to hear. Thanks.

624
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,319
Well, it was nice talking to you.

625
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,081
Have a good day.

626
00:41:27,672 --> 00:41:28,923
Oh my God!

627
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:35,352
Call 9-1-1! Do it now!

628
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:36,913
Mr. Locke?

629
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:38,871
Oh, my God.

630
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,828
Don't... don't move. We're gonna
get you to the hospital.

631
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:43,073
Mr. Locke?

632
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:45,936
Mr. Locke, can you hear me?

633
00:41:46,452 --> 00:41:52,488
