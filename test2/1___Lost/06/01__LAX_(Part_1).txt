Previously on "Lost"

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:05,266
They come. They fight.

3
00:00:05,267 --> 00:00:07,767
They destroy. They corrupt.

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:10,103
It always ends the same.

5
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:11,771
It only ends once.

6
00:00:11,772 --> 00:00:15,308
Anything that happens
before that is just progress.

7
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,317
I'm not gonna
kill jacob, ben.

8
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,172
<i>You are.</i>

9
00:00:20,173 --> 00:00:23,159
Do what I asked you to, ben,
I want you to understand
one thing.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,796
You have a choice.

11
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:35,657
they're coming.

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,394
The dharma folks
at the swan worksite--

13
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,397
They're gonna
drill into the ground

14
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:43,098
And accidentally tap into
a massive pocket of energy.

15
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:45,400
I think I can
negate that energy.

16
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:49,736
I'm gonna detonate
a hydrogen bomb.
If we can do what faraday said,
plane never crashes.

17
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,671
Flight 815
lands in los angeles.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,008
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waitin' for?!

19
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:08,187
we hit the pocket!

20
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:13,630
Aah!

21
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,899
juliet!

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,334
Aah!

23
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:20,536
I got you.
No, don't let go!
Aah!

24
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,373
<i>Juliet!</i>

25
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,675
<i>No!</i>

26
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:34,590
No! No, come on!

27
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:36,159
Come on!

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,895
Come on, you son of a bitch!

29
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,404
So how's the drink?

30
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,473
Uh...

31
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,641
It's good.

32
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:22,044
That's not
a very strong reaction.

33
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:25,013
Well, it's--it's not
a very strong drink.

34
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:30,853
Don't tell anyone.
It'll be our secret.

35
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:41,764
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:45,201
<i>The captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belts" sign.</i>

37
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:47,070
<i>Please return to your seats</i>

38
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,039
<i>And keep your seat belts
fastened.
It's normal.</i>

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,009
<i>My husband said the planes
want to stay in the air.</i>

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,845
sounds like a smart man.

41
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:56,781
You be sure and tell him that

42
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,484
When he gets back
from the bathroom.

43
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,687
Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

44
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,590
Don't worry, it'll be...

45
00:03:22,574 --> 00:03:24,742
You can let go now.

46
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,649
It's okay.
You--you can let go.

47
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,929
Looks like we made it.
Yeah. We sure did.

48
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,631
<i>sorry about
the unexpected bumps, folks.</i>

49
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:48,467
<i>We just hit
a pocket of rough air.</i>

50
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,503
<i>It should be a smooth ride
from here on out.</i>

51
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:54,206
remind me
to hold it next time, will ya?

52
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,076
I almost died
in that bathroom.

53
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:02,414
Now I know how the laundry feels
when it's in the dryer.

54
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,017
I missed you.

55
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:08,855
I missed you, too,
beautiful.

56
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:56,374
Excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry, mate.
Is this your seat?

57
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,110
The stewardess said
it was empty.
No. No, I'm at the window.

58
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,678
Oh, right.

59
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,619
Listen, mate,
do you mind if I sit here?

60
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,489
It's just the fella next to me
has been snoring

61
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,525
Ever since we took off
from sydney.
yeah, no problem.

62
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,792
Thanks, brother.

63
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:27,904
Something wrong?

64
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:30,006
No. No,
you just...

65
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:32,408
Do I know you
from somewhere?

66
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,512
well, I'm not sure.

67
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,182
Desmond.

68
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,917
Jack.

69
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:43,220
Nice to meet you, jack...

70
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:46,156
Or to see you again.

Aah!

75

00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,168
hey!

81
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:02,438
Hello?

82
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,214
Hello?!

83
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,592
Hey!

84
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:26,527
hey! Hey! Kate!

85
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,163
it's okay. It's me, miles.
It's okay.

86
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,402
What happened?
What?

87
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,071
Where are we?

88
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,607
I can't--I can't here you.
Are your ears ringing?

89
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,181
What is it?

90
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,337
We're back.

91
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:51,058
Back where?

92
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:06,634
No.

93
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:09,132
Is that the construction site?

94
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,366
No.

95
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:13,935
It's the swan hatch...

96
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,936
After desmond blew it up.

97
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:19,572
Guess we're not in 1977, huh?

98
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:32,947
Jack? Jack.

99
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:38,184
Can you hear me? Jack!

100
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,420
What happened?

101
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,825
Where are we?
At the hatch.

102
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:01,235
<i>What? They built it?</i>

103
00:11:01,236 --> 00:11:04,437
Yeah. They built it.

104
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,076
sawyer!

105
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:11,578
Uhh!

106
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,747
<i>You were wrong!</i>

107
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:17,584
That's the damn swan hatch--

108
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:20,219
<i>Blown up
just like we left it</i>

109
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,320
Before we started
jumping through time!

110
00:11:23,321 --> 00:11:26,791
You said we could stop it
from ever gettin' built!

111
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:29,093
That our plane would never
crash on this island!
Stop it!

112
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:31,261
This ain't l.A.X.!
Stop it!

113
00:11:31,262 --> 00:11:33,596
You blew us right back
where we started!

114
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:36,198
Except juliet's dead.

115
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:43,370
She's dead, you son of a bitch,
'cause you were wrong.

116
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:46,874
sawyer...

117
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,842
I'm sorry.

118
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:52,146
I thought we were
supposed to...

119
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,148
I thought it would work.

120
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:57,117
<i>Well, it didn't!</i>

121
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,530
You in line?

122
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,865
No, I'm just waiting
for my friend.

123
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,768
Oh!
Whoa.

124
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,970
I'm sorry. I didn't...
it's okay.

125
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,005
I didn't see you there.
It's okay.

126
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,541
Let's get back to our seats,
sweetheart.

127
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,482
Mmm.

128
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:33,017
Lasagna.

129
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,755
No. No knife and fork
for you, honey.

130
00:12:38,756 --> 00:12:40,757
What do you think
I'm gonna do,

131
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,126
Stab you and run?

132
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,895
Hey, watch we're you're going,
buddy.

133
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,768
Sorry. My bad.

134
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:56,806
say it.
Come on, please? Just once.

135
00:12:56,807 --> 00:12:59,641
I really don't want to,
dude.
I love those commercials.

136
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,642
Come on.
Just do the australian accent,

137
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:03,643
And I'll leave you alone.

138
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:06,411
All right.
Fine. All right.

139
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,980
oi!
Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!

140
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,018
You know who this is?

141
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,921
This is--this is the owner
of mr. Cluck's chicken.

142
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,922
And he's--and he's back here
riding coach

143
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:24,325
With the rest of us yutzes!
Huh? how about th?

144
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,594
Hey, um,
do you mind me asking,

145
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:29,529
How exactly did a guy like you
get to o a major corporation?

146
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,531
I won the lottery
and I like chicken,

147
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,533
So I bought it.

148
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,801
Oh. Good.

149
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,669
Good for you.

150
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,340
You know, you really shouldn't
tell people you won the lottery.

151
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,342
Yeah? Why not?

152
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,645
Cause they'll take advantage
of you. That's why not.

153
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,815
Thanks for the advice, dude,
but it's not gonna happen.

154
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,285
It's not, huh?

155
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:58,520
Nope. Nothing bad
ever happens to me.

156
00:13:58,521 --> 00:14:00,956
I'm the luckiest guy alive.

157
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,434
what just happened?

158
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,036
I found a flashlight.

159
00:14:15,037 --> 00:14:18,272
Dude, who cares? The sky
just went from day to night.

160
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,707
What happened?!
I think we moved through time.

161
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,509
How do you know that?

162
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,844
White flash. Headache.
Can't hear.

163
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:28,314
Happened to me before.
What about jack
and everyone else?

164
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:31,217
Did they move through time,
too?
I don't know.

165
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:33,685
They took one of the other vans
and went up to the worksite.

166
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,687
and then I heard gunfire--

167
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:38,755
<i>Shh!
You said that our plane would
never crash on this island!</i>

168
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:42,391
You hear that, dude?
It's sawyer.
Stay here with sayid.

169
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,695
The bomb must've gone off.

170
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,497
You think an atom bomb went off,
we'd still be standing here?!

171
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,567
I don't know.

172
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:53,970
<i>That's right! You don't!
For once, you don't know!</i>

173
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,339
jack!

174
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,974
Sayid needs help.

175
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:00,441
Where is he?
With hurley at the van.

176
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,476
Two minutes away.
help.

177
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:05,512
He's still bleeding.
We don't know what to do.

178
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:08,481
Help me.

179
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:11,081
So what do you say,
doc?

180
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:13,450
Got another great idea
to save sayid?

181
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:16,352
Maybe there's a nuke
laying around.
Hey, shut up!

182
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:22,558
Help.

183
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:28,229
<i>Juliet!</i>

184
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,530
James?

185
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,564
Oh, my god.

186
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,933
Juliet!

187
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,271
Oh, god.
Oh, god, this is gross.

188
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,809
Don't worry, dude.

189
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,543
Everything's gonna be fine.

190
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:52,879
when I die...

191
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:58,784
What do you think
will happen to me?

192
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,786
Just--just try
not to talk, dude.

193
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:03,823
I've tortured
more people than I can remember.

194
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:07,128
I murdered.

195
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:10,731
Wherever I'm going...

196
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,732
it can't be very pleasant.

197
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,301
Sayid, come on.
I deserve it.

198
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,008
hello?

199
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:28,213
Jin?

200
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,450
Jin!

201
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:39,452
I've got a gun!

202
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,887
And I know how to shoot it!

203
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,911
Hello, hugo.

204
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:14,148
You got a minute?

205
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,431
You're wasting your time,
man.

206
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:56,134
This plane goes down
in the ocean way out here,

207
00:17:56,135 --> 00:17:58,870
I think our chances of survival
are exactly zero.

208
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,973
Actually, in calm seas
w-with a good pilot,

209
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:05,241
We could survive
a water landing.

210
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:07,410
And, uh, the fuel tanks
are buoyant enough

211
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,778
To keep us afloat until
we got in the life rafts.

212
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,147
What?

213
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:14,148
No, it's just impressive
you know that.

214
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,484
What were you doing
in australia?

215
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,853
Business or pleasure?

216
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:22,088
Pleasure. You?

217
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:26,157
I went down to get my sister
out of a bad relationship

218
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:30,126
That it turns out
she didn't want to get out of.

219
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:31,627
So...

220
00:18:31,628 --> 00:18:33,561
Here I am.

221
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:36,765
So what, you were
just down under for vacation?

222
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:39,468
Actually,
I went on a walkabout.

223
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:42,237
Really?

224
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:44,638
Like--like crocodile dundee?

225
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,472
no, not exactly.

226
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,507
But--but, uh,
it was pretty intense.

227
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:51,309
We--we spent ten days
in the outback

228
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,943
And, uh, nothing but our packs
and our knives.

229
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,779
We slept under the stars
and made our own fires,

230
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,514
Hunted our own food.

231
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,049
Wow.

232
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:04,886
I wouldn't make it two days
without my cell phone.

233
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,722
You're not pulling my leg,
are ya?

234
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:11,425
Why would I pull your leg?

235
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:16,929
This thing goes down,
I'm sticking with you.

236
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:51,424
You can stop staring
at the fire.

237
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,096
Jacob's gone.

238
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,331
He's gone.

239
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,767
Why didn't he fight back?

240
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,105
Why did he
let me just kill him?

241
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,540
I guess he knew
that he was beaten.

242
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:13,912
Ben...

243
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,881
I want you to go outside

244
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,818
And tell richard
that I need to talk to him.

245
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:22,720
Talk to him about... What?

246
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,822
That's between me and richard.

247
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:33,329
There's no other reason.
no, that's not how
it's gonna be.

248
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,932
You have to--you're not going
in there.

249
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:39,301
listen to me. I already did.
Now I'm asking you to...

250
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,470
body over by the...

251
00:20:42,738 --> 00:20:44,739
Just back up a little.
Okay?

252
00:20:47,442 --> 00:20:48,907
Who are they?

253
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:50,906
Other than the fact

254
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:53,607
That I know they were
on the ajira flight with us,

255
00:20:53,608 --> 00:20:55,641
All I know is
they knocked me out

256
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:57,442
And dragged my ass
to some cabin,

257
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:00,178
Which they promptly burned,
then...

258
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,780
Brought me here along with
the dead guy in the box.

259
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:06,481
They say
they're the good guys.

260
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:11,285
I'm not buying it either.

261
00:21:13,954 --> 00:21:16,824
Listen to me. Hey! Listen to me,
and listen carefully.

262
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,594
No one goes in there
unless jacob invites them in.

263
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:22,764
Richard, that's why we're here,
because jacob invited us.

264
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:25,532
Asking me what's
in the shadow of the damn statue

265
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,901
Doesn't mean you're in charge.
Then who is?

266
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,969
Richard.

267
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,571
Ben.

268
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:33,873
What happened in there?

269
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:35,575
Everything's fine.

270
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:37,943
John wants to speak to you.

271
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,711
Is jacob all right?
I'm sorry. Who are you?

272
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:43,714
Answer her question, ben.
Well, of course
jacob's all right.

273
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:47,650
They're both together inside.
John just wants to talk to you.

274
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,486
John wants to talk to me?
That's right.

275
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,489
Richard, what are you doing?
I don't understand.

276
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,991
Well, I'm happy
to talk to john.

277
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,960
But before I do, maybe you
should talk to him first.

278
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,110
Hang on, juliet!
We're coming!

279
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:26,581
uhh!

280
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,154
Jin. Flashlight.

281
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:40,124
We can move this beam.
I think I can get down there.

282
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,667
Uhh!

283
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:57,873
Uhh! Too heavy. We need
something to pull it. Jin!

284
00:22:57,907 --> 00:23:00,441
The van! There's chains in it.
Go get 'em!

285
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,519
Where you going, dude?

286
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:14,455
And what are you
doing here?

287
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:16,490
I mean,
I meet you in a taxi,

288
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,558
And you know everything
about me,

289
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,526
And you give me a plane ticket,

290
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,028
Which just so happens
to get me back on this island.

291
00:23:23,063 --> 00:23:26,130
How'd you know
that was gonna happen?

292
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:33,571
Can you hear me? Why aren't you
answering my questions?

293
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:37,407
Look, my friend jin's
gonna be here any second,

294
00:23:37,442 --> 00:23:41,510
So you better stop
ignoring me--
your friend jin
won't be able to see me.

295
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,446
Why not?
Because I died an hour ago.

296
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,113
Sorry, dude. That sucks.

297
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,214
Thanks.

298
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:51,483
How'd you die?

299
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:55,352
I was killed by an old friend
who grew tired of my company.

300
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:02,459
You want me to do something
crazy again, don't you?

301
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:05,028
No. I need you
to save sayid, hugo.

302
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,431
Well, that's why jin
went to go get jack, to--
jin can't help him.

303
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:11,334
You need to take sayid
to the temple.

304
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,371
That's the only chance
he's got.

305
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,040
And the rest of them
will be safe there.

306
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:17,443
The temple? I'm supposed
to know what that is?

307
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,644
Jin knows.

308
00:24:18,678 --> 00:24:21,713
Tell him to take you
to the hole in the wall

309
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,715
Where he was
with the french team.

310
00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:25,416
Through that opening,
you can get into the temple.

311
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:29,120
You still have
that guitar case I gave you?

312
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,154
Yeah.

313
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,622
Bring it.

314
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:36,259
Who are you, dude?

315
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:37,661
I'm jacob.

316
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,268
Hurley!

317
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:47,669
Help me with sayid.

318
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,671
We have to get him into the van.
Juliet needs our help.

319
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,539
Come on! We have to go!

320
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,781
Jin, if I asked you

321
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:06,415
To take me to where
there's like a he in the wall,

322
00:25:06,449 --> 00:25:08,316
Where you went
with the french team,

323
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:11,219
Would you know
what I was talking about?

324
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,020
Yes.

325
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,721
Good.

326
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,731
I'll get the chain.

327
00:25:29,368 --> 00:25:30,602
Juliet?

328
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:32,170
Stop it. Stop, sawyer.

329
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:34,806
The van is here.
The chains are comin'.

330
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:47,348
She ain't makin'
any more noises.
She knows we're here.
She's probably just resting.

331
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:48,683
Juliet!

332
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:57,691
If she dies, I'll kill him.

333
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:07,195
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
nothing to be alarmed about,</i>

334
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,095
<i>But if there is a doctor
on board</i>

335
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,664
Would you please press
your call button?

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,102
Sir, you're a doctor?
Yes.

337
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:20,039
Could you come with me, please?
We appreciate your help.

338
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:22,074
A passenger went
into the restroom

339
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:24,343
About half an hour ago, and he's
not responding when we knock.

340
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:28,912
This man's a doctor.
If he's unconscious in there--
I-I think he tampered
with the lock.

341
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:31,380
It's--it's jammed or something.
I don't know.

342
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,883
Can I be of assistance?
Excuse me.

343
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,862
He's not breathing.

344
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:55,635
What are you doing...?

345
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,866
What's goin' on
back there, earhart?

346
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,636
Yeah, everything's fine, sir.
Please just stay in your seat.
Yeah. Looks peachy.

347
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,471
Sir, I'm gonna need
your help.
What can I do?

348
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:07,806
I need you...

349
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:10,108
Hold this over
his no and mouth.

350
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:13,110
Hold it there, and do not
let any air escape.
Okay. Now?

351
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:15,412
Yes, now.

352
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:20,782
something's blocking
his air passage.

353
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,588
we have to open it up.

354
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,989
I need, uh, something sharp--
a razor.

355
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,559
I got a pen.
A pen?

356
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:37,128
It's regulation.
There's nothing sharp.
A pen! Just a pen.

357
00:27:37,162 --> 00:27:40,264
I had a pen in my jacket
but it's gone.

358
00:27:40,298 --> 00:27:41,565
Damn it.

359
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:45,735
(grunt

360
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,205
I got it. I got it.

361
00:27:57,812 --> 00:28:01,314
Relax. Just relax.
Breathe.

362
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,252
I'm alive?

363
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,955
yeah.
Ah, you're alive.

364
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,725
Terrific.

365
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:32,939
Got it?
Okay, jin!
We're good down here!

366
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,510
hit it!

367
00:28:49,991 --> 00:28:52,259
Give me the flashlight.

368
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:12,608
Juliet.

369
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:20,749
Okay.

370
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:23,018
Juliet. Come here. Okay.

371
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,354
Juliet?

372
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:30,657
Juliet, hey.
I'm here. Come on, baby.

373
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:32,392
Hey, come on, wake up.

374
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:34,660
Wake up.

375
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,663
Hi.

376
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:41,898
Hey.

377
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,800
Okay.

378
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,770
Where... Where...
Where are we?

379
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,372
Don't worry about that.
You're fine.

380
00:29:52,406 --> 00:29:55,574
I gotta get you
out of here, okay?

381
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:02,280
It didn't work.

382
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:04,381
We're still on the island.

383
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:07,217
It's okay. It's okay.

384
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:10,053
I just gotta get this loose
enough to get you out, okay?

385
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:13,855
I need to get you--
no, I hit the bomb.
You're still here.

386
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,023
You what?

387
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:19,226
You hit the bomb?

388
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,494
Why?

389
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:25,530
I wanted you
to be able to go home.

390
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:27,464
I wanted to make it

391
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:29,932
So that you never came
to this damn isld.

392
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:31,936
And it didn't work.

393
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,839
Shh.

394
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,441
Don't you worry about that.

395
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:38,843
You're gonna be okay.

396
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:42,779
I'm gonna get you
outta here,

397
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:45,081
And we're all gonna go home
together. You hear me?

398
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:47,683
Sawyer?

399
00:30:58,226 --> 00:31:01,194
Even if I could get the bullet
out, the bleeding won't stop.

400
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,497
There's nothing
I can do for him.

401
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,766
<i>There's something I can do.</i>

402
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,234
There's a temple.

403
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:11,603
If we can get sayid there,
we can save him.

404
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:15,505
<i>And you know this how?
This guy jacob told me
just before we got here.</i>

405
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,739
Who's jacob?

406
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,908
Does it matter?
Can you fix sayid, jack?

407
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:23,711
No.

408
00:31:23,745 --> 00:31:26,546
Then you're gonna
have to let me do it.

409
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:36,922
Ben, you need to talk to me.

410
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:39,857
I-I can't stop them unless you
tell me what happened in there,

411
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,492
What happened to jacob.

412
00:31:43,894 --> 00:31:46,862
You and I have known each other
for 30 years, ben.

413
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:49,364
I'm asking you this
as a friend.

414
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:52,267
You wanna know what happened,
richard?

415
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,904
Why don't you go inside
and find out?

416
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:04,577
What are you doing?

417
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:07,513
We're goin' in,
and he's comin' with us.

418
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,859
Where's richard?

419
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:25,728
He's not coming.

420
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:28,397
Then who is that behind you?

421
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,840
Where's jacob?

422
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,741
Jacob is dead.

423
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:45,745
Who are you?

424
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,680
Don't worry about me.

425
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:49,648
Let's talk about you.

426
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:53,451
I'm assuming that you are...
What, jacob's bodyguards,

427
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:56,621
And that you came all the way
to this island to protect him?

428
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,722
Well, I have good news.

429
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:02,592
Jacob burned up
right there in that fire.

430
00:33:02,626 --> 00:33:06,595
Therefore there's nothing left
for you to protect. You can go.

431
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,364
You're free.

432
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:15,902
Kill him!

433
00:33:15,937 --> 00:33:17,870
Spread out! Get him!

434
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,208
where is he?!

435
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:55,870
uhh!

436
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,642
Aah!

437
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:03,044
uhh!

438
00:34:09,117 --> 00:34:11,384
Aah!

439
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,301
Aah! Uhh!

440
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:34,640
Aah!

441
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:19,747
I'm sorry you had to see me
like that.

442
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:28,884
sawyer?

443
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,719
Is she okay?

444
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,823
I'm workin' on it!

445
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,530
aah!

446
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:40,104
come on.

447
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,680
Uhh!
Okay.

448
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,648
Okay, I got you.

449
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,483
Está bien, te tengo.
I got you. Okay.

450
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,352
It's okay. I got you.
okay.

451
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:57,321
Don't worry.

452
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:04,228
We should get coffee
some time.

453
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,399
I gotta get you out of here.

454
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:11,067
We can go dutch.

455
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,107
Hey.

456
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,242
Juliet?

457
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:22,510
It's me.

458
00:36:22,544 --> 00:36:25,379
James.

459
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:26,747
yeah.

460
00:36:26,781 --> 00:36:29,482
kiss me.

461
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:34,553
You got it, blondie.

462
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:00,008
I have to tell you
something.

463
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:02,276
It's really, really
important.

464
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:08,915
You tell me.

465
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,684
Tell me.

466
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,320
Julie?

467
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:21,791
ba--you tell m

468
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,462
Oh, god.

469
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,630
I'm here.

470
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,031
I'm--I'm...

471
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:03,523
You did this.

472
00:38:11,797 --> 00:38:14,431
You should've
let that happen, man.

473
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:16,332
I was supposed to die.

474
00:38:19,602 --> 00:38:21,201
Don't take it personally.

475
00:38:21,236 --> 00:38:24,569
Some people just don't know
how to say thanks.

476
00:38:38,073 --> 00:38:39,775
Excuse me, do you know
what happened

477
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:43,111
To the guy that was
sitting next to me?
Oh, we were asleep.

478
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:47,548
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
captain norris here.</i>

479
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,618
<i>We're now beginng
our final descent</i>

480
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:51,619
<i>Into los angeles
international airport.</i>

481
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:54,757
<i>I'm happy to tell you it's
a beautiful day in los angeles.</i>

482
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,694
