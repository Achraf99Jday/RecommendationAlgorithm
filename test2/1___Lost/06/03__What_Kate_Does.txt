<i>في الحلقة السابقة ":</i>

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:05,191
جولييت

3
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:07,820
أنت من فعل هذا

4
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:12,207
كيت? هرلي!

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,731
إحمله . خذه الى الجدول.

6
00:00:17,766 --> 00:00:19,363
- الماء ليست صافية
- ما الذي جرى?

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,705
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

8
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:28,830
- Your friend is dead.
- Jack!

9
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,270
What happened?

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,738
He's alive.

11
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:09,857
It worked?

12
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,461
Dude, you're okay!

13
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:13,966
Hurley, let him breathe.

14
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:16,767
Miles, can you go get some water?

15
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:18,293
Yeah, on it.

16
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,356
Sayid. Hey.

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,117
How are you feeling?

18
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:24,869
A little light-headed.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,324
Jack...

20
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:33,729
What happened to me?

21
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:37,665
You died.

22
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,144
How is that even possible?

23
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,783
I mean...

24
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:47,462
One minute he's gone, and now he's fine?

25
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:49,490
Of course he's fine.

26
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:50,503
What does that mean?

27
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:52,368
He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids.

28
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,339
He's definitely deserves
another go-around.

29
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,238
What are you looking at?

30
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:09,253
How many guys with guns you
think are outside this place?

31
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:09,791
What?

32
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,823
I was out cold when
they brought me in here.

33
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,590
How many guards did you
see? Five? Ten? A hundred?

34
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,041
What are you thinking?

35
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,829
I'm thinking about running, Kate.

36
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,428
She's got hands in handcuffs,

37
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:25,881
but she's probably got 'em covered, okay?

38
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,572
Hey!

39
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,720
<i>Hey, watch it.</i>

40
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,331
Go!

41
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:36,690
- Go now!
- Lady, I already have a customer.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,190
- Damn it, I said go!
- Okay.

43
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,523
Ooh! Easy, easy. Slow down.

44
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:44,623
- Hey, just slow down. Slow down!
- Okay! Okay! You said go!

45
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,491
Just get us out of here.

46
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:49,090
Hey! Hey! Stop the cab!

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,630
Please-- Can you please
just let me out of here?

48
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,720
Be quiet!

49
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,258
What are you doing?

50
00:03:02,293 --> 00:03:03,007
- Move!
- There's a guy.

51
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,162
I'm not gonna run him over.

52
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:07,690
Hey. I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!

53
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,655
<i>Do not get out of this car.</i>

54
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,966
Just go.

55
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,023
Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!

56
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,935
Hey! Hey! What the hell?!

57
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,202
Hey, I got your license plate!

58
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,167
At the light, take a left.

59
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,837
Can you-- Can you please,
please just let me go?

60
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,787
I promise I won't say anything to anyone.

61
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,817
Hey! Hey!

62
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:49,476
Damn it!

63
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,209
Please. Please.

64
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,829
Give me your purse.

65
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:01,356
- What?
- I said, give me your purse!

66
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:04,389
Now get out of the car.

67
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,320
Can I please just... just get my suitcase?

68
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:08,110
No, you can't! Get out of the car!

69
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,158
Easy.

70
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:23,882
<i>Right over there.</i>

71
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:29,683
All right.

72
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:33,896
Who are these people?

73
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,022
What do they want?

74
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,501
It's the Others, dude.

75
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:39,182
They caught us...

76
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:40,908
again.

77
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,590
I don't know. I think
they're trying to protect us.

78
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,390
Yeah, and as... as you can see, uh,

79
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:49,672
Hugo here has assumed
the leadership position,

80
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,157
so... that's pretty great.

81
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:53,297
What?

82
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:54,661
The wound.

83
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,257
It's almost completely closed.

84
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:09,389
Thank you, Jack.

85
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,991
- For what?
- Saving my life.

86
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:30,977
Mr. Jarrah, will you come with us, please?

87
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:32,837
Come with you where?

88
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:35,042
Inside. Nothing to
worry about. We--

89
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,006
I'm coming with him.

90
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,668
Oh, I'm sorry. We need
to talk to him alone.

91
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,471
Just a few questions.

92
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:42,923
You have a few questions? Well, so do we.

93
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,498
I mean, let's start with, who are you?

94
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,433
Why are you holding us here?

95
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:47,866
You...

96
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,093
Once we've spoken to Mr.
Jarrah, we'll be more than happy

97
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,525
to tell you everything you want to know.

98
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,602
Now something tells me

99
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,121
that you're not gonna be
happy to tell us anything.

100
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,909
Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!

101
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:26,337
Please, you don't have to do this.

102
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:29,857
- We won't hurt your friend.
- He ain't my friend.

103
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,001
You do what you want
with him and anybody else.

104
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:35,556
But me? I'm walking outta here.

105
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:36,951
James?

106
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:38,703
<i>I'm gone. You understand?</i>

107
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:41,343
Please.

108
00:06:43,256 --> 00:06:44,614
You have to stay.

109
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:46,990
No, I don't.

110
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,752
Don't come after me.

111
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,837
"What Kate Does"

112
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,944
Hey! Hey!

113
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,590
Where are they taking Sayid?

114
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:28,036
Hey, calm down! Everybody calm down!

115
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,217
- Where'd Ford go?
- What?

116
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,195
<i>Ford.</i>

117
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,760
Your friend who just ran out here...

118
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:35,517
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

119
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:36,952
You really expect me to believe that?

120
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,377
He told me he wanted to
kill me. You believe that?

121
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,188
- I can bring him back.
- You know where he went?

122
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:43,941
No, but I can track him.

123
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:46,273
Let me go.

124
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:49,234
I will bring him back,
and I can make him stay.

125
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:53,122
You sure you wanna go out
there alone with these people?

126
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,024
I'll go with her.

127
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,109
It's very important that
he gets back here safely.

128
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:03,480
What makes you think
he's gonna listen to you?

129
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:06,324
<i>I can be very convincing when I wanna be.</i>

130
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:22,497
Where's your tire hammer?

131
00:08:27,778 --> 00:08:29,348
You got a problem.

132
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,544
So do you. Where's your tire hammer?

133
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,726
Tire hammer'll just cut off your wrists.

134
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,515
Your problem is you need a punch press,

135
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,050
and you're not gonna be
able to use one of those

136
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:39,621
and keep that gun pointed at me.

137
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,985
- You volunteering?
- I got steady hands,

138
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,147
but I kinda feel like we
got off on the wrong foot.

139
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:49,744
I'll give you $200.

140
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:55,776
Now hold still.

141
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:07,299
Thanks.

142
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,587
So why the bracelets?

143
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,195
I'm wanted for murder.

144
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:14,662
Murder?

145
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:16,682
You don't happen to have
somewhere I could change, do you?

146
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,534
Bathroom's over there.

147
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:21,905
Make it quick.

148
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:23,015
Thank you.

149
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,929
You better not slow us down.

150
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:28,092
<i>You better not slow me down.</i>

151
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,540
I'd go with you, but...

152
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,415
Sawyer would kill you?

153
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:46,939
I'll take care of James.
You take care of Sayid.

154
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:49,953
Deal.

155
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:57,852
Good-bye.

156
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,175
Be careful.

157
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,646
What is it you want?

158
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:33,226
Please, whatever you're
thinking of doing...

159
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,098
What is that?

160
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:01,546
Just tell me what you want.

161
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,345
Why?!

162
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,542
Why are you doing this?

163
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:50,981
I don't have any secrets.

164
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:53,388
Ask...

165
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm sorry we had to put you through that.

166
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:20,167
<i>- It was a test. We had to be sure.
- Test to be sure of what?</i>

167
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:21,755
Don't worry.

168
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,264
You passed.

169
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,159
I just lied to him, didn't I?

170
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,631
Yes.

171
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,420
Where were you going?

172
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:01,770
What?

173
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,650
Before I got in the cab,
where were you going?

174
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:06,542
Why, so you can hijack them, too?

175
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,795
I was waiting for a bus.

176
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:12,067
I came to bring you your stuff.

177
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:16,313
Relax. I didn't take your money.

178
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,852
Well, uh, gee, thanks.

179
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:23,046
- So where were you goin'?
- Don't worry about it.

180
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:27,624
Fine.

181
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,021
Langdon Street.

182
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:34,387
Brentwood.

183
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,686
You got family there?

184
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,779
Uh, no.

185
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,206
It's the... couple who's adopting my baby.

186
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:47,342
They were, um, they were meant
to meet me at the airport,

187
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:50,030
but I guess they got the
days mixed up or somethin'.

188
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:53,412
- It's not like they abandoned me.
- Brentwood's not far. Get in.

189
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:54,896
Seriously?

190
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:57,876
Do you want a ride or not?

191
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:12,147
So why do you people want
us to stay at the temple?

192
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:13,418
We're protecting you.

193
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:14,369
From what?

194
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,114
You've been on this
island for a while, right?

195
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,091
Ever see a big pillar
of black smoke--

196
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,682
Makes a "ticka ticka"
sound, looks pissed off?

197
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:21,650
Yes.

198
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:23,205
<i>From that.</i>

199
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,627
Do you know anything about
another plane coming in?

200
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:27,845
An Ajira flight.

201
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:29,651
I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?

202
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,500
I think he means
the one that landed--

203
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:34,652
<i>Justin. Shut up.</i>

204
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,878
No, no, no, that's a decoy trail.

205
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:43,660
He went this way.

206
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,115
- And you're basing this on what?
- Experience.

207
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:49,008
- Aldo.
- What?

208
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:50,760
I think she's right.

209
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:53,571
Of course she is.

210
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,235
After you, Princess.

211
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,575
So what's your strategy for
bringing your boyfriend back?

212
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,263
I hope you got one, because
he shot a guy on his way out.

213
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,488
If he tries that on me,

214
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,307
- I'm gonna blow his head off.
- Watch it!

215
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,419
Thank you.

216
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:11,202
Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.

217
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,625
The Frenchwoman? No,
she's been dead for years.

218
00:16:13,695 --> 00:16:15,544
- This... this couldn't
be one of her-- - Justin!

219
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:17,724
Shut up.

220
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,659
What was he gonna say?

221
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,078
You don't even remember me, do you?

222
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:28,791
You don't recognize me?

223
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,280
Well, maybe this will jog your memory.

224
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,284
Three years ago,

225
00:16:33,507 --> 00:16:36,768
you staged yourself a little
prison break, and you did it

226
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,805
by knocking the guard out
with the butt of your rifle.

227
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,321
<i>That would be me.</i>

228
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,340
What are you doing?

229
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,178
Escaping.

230
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,906
Sayid!

231
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,282
You okay, man?

232
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,188
Jack! He's back!

233
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,070
Sayid, what happened?

234
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,171
- They tortured me.
- Why?

235
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,037
Don't know.

236
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:25,064
They didn't ask me any questions.

237
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,878
Step aside.

238
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,644
Hey, Shephard.

239
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:56,667
We were hoping you'd come on your own.

240
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,353
What the hell did you do to Sayid?

241
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:03,338
We--We didn't do anything to
him. Y--Your friend is sick.

242
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:04,857
Sick with what?

243
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,501
He's...

244
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:11,607
Yeah, I... not really...

245
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:13,372
There's not really a literal translation.

246
00:18:13,407 --> 00:18:14,576
The closest thing would be...

247
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:16,935
Infected.

248
00:18:16,936 --> 00:18:19,525
Infected? He's not even runnin' a fever.

249
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,122
What...

250
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,019
Did I say something funny?

251
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:28,215
I doubt it. He doesn't
really have a sense of humor.

252
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,657
He says you have to give
your friend this pill.

253
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,631
Are you serious?

254
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,384
<i>Why don't you give it to him?</i>

255
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:54,503
Because it won't work
unless he takes it willingly,

256
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,932
and he won't take it willingly from us.

257
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:58,342
Well, then maybe you
should've asked him to take it

258
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:00,640
- before you tortured him.
- We didn't torture him.

259
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,686
- We were diagnosing him.
- To see if he was infected.

260
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,245
Yes.

261
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:09,707
I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid

262
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:10,800
unless I know what's in it.

263
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,475
Tell me, Shephard...

264
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:18,451
Your friend...

265
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:21,856
How did he get shot?

266
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:24,939
He was, um...

267
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,936
He was helping me.

268
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,777
<i>So it was your fault?</i>

269
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,331
Yes.

270
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,770
And there have been others
who were hurt or died...

271
00:19:39,224 --> 00:19:40,248
helping you?

272
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:43,238
Yes.

273
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,332
Well...

274
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:52,349
Then this is your chance
to redeem yourself.

275
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:01,558
It's medicine,

276
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,981
and your friend needs it.

277
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,454
What happens if I don't give it to him?

278
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,564
The infection will spread.

279
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,651
So... nothing? There wasn't anything?

280
00:20:25,886 --> 00:20:29,215
No white light? Angels singing?

281
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,334
No dead relatives?

282
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:32,152
I remember being shot.

283
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:35,082
You're not a zombie, right?

284
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,113
No. I am not a zombie.

285
00:20:42,726 --> 00:20:43,136
Hey.

286
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,045
You mind giving me and Sayid a minute?

287
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,495
Yeah, see, private
talks kinda freak me out

288
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,761
'cause they usually lead to me

289
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:55,897
having to do something
I don't quite understand.

290
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,630
I'm right there with ya.

291
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,617
It's fine. We'll be in the
food court if you need us.

292
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:15,928
So did they tell you why they
burnt me with a hot poker?

293
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,379
They said they were
trying to diagnose you.

294
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,723
Right.

295
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,165
They told me it was some sort of test,

296
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,944
which they said I passed.

297
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:31,427
Clearly, I didn't.

298
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,504
What's that?

299
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,247
They want you to take it.

300
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:45,824
It's medicine, according to them.

301
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:47,711
<i>What about according to you?</i>

302
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,684
I don't know.

303
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,001
And you know, before when you...

304
00:21:55,727 --> 00:21:58,062
when you thanked me for
saving your life, I...

305
00:22:00,594 --> 00:22:02,841
I didn't have anything
to do with it, Sayid.

306
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,994
I didn't fix you. They did.

307
00:22:11,693 --> 00:22:13,448
I don't care who fixed me.

308
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,913
I only care about who I trust,

309
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,310
so if you want me to take that pill, Jack,

310
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:22,300
I'll do it.

311
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:35,858
Wait. Where are you going?

312
00:22:35,893 --> 00:22:36,794
Catching up with Sawyer.

313
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:39,561
So you never planned to
bring him back to the temple.

314
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:42,309
No. I'm not interested in
being a prisoner. Are you?

315
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:44,601
- Where did your plane land, Kate?
- What?

316
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,427
The Ajira plane that you,
Jack and Hurley came in on...

317
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,063
- Where did it land?
- I don't know.

318
00:22:50,098 --> 00:22:53,761
Sun was on that plane,
too, and I have to find her.

319
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:55,098
You think they're gonna tell you?

320
00:22:55,358 --> 00:22:58,698
You think they care about you
or about Sun or about any of us?

321
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,291
<i>Who do you care about, Kate?</i>

322
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:06,399
Good luck, Jin.

323
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,761
Once you catch up with
Sawyer... then what?

324
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,155
I guess we'll figure that out together.

325
00:23:20,926 --> 00:23:22,160
So...

326
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,490
What happened to your handcuffs?

327
00:23:24,992 --> 00:23:26,270
I cut them off.

328
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,012
It's a beautiful neighborhood.

329
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,866
I bet they're a really nice couple.

330
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:43,938
What?

331
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,626
I didn't say anything.

332
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:49,820
What, you... you think they didn't
come to the airport on purpose?

333
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:52,590
Why would I think that?

334
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,272
Good, 'cause they didn't.

335
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:01,192
This is it.

336
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,514
Um...

337
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,104
Will you come in with me?

338
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,246
Are you kidding me?

339
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:21,898
Please, I... I just...

340
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,128
I really don't want to
go up there on my own.

341
00:24:35,494 --> 00:24:37,451
Uh, hi. Uh, Mrs. Baskum?

342
00:24:37,494 --> 00:24:39,227
I... I'm... I'm Claire Littleton.

343
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,961
Oh, my, uh...

344
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,513
I'm so sorry. Um...

345
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:50,437
My husband...

346
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,383
He left me.

347
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:01,077
And... believe me,

348
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:03,609
I wanted the baby so much,

349
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,842
but...

350
00:25:05,694 --> 00:25:07,449
I can't do it alone.

351
00:25:08,293 --> 00:25:09,672
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:13,545
Look, I know I should've called you...

353
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:14,861
So,
uh, wh--

354
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,692
Y--You just
changed your mind?

355
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,230
Look, my... my life is just...

356
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:21,866
a little bit complicated

357
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,845
- right now.
- She came all the way from Australia,

358
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:25,425
- and you don't call?
- Oh, my God.

359
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:30,336
Are you okay?

360
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:32,241
Aah! It's coming!

361
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,146
Who's there?

362
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,711
Better come out now

363
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:24,839
or so help me, I'm just
gonna start shootin'.

364
00:27:29,861 --> 00:27:31,682
What the hell are you doin' here?

365
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,936
I was worried about you.

366
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:07,566
What's happening?

367
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:11,351
- I--I think I'm having
contractions. - When did they start?

368
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,049
- Um, about 20 minutes ago.
- Try to relax.

369
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:16,119
We're gonna take you to
the MCU to get looked at.

370
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:17,568
Are you with her?

371
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,134
- Yeah.
- Okay, follow me.

372
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,817
What are you doing?
What... what's going on?

373
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:25,803
Hold on. The doctor will be
with you in just a moment.

374
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:28,228
What... what's going on?

375
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,406
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

376
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:32,152
Excuse me.

377
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,667
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

378
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:37,137
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.

379
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:38,635
Can I please get your help in here?

380
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:43,686
Ms. Littleton?

381
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:45,861
Claire, how are you feeling?

382
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:49,244
Uncomfortable, what...
W--What's happening?

383
00:28:49,582 --> 00:28:50,535
What's happening...

384
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,939
is that Mother Nature's gotten
a little ahead of herself.

385
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:56,308
Are you ready to have your baby?

386
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:59,831
- I... I'm sorry. What?!
- You're at 36 weeks.

387
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,700
Three centimeters dilated
and about 80% effaced.

388
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,055
Which means, if you want, you
can have your baby tonight.

389
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,749
If I want? So what, you mean...
you mean, you can stop it then?

390
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:12,126
Maybe. However, to do that
would require a number of drugs.

391
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:14,137
Drugs? I mean, w--
Will that hurt the baby?

392
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,341
No, they're perfectly safe.

393
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:16,658
I just don't want to have to

394
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:18,234
stick you with needles if I don't have to.

395
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:19,954
So it's up to you.

396
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:31,868
I'm... I'm not ready.

397
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:32,509
Okay.

398
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:35,255
Let's get her started
on the nifedipine drip.

399
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:39,082
Wh--What...
What is it?

400
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,340
Margaret, let's do an ultrasound.

401
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:43,141
I wanna get a picture of
what's going on in there.

402
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,083
Ah, it... it could just mean
the baby's out of position.

403
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,887
W--What are you...
What are you saying?!

404
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,186
W--What's happening
to my baby?!

405
00:29:50,282 --> 00:29:52,054
Is my baby okay?!

406
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,282
Is Aaron okay?!

407
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:57,132
See?

408
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:01,850
There he is. Everything is just fine.

409
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:03,955
Your boy just likes to move around.

410
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,111
140 BPM.

411
00:30:08,282 --> 00:30:10,016
Perfectly normal.

412
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:11,860
I have a feeling

413
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:15,743
that Aaron is gonna be a handful.

414
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,058
Now let's see if we can slow this down.

415
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,888
You did great, Mommy.

416
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:25,675
Thanks.

417
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:55,401
A couple days ago,

418
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,999
you asked me why I
came back to the island.

419
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:05,681
I need to find Claire.

420
00:31:06,674 --> 00:31:07,883
I thought...

421
00:31:08,782 --> 00:31:12,179
maybe if I could catch up
to you, you could help me,

422
00:31:12,582 --> 00:31:14,014
and then...

423
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,782
Maybe if we could find her
and bring her back to Aaron,

424
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,964
then maybe all of this
wouldn't have been for nothing.

425
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:25,640
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:28,812
I never should've followed you.

427
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:31,633
Which time?

428
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:42,311
That was your house, right? With Juliet.

429
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:44,829
Yep.

430
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:48,552
I'm sorry.

431
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:50,901
- You already said that.
- No...

432
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,382
For Juliet.

433
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,560
If I hadn't come after you on the sub,

434
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,985
then you two would've left,
and she would've never died.

435
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,694
It's not your fault she's dead.

436
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:09,354
It's mine.

437
00:32:11,482 --> 00:32:13,488
She was sittin' right there,

438
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:15,936
right where you are now,

439
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:18,826
tryin' to leave this place.

440
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,285
And I convinced her to stay.

441
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,511
I made her stay on this island

442
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:31,510
'cause I didn't want to be alone.

443
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:37,362
You understand that, right?

444
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:46,022
But, uh...

445
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,067
But I think some of us...

446
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,926
are meant to be alone.

447
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,158
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

448
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:19,190
Ahh.

449
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,086
You can probably make it back
to the temple by nightfall.

450
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,351
What's that?

451
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:09,632
It's a baseball.

452
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:21,440
You speak pretty good English

453
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,161
for someone that needs a translator.

454
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:27,015
We both know that I
don't need a translator.

455
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,109
Then why do you have one?

456
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:33,215
Because I have to remain separate

457
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,450
from the people I'm in charge of.

458
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,502
It makes it easier

459
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:41,549
when they don't like the
decisions I make for them.

460
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,699
Who are you?

461
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,924
My name is Dogen.

462
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,253
Are you from here... the island?

463
00:34:52,368 --> 00:34:54,582
I was brought here like everyone else.

464
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:56,983
What do you mean, "brought here"?

465
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,947
You know exactly what I mean.

466
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,223
You didn't give your
friend the pill, did you?

467
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:11,269
No.

468
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:13,975
Why not?

469
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,534
Because I don't know what's in it.

470
00:35:18,515 --> 00:35:20,960
- It will eliminate--
- The infection, yeah.

471
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:22,257
I got that.

472
00:35:23,115 --> 00:35:25,896
- But what's in it?
- I cannot explain.

473
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:27,594
- Try.
- There isn't any time.

474
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:30,475
<i>- He'll die if you don't...
- He already died.</i>

475
00:35:33,415 --> 00:35:35,282
What is in it?

476
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,077
You just have to trust me.

477
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:45,553
I don't trust myself.

478
00:35:46,549 --> 00:35:48,121
How am I supposed to trust you?

479
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:57,346
Let's see where trust gets us.

480
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:14,135
Now... are you gonna tell me

481
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:15,940
what's in it?

482
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,007
Poison.

483
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,416
Come in.

484
00:36:36,936 --> 00:36:39,180
Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?

485
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,755
Um, yeah?

486
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,322
I'm Detective Rasmussen.

487
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,634
- Is Ms. Hart here?
- Uh, I'm sorry. Who?

488
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:48,758
Joan Hart. She signed in with you.

489
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:52,079
Oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver.

490
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:53,976
I needed help, and she brought me up here.

491
00:36:54,036 --> 00:36:56,044
She left after they treated me, though.

492
00:36:56,702 --> 00:36:57,809
Did she, uh,

493
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,063
give you any indication
where she was headed?

494
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:01,223
Why? Is something wrong?

495
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,927
No. It's nothing for you to worry about.

496
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,135
Come on. Let's go.

497
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:17,836
<i>E.K.G. tech to 3-1-5.
E.K.G. tech to 3-1-5.</i>

498
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:19,594
Thanks.

499
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:20,871
Sure.

500
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:26,053
<i>Thank you.</i>

501
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,173
Why... Why are they after you?

502
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,658
What... What did you do?

503
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,974
Would you believe me if
I said I was innocent?

504
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:41,436
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

505
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,353
Well, I should go.

506
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:52,330
Oh, wait. Um...

507
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:54,948
Here. Take my credit card.

508
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,846
No.

509
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:57,394
There's not much of a limit on it,

510
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:58,827
but it's something.

511
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,649
You don't have to do this.

512
00:38:00,684 --> 00:38:02,602
You didn't have to do what you did either.

513
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:12,669
Aaron's a great name.

514
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,048
I don't know why I said it. It's like...

515
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:17,505
I don't know. I knew it or something.

516
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,400
I think you should keep him.

517
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,336
Well, um, good luck.

518
00:38:27,836 --> 00:38:28,327
Yeah.

519
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:30,443
You, too.

520
00:38:31,137 --> 00:38:32,519
Thanks.

521
00:39:24,524 --> 00:39:25,869
He swallowed it?

522
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:29,545
Yes.

523
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:38,757
What's this?

524
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,126
Tea.

525
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:58,968
Why would you people want to kill Sayid?

526
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,261
We believe he has been...

527
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:15,147
Closest translation is "claimed."

528
00:40:15,688 --> 00:40:16,756
Claimed.

529
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,602
By what?

530
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:26,738
There is a darkness growing in him.

531
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,789
And once it reaches his heart,

532
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,485
everything your friend once was...

533
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:36,373
will be gone.

534
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,224
No, I...

535
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:42,432
How can you be sure of that?

536
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,699
Because it happened to your sister.

537
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,353
Get up!

538
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:20,236
That's for my head.

539
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:22,429
Now...

540
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:24,564
- Where's that bitch?
- I don't know.

541
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:28,649
You don't understand. I'm
going back to the temple!

542
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:29,194
Yeah, right.

543
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:32,044
It looks like he's alone.
Maybe we should take him back.

544
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,556
Or maybe we didn't find him alive.

545
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:36,980
<i>Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.</i>

546
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:38,120
<i>He may be one of them.</i>

547
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:39,601
Hey! Hey!

548
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:48,766
Where you goin'?

549
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,082
Claire?

550
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:09,870
