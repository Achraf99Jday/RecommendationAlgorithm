1
00:00:05,249 --> 00:00:06,834
Son of a bitch.

2
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,346
We're gonna get you to
the hospital. Mr. Locke?

3
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:31,832
Mr. Locke?

4
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:33,885
You found what they were
hiding in the submarine.

5
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,771
I most certainly did.

6
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:44,931
Aah!

7
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,269
Hello, Hugo.
We have to talk to you.

8
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,896
"We"?

9
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,037
Okay, guys.

10
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:51,475
Come on out.

11
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:06,984
Hello, Jack.

12
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,863
I was hoping you'd come.

13
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,112
I think we have some
catching up to do.

14
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,265
Hurley...

15
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:31,483
This was your idea.

16
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,920
You all right with me
talking with him alone?

17
00:01:37,317 --> 00:01:38,959
It's all you, dude.

18
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,181
All right, let's catch up.

19
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,659
You look just like him.

20
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:03,622
Does it bother you?

21
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:06,583
No, what bothers me is I don't have
any idea what the hell you are.

22
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,562
Sure you do.

23
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,728
Why John Locke?

24
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:21,559
Because he was stupid enough to believe
that he'd been brought here for a reason,

25
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,610
Because...

26
00:02:23,013 --> 00:02:25,465
He pursued that belief
until it got him killed,

27
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:27,257
And because you were kind enough

28
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,879
To bring his body back
here in a nice wooden box.

29
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,006
He had to be dead before
you could look like him.

30
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:34,760
That's right.

31
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,231
Who else have you looked like?

32
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,211
Jack, what do you
really want to ask me?

33
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:48,085
The third day we were here,
I saw...

34
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,799
I chased my father
through the jungle...My...

35
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,310
My dead father.

36
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,446
Was that you?

37
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,377
Yes, that was me.

38
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,543
Why?

39
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,049
You needed to find water.

40
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:13,835
This may be hard for
you to believe, Jack,

41
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:17,097
But all I've ever been
interested in is helping you.

42
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:19,316
Help me?

43
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:21,587
To do what?

44
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,611
Leave.

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,822
<i>But because Jacob chose you,</i>

46
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:29,004
You were trapped on this island
before you even got here.

47
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,343
But now Jacob's dead.

48
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,443
We don't have to
be trapped anymore.

49
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:39,246
We can get on an airplane and
fly away anytime we want to.

50
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:44,105
And if we can just fly away whenever
we want, why are you still here?

51
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:48,027
<i>Because it has to be all of us.</i>

52
00:03:53,773 --> 00:03:55,010
What?

53
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,599
John Locke was the only one of us
that ever believed in this place.

54
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:02,844
He did everything he could to keep us
from leaving this island.

55
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,129
John Locke was not
a believer, Jack.

56
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,151
He was a sucker.

57
00:04:13,131 --> 00:04:15,523
Sinus tach at 130, b.p. dropping.

58
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,454
Last read was 62 over 30,

59
00:04:17,485 --> 00:04:19,077
Possibly due to internal bleeding.

60
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:21,149
Any signs of neurological damage?

61
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,726
No response in lower reflexes.

62
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,263
- That's because he's a paraplegic.
- You know this man?

63
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,973
Yes. He's a substitute teacher
at my school. His name is...

64
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,441
Locke. Mr. Locke.
I don't know his first name.

65
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,231
But he uses a wheelchair.
Where is it?

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,365
Smashed to pieces,
that thing probably saved his life.

67
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,760
I saw the man that did this,
the--the hit-and-run driver.

68
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,929
He--he was at our school. When we get to
the hospital, you can talk to the cops.

69
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,752
But do you know anyone
we can contact for him?

70
00:04:41,872 --> 00:04:43,878
I have no idea. Like I said, I barely
know him

71
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:46,281
- Helen.
- What did you say?

72
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:49,155
Helen Norwood.

73
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,518
I was... Gonna marry her.

74
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,071
Well...

75
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:58,165
You're still gonna marry her 'cause
you're gonna be okay, Mr. Locke.

76
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,042
John.

77
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:03,033
My name is John.

78
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,629
Blunt force trauma victim,
late 40s male,

79
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:08,816
- He needs a C.T. scan.
- We got a gunshot wound here. Female.

80
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,904
- Entry wound-- upper right quadrant.
- Baby! Baby!

81
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:13,353
Yes, sir. I understand. She's pregnant.
We're gonna take good care of her.

82
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:14,428
Baby!

83
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,061
500 lost cc's.
External blood loss. baby!

84
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,107
We're gonna do everything we can.

85
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,027
What is it?

86
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,729
You can come out.

87
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,908
You following us, Claire?

88
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,120
Yeah.

89
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:57,501
Why?

90
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,243
'cause he's my brother.

91
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,924
Looks like you two have a
lot of catching up to do.

92
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:09,250
I'll leave you to it.

93
00:06:16,429 --> 00:06:19,097
- Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry th--
- Did he tell you?

94
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,956
That he was the one
pretending to be our father?

95
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,887
Yeah.

96
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:27,149
Yeah, he told me.

97
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,515
You know, I pretty much gave up hoping
that you'd ever come back.

98
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,521
Now that you're here...

99
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,820
It's--it's good to see you, Jack.

100
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,010
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

101
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:48,638
You know, I-I never really had
much in the way of family, so it...

102
00:06:49,307 --> 00:06:51,361
So it... Really means a lot
that you're coming with us.

103
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:59,134
Actually, I haven't--I haven't
decided if I'm coming with you.

104
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:02,583
Yeah, you have.

105
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,174
What do you mean?

106
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,380
You decided the moment
you let him talk to you,

107
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,882
Just like the rest of us.

108
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:14,136
So, you know, whether you like it or not,

109
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:16,834
You're with him now.

110
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:32,340
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

111
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:38,551
He's got a submarine?

112
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,426
Keep your voice down, damn it.

113
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,241
Yeah, Widmore's got a sub.

114
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,122
We're using it to get off this rock.

115
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,728
Are we gonna tell Sun?

116
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,032
Kate's telling her now.

117
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:52,367
I thought we might
want to avoid huddles.

118
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,212
What about Sayid?

119
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,087
Sayid ain't invited.
He's gone over to the dark side.

120
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,835
Yeah, but you can always bring
people back from the dark side.

121
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:03,520
- I mean, anakin-
- Who the hell's Anakin?

122
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,883
Look, just keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to no one.

123
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,253
Hey.

124
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,323
Hey, Claire.

125
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,285
Hey, Hurley.

126
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,819
You look great.

127
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:33,414
It's so nice to have
everyone back together again.

128
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,392
Want an apple?

129
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,785
Hey, Schaub, I'm the
one who brought her in.

130
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,183
Wanna give us a minute?

131
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,243
Katherine Anne Austen.

132
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,999
Wanted for arson,
assault on a federal officer,

133
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:11,497
Murder in the first degree.

134
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,716
Funny. You don't strike
me as the murdering kind.

135
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,494
That's because I'm not.

136
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:24,180
You be sure and mention that
to feds when they get here.

137
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,032
There something you wanted?

138
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,976
You remember me? From the airport?

139
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:34,489
We were on the same
flight from Sydney.

140
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,144
Yeah, I remember.

141
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,969
Well, don't you think it's weird--

142
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,149
You and me being on the same flight,
having that little meet-up in the elevator?

143
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:47,226
And a week later--boom.

144
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:50,037
Of all the cars in Los Angeles,
you smash into mine.

145
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:54,044
Almost like someone's
trying to put us together.

146
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:56,506
Are you hitting on me?

147
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,226
It'd never work, sweetheart.

148
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:01,807
- I'm a cop. You're a murderer-
- I already told you. I'm not a murderer.

149
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,810
Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.

150
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,146
So why didn't you arrest me?

151
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:11,538
- I did arrest you.
- No, in L.A.X.,

152
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,626
The elevator.

153
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:15,531
You saw I was wearing handcuffs.

154
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,130
I didn't see any handcuffs.

155
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,955
All I saw was a pretty lady who needed
the door held open for her.

156
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:25,185
You know what I think?

157
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,187
I think you let me go because
you went to Australia,

158
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,117
And you didn't want anyone
to know you were there.

159
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,551
<i>Should I tell that to the feds
when they get here?</i>

160
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:46,007
<i>Oh, I like you.</i>

161
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:48,903
Jim. Got a live one. Come on.

162
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,080
Sorry.

163
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,858
Duty calls.

164
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:57,458
We caught a multiple
homicide at a restaurant.

165
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,880
Victims were a lowlife named Keamy
and three goons on his payroll.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,367
Korean female G.S.W. at the scene,

167
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,502
And her boyfriend witnessed it,
but he doesn't speak English.

168
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,340
Any suspects?

169
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:09,455
Yeah, an A.T.M. surveillance camera

170
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,632
Grabbed this jaboney
fleeing the scene.

171
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,161
All righty.
Put a name to that face.

172
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,444
That's our bad guy.

173
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,272
He's different now.

174
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,365
<i>Guess we're all different now.</i>

175
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:46,053
So what did Locke say to you?

176
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,782
He said that he wants to leave,

177
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:50,588
And we all have to go together.

178
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,338
- And do you believe him?
- I'm not sure yet.

179
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,137
Hands up.

180
00:11:58,257 --> 00:11:59,806
Stop right there.

181
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:01,459
Where's the man in charge?

182
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:02,924
Who's she?

183
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:04,682
That's Widmore's number two.

184
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,789
What can I do for ya?

185
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:18,921
You took something from us,
and we want it back.

186
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,441
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,513
It's okay.

188
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,412
- Do you have a fix on my position?
- Roger that.

189
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,808
Show them what we're capable of.

190
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:52,330
You have until nightfall
to return what you took.

191
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,418
Or next time, we won't miss.

192
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:02,480
Call me when you're ready
for us to pick him up.

193
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,206
Well...

194
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,750
Here we go.

195
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:41,792
Uh, hi. I have an appointment with
the Western Pacific adoption agency.

196
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,047
15th floor. And sign in, please.

197
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,215
Sure.

198
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,362
Hey there.

199
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:50,888
How are you?

200
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,623
Uh, we met at the airport-- the,
uh, the baggage claim.

201
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,225
Oh, yeah. Hi.

202
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:57,629
Hi. I'm Desmond. Desmond hume.

203
00:13:57,749 --> 00:13:59,899
Um, I never got your name. Uh...

204
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,630
"Claire Littleton."

205
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,459
so--so how you doin'?

206
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:06,750
Um, I'm okay. Better now.
I actually had a bit of a scare.

207
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,732
- Ended up in the hospital.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry. Are you...

208
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:11,351
Oh, no. It's all good now, so...

209
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:14,927
Oh, by the way, uh,
you were right.

210
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,801
It's a boy.

211
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,525
I have a nose for these things.

212
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:21,916
Look, um...

213
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,250
Excuse me if this sounds
a bit personal, but, um,

214
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:29,230
I couldn't help noticing you're going
to an adoption agency... Alone.

215
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,781
Uh... Yeah. You're right.
It is personal.

216
00:14:32,816 --> 00:14:35,716
No, I just meant you should have some-
-some legal representation.

217
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:37,384
What, are you a lawyer?

218
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,885
No. No.

219
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,809
But, uh, it just so happens
that I'm on my way to see one.

220
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,699
You know, adoption
contracts are complicated.

221
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,426
And you should be careful because

222
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,622
You could find yourself in a situation
that's...

223
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,896
Irreversible.

224
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,858
Yeah, I-I don't have
money for a lawyer.

225
00:15:00,873 --> 00:15:01,969
What floor?

226
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:04,772
Um... I'm... I'm going to 15 as well.

227
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,882
Look, this, um, this attorney
I'm seeing--she's excellent.

228
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:12,678
Uh, you know, plus,
she owes me a favor.

229
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,447
So...

230
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,915
Why don't you just
come and meet her?

231
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,029
You know, I think she
could really help you.

232
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,153
Look, I promise you,

233
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,774
It won't cost you a cent.

234
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,354
Please.

235
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,577
It'd be my absolute pleasure.

236
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,495
Uh, sure.

237
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,188
Great. This way.

238
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,014
Thanks.

239
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:46,425
Hi. Uh, Desmond hume to see
Ms. Verdansky, please.

240
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,478
Oh, yes. Mr. Hume.
She's expecting you.

241
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:51,837
Have a seat. Great.

242
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,480
Hey, um... Thank you.

243
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,635
You're very welcome.

244
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,413
Desmond!

245
00:15:58,893 --> 00:16:00,407
Ah, Ilana.

246
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,112
Uh, Claire, this is Ilana.

247
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:05,710
Ilana, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Claire Littleton. Um...

248
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,321
I was hoping you'd
be able to help her.

249
00:16:12,698 --> 00:16:13,996
I'm sorry.

250
00:16:14,116 --> 00:16:16,199
Claire Littleton from Australia?

251
00:16:16,234 --> 00:16:18,601
Um, do I know you?

252
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:21,871
No, but this is
quite a coincidence.

253
00:16:21,905 --> 00:16:24,539
We've been looking for you.

254
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,378
Desmond, do you mind if I speak
with Ms. Littleton alone for a few minutes?

255
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,413
No. Absolutely fine.
Go right ahead.

256
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,224
Listen up, everyone.

257
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:46,869
Hey.

258
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,683
What's going on?

259
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,062
People are trying
to kill us again.

260
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,176
All this is happening a bit
sooner than I'd expected,

261
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:56,728
But these people
have forced our hand,

262
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,476
Claiming we stole
something from them,

263
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,964
Trying to provoke us
into a confrontation.

264
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,820
Well, if that's what they want,
that's what they'll get.

265
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,788
Gather your things.

266
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,221
We're going to the other island
and we're getting on that plane.

267
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:11,528
James, I need your
help with something.

268
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,945
There's a boat moored

269
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,897
Just a few hours down
the shore from here.

270
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:20,364
I want you to get it and meet the rest
of us on the other side of these bluffs.

271
00:17:20,724 --> 00:17:22,803
We'll all sail over to the
other island together.

272
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:23,937
Can you do that, James?

273
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:26,075
How come we're
not all heading for it together?

274
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,903
The bigger the group,
the slower it moves.

275
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,134
All right. I could use another pair
of hands.

276
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,347
Take whoever you want.

277
00:17:32,322 --> 00:17:34,565
How about it, freckles?
Know anything about sailing?

278
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:36,555
I know enough.

279
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,098
Good. We'll be waitin' for ya.
Sayid, you got a minute?

280
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,786
Can you give me a
hand with somethin'?

281
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,420
Listen up, 'cause I'm
only gonna say this once.

282
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,097
<i>We're not going to that
rendezvous point to pick up Locke.</i>

283
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:04,588
I got a deal with Widmore.

284
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,223
What kind of deal?

285
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:08,304
Just listen. First chance you get,

286
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:10,491
You double back,
hoof it to this spot.

287
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,125
There's an old dock.

288
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,726
Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus.
Kate and I will meet you there.

289
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,694
What about Sayid and Claire?

290
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,544
Sayid's a zombie
and Claire's nuts.

291
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:20,465
She gave up her ticket when
she tried to kill Kate,

292
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,808
And I ain't gonna let
that happen again.

293
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:27,489
That's Hugo, Sun and the pilot.
Only them. Understand?

294
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:30,312
But how am I supposed to get
us away from--from Locke?

295
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,879
You figure it out.

296
00:18:38,673 --> 00:18:39,990
Ready to roll?

297
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:43,271
- What was that all about?
- Guy talk.

298
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,521
I need you to go out to
where I've got Desmond.

299
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,888
I thought you weren't
going to give him back.

300
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:56,604
I'm not.

301
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,824
You're gonna kill him.

302
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:01,509
And that's not gonna be
a problem, is it, Sayid?

303
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,097
You do still want

304
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,620
 what you asked me for, right?

305
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:09,731
Yes, I do.

306
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,419
Then go do what I said.

307
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:37,586
So what did he offer ya?

308
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:48,257
If you're gonna shoot me
in cold blood, brother...

309
00:19:51,468 --> 00:19:53,834
I think I have a right to know what
you're gettin' in exchange for it.

310
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:59,213
He told me I could get
something back I lost.

311
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:01,993
And what did you lose?

312
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,555
The woman I loved.

313
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:10,813
And where is she now?

314
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:14,080
Dead.

315
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,908
And what makes you think
Locke can bring her back?

316
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:20,601
I died...

317
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,655
<i>And he brought me back.</i>

318
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,563
So what will you tell her?

319
00:20:33,272 --> 00:20:34,653
What do you mean?

320
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:40,990
This woman--

321
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:44,450
When she asks you what you
did to be with her again...

322
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,129
What will you tell her?

323
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:06,799
Sayid.

324
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:09,938
What's going on?

325
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,256
Everything will be
okay for you now.

326
00:21:13,258 --> 00:21:14,928
I took care of it.

327
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,895
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

328
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,548
I have to leave.

329
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:22,023
Did you hurt someone?

330
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,989
Nadia, I'm leaving,

331
00:21:25,602 --> 00:21:27,596
And I'm never going to be
able to come back again.

332
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,504
What did you do, Sayid?

333
00:21:34,852 --> 00:21:36,222
Stall them.

334
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,104
Who is it?

335
00:21:45,224 --> 00:21:46,149
L.A.P.D.

336
00:21:46,401 --> 00:21:48,299
May I see some identification?

337
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,739
Can you open the door, please?

338
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,118
Mrs. Jarrah,
I'm Detective Straume.

339
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,218
I need to ask you some questions.
You have a few minutes?

340
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:15,532
That's good. Stay down.

341
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:17,923
Sayid Jarrah?

342
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,757
You're under arrest.

343
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,512
There she blows.

344
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,653
You ready to get wet?

345
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:38,767
Oh.

346
00:22:39,065 --> 00:22:40,674
You sure this is a good idea?

347
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:42,368
You see a bridge?

348
00:22:43,017 --> 00:22:44,818
Going back to get Locke.

349
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:48,061
Of course not. It's a terrible idea,
which is why we ain't doing it.

350
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,551
What?

351
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,263
We're gonna ditch Locke.

352
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,978
You, me, Jack, Hurley,
Sun and that pilot

353
00:22:54,027 --> 00:22:56,592
that looks like he's stepped off the set
of a Burt Reynolds movie.

354
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,042
When were you planning
on telling me this?

355
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,988
Now.

356
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,521
Wait. You didn't say Claire.

357
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,179
'cause she ain't comin'.

358
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:10,100
The Claire you came
back for is gone.

359
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,465
I promised I would bring her back.

360
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:17,867
That was before she started
drinkin' Locke's kool-aid.

361
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,654
She's dangerous.
You really want her around Aaron?

362
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:28,658
Let's go. We ain't got much time.

363
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:04,479
Hey, Claire.

364
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,053
Jack.

365
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:14,825
How long have you been with Locke?

366
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,084
Ever since you left.

367
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,483
So you trust him?

368
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,235
Yeah.

369
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,665
Why?

370
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,173
'cause he's the only one
that didn't abandon me.

371
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,154
Sun, have you seen Sayid?

372
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,976
He was supposed to catch up with
us about a half a mile back.

373
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,646
Oh, the silent treatment?

374
00:24:57,988 --> 00:25:00,679
I'm sorry, Sun, but I
didn't do anything to you.

375
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,505
James should be on his way by now.

376
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,878
Just keep everyone moving to the beach.
I'll catch up with you there.

377
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,926
- Where are you going?
- I wanna make sure nobody got left behind.

378
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:18,333
Hurley, wait up. Yeah?

379
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:19,445
Sun.

380
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:27,162
We have to go now.

381
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:28,723
- Go where?
- There's no time.

382
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:29,969
We just gotta go. Follow me.

383
00:25:29,981 --> 00:25:32,311
Um, I think we should
stick to Sawyer's plan,

384
00:25:32,332 --> 00:25:35,015
- Or he'll be really pissed.
- This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go.

385
00:25:53,616 --> 00:25:54,961
Sayid?

386
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,907
Where have you been?

387
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,241
Doing what you asked.

388
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:01,452
Then what took you so long?

389
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,796
I just shot an unarmed man.

390
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:06,259
I needed a moment.

391
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,779
Did you kill him, Sayid?

392
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:11,022
Of course I did.

393
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,881
Go and check, if you like.

394
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:20,199
Come on. We have a boat to catch.

395
00:26:39,134 --> 00:26:40,576
I hope you know
where you're going,

396
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,267
'Cause that smoke thing runs
a hell of a lot faster than we do.

397
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:45,798
Sawyer said there'd be a dock around
here somewhere.

398
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:47,155
There they are!

399
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,937
Hey.

400
00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:57,258
All right. Let's go.
Everybody onboard. Let's go!

401
00:26:57,378 --> 00:27:00,237
- We sailin' home on this, huh?
- Won't work, not without a bearing.

402
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:03,717
For three years, the only way dharma folk
ever got on or off this island was by sub,

403
00:27:03,837 --> 00:27:06,377
So that's what we're doing.
Nice job, doc.

404
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,606
Uh-oh.

405
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:16,144
Where you going?

406
00:27:19,026 --> 00:27:20,251
Claire...

407
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:23,242
It's okay.

408
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:24,784
Kate.

409
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:28,478
We're leaving the island.

410
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,010
Then, uh, why aren't
you waiting for John?

411
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,191
Because that's not John, and...

412
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,559
whoever he is,
he's not one of us.

413
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,286
Claire...

414
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:42,532
Come with us.

415
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,887
I can get you back to Aaron.

416
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,393
- Wait a damn min--
- Sawyer, shut up.

417
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,531
She is coming or I'm not.

418
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,573
Come with us, Claire.

419
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,846
<i>- John promised me--
- No, I'm promising you.</i>

420
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,799
I was there when he was born.

421
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,363
<i>And I never should've raised him.</i>

422
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:08,417
It should've been you.

423
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:14,774
I came back to get you so
you could be with him again.

424
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:18,184
It's the only reason I came
back to the island, Claire.

425
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:22,060
So, please, come with us.

426
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:25,195
Let's go home.

427
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,946
All right. Get on the boat
before Locke gets here.

428
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,992
He finds out we're gone...

429
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:52,017
He's gonna be mad.

430
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:04,159
It's your mom.

431
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:05,799
Hey.

432
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:07,913
Yeah, we just got here.

433
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:10,567
Thank you.

434
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:12,536
Uh... I don't know.

435
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,385
I'll have him home as soon as I can.
Maybe, like, 5:00?

436
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:20,440
Actually, um, we might grab
a bite to eat afterwards, so...

437
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:22,440
Uh... Maybe more like 7:00?

438
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:24,541
All right.

439
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:25,948
Yeah.

440
00:29:26,236 --> 00:29:27,609
Yeah, I'll drop him off.

441
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,447
Hey.

442
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:36,239
You know, hearing
your grandfather's will being read,

443
00:29:36,255 --> 00:29:38,085
I know it's not the
most fun, but...

444
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,318
It'll be over soon, I promise.

445
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,889
And it's--it's okay to be sad.

446
00:29:44,114 --> 00:29:45,805
<i>I'm sad for you, dad.</i>

447
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:51,992
Let's go.

448
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:54,599
Mr. Shephard.

449
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,294
Hello.

450
00:29:57,414 --> 00:29:59,468
- And you must be David.
- Hi.

451
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,951
We're set up in the
conference room.

452
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:04,353
I've got a surprise for you.

453
00:30:05,197 --> 00:30:06,710
Do you believe in fate?

454
00:30:12,338 --> 00:30:14,048
This is Claire Littleton.

455
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:17,318
Claire, this is Mr. Shephard 
and his son David.

456
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:21,387
Hello. I'm--I'm Jack Shephard.

457
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:24,118
Hi, it's, uh, it's
really nice to meet you.

458
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,058
- You found her.
- Actually, she found us.

459
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:31,597
Uh...

460
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:34,949
You were in my father's will.

461
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,868
Do you mind if I ask
you how you knew him?

462
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,706
He was my father, too.

463
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,616
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
This is the, uh, this is the service.

464
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,729
Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard.

465
00:31:12,846 --> 00:31:14,780
No, no, it's not a very good time.

466
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,913
Yes, they can go ahead and prep him.
I'm 20 minutes away.

467
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:26,162
I'm so sorry. There's been
an emergency at the hospital,

468
00:31:26,282 --> 00:31:27,531
And, um...

469
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:31,626
We're gonna have to reschedule.

470
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:51,590
I know I'm a little late
to the party, Captain,

471
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,992
But you mind filling us in
on what your game plan is?

472
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:57,447
My plan, Chesty,
is to land on hydra island,

473
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,418
Get ourselves nice and
cuddly with Widmore

474
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:02,318
Until we get a chance
to jump on that sub.

475
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,234
Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's
face and make 'em take us home.

476
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:08,784
I like that idea.

477
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:12,840
I saw some canned food down
in the gallery. Anybody else starvin'?

478
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,460
Freckles. Take the wheel a minute?

479
00:32:23,006 --> 00:32:23,961
Sure.

480
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:28,977
- Be nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

481
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,309
Didn't think you'd show up, doc.

482
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:42,033
Sorry?

483
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,260
Taking orders ain't
your strong suit.

484
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:46,230
Nice to see you
finally came around.

485
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,130
This doesn't feel right.

486
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,328
What doesn't feel right?

487
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,611
Leaving the island.

488
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,059
You wanna tell me why not?

489
00:33:06,327 --> 00:33:08,562
Because I remember how I
felt last time I left...

490
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,966
Like a part of me was missing.

491
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:15,202
They got pills for that, doc.

492
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,568
We were brought here because
we're supposed to do something, James.

493
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,240
And if locke-- that...

494
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:23,889
That thing-- Wants us to leave?

495
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:27,509
<i>Maybe it's afraid of what
happens if we stay.</i>

496
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:33,456
Get off my damn boat.

497
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:35,774
What?

498
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:38,242
You got a decision to
make and you make it now.

499
00:33:38,426 --> 00:33:39,595
Either you're with us,

500
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:42,681
You keep that damn crazy talk to yourself,
or you're going in the water.

501
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,809
James, this is a mistake.

502
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,336
And I know there's a part
of you that feels that.

503
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:50,312
The island is not
done with us yet.

504
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:52,261
Yeah, well,
I'm done with this island.

505
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,360
So if you wanna take a leap of faith,
Jack, then take it.

506
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:59,636
Get off my damn boat.

507
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,358
I'm sorry that I
got Juliet killed.

508
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:32,451
Jack?!

509
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,576
Jack?!

510
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:40,104
- What did you say to him?
- He changed his mind.

511
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:42,064
What do you mean,
he changed his mind?!

512
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:44,173
- What did you say to him?
- He ain't comin' with us.

513
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,786
We have to go back and get him.

514
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:50,829
We're done going back, Kate.

515
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:11,492
So all these years, you had no idea your
dad had another kid?

516
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,460
Nope. None.

517
00:36:14,019 --> 00:36:16,878
Wow. I can't believe he
never even mentioned her.

518
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:20,433
Yeah, well, your grandfather
kept a lot of things to himself.

519
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:21,898
Is that where you get it from?

520
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,043
Yeah, probably.

521
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:27,596
All right. Uh...

522
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,972
You gonna be okay hangin' while
I do this?

523
00:36:30,026 --> 00:36:31,203
Uh, yeah, sure.

524
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:33,665
Good luck, dad.

525
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,223
Thanks.

526
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,447
Car V. Ped.

527
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,221
- How bad?
- Bad.

528
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:50,615
But here's the kicker--

529
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,230
The victim was already
in a wheelchair.

530
00:36:52,273 --> 00:36:53,737
Preexisting spinal condition.

531
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,990
Dural sac's obliterated.

532
00:36:57,857 --> 00:37:00,031
That's why we called you.
We're in a bit over our heads here.

533
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,639
Yeah.

534
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,060
I got this.

535
00:37:12,928 --> 00:37:14,700
We ready to cut? Say the word.

536
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,802
Scalpel.

537
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:29,375
What is it?

538
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:32,118
I think I know this guy.

539
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:51,172
Nice day for a swim.

540
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,621
Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?

541
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,707
Yeah.

542
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:21,639
Everybody stay close.
The camp's over here.

543
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,055
We're not gonna have much time

544
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:27,025
Before Locke's figured out
we made off with his ride.

545
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:29,339
Hands up! Hey! Whoa!

546
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,678
- Whoa! Take it easy!
- Drop your weapons! Drop 'em now!

547
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:44,195
It's all right. I know him.

548
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:46,156
Who else is with you?

549
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:47,770
Nobody!

550
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:49,018
If you're
wondering where Locke is,

551
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,638
He's still back on
the main island.

552
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,248
Turn the fences off.

553
00:38:54,477 --> 00:38:57,047
Ford just showed up on a boat
with five of his friends.

554
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:04,455
Sun?

555
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:08,083
Jin?

556
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:14,150
- Jin!
- Sun!

557
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,091
I love you.

558
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,866
I love you, too.

559
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:36,608
I never stopped looking for you.

560
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:39,638
Looks like someone
got their voice back.

561
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:42,978
We'll never be apart again.

562
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,493
I promise you.

563
00:39:57,631 --> 00:39:59,168
Are you sure?

564
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,963
I-I understand, Charles.

565
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,236
That Widmore?

566
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,576
What the hell are you doin'?

567
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,002
What's it look like I'm doin'?
Hands up now.

568
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:16,687
On your knees, all of you!

569
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,807
Down!

570
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:25,724
- We had a deal!
- Deal's off.

571
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:30,234
We got 'em.

572
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:33,081
If you've got a sightline on Locke,
fire when ready.

573
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,102
Roger.

574
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,666
<i>Get down!</i>

575
00:41:06,414 --> 00:41:08,901
Jack? You all right?

576
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:12,784
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

577
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,740
You're with me now.

578
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:23,232
