So explain this.

What good does that do me?

155
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,867
We need you. You have work to do.

156
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,929
Starting with helping your father.

157
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,535
- My father's dead.
- Doesn't mean you can't help him.

158
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,078
Will you go with us, Walt?

159
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,899
Come on, it's OK.

160
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:16,946
You ride shotgun.

161
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,123
[Hurley] Dude.

162
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,389
- Hurley.
- It's great to see you, Walt.

163
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,866
I kept hoping one day somebody
would come back for me.

164
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,731
They said I was crazy.

165
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,343
You're not crazy, dude.

166
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,937
Not even close.

167
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,705
You just need to get back to the island,
that's all. It's where you belong.

168
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,912
It's where you've always belonged.

169
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,023
Why?

170
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,195
I wanna talk to you about a job.

171
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,832
All right, Ben,
let's get out of here.

172
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,860
It's time for us all to go home.

173
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,031
