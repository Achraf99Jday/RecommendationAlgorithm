1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,712
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,030
I was in a wheelchair,
paralyzed for four years.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,759
This island, it changed me,
it made me whole.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,876
I'm so thankful for you, John.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,712
You stole my kidney.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,950
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,508
And that's what happened.
Get over it.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,999
I don't care what Jack said.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,389
They've got him.
We have to get him back. I owe him.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,278
- How'd you get onto this island?
- On the submarine.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,397
So your people, they can just
come and go whenever they want?

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,153
You never know when
a little C-4 might come in handy.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,839
Jack!

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,513
- Name?
- John Locke.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,158
Marital status, Mr. Locke?

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,319
Single.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,870
- Girlfriend?
- No.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,399
Are your parents living?

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,911
I was raised in foster care.
I never really knew my parents.

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,070
Have you ever considered
seeking out your biological parents?

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,918
I don't see how that's relevant.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,878
It's relevant because
if the government's gonna continue

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,757
paying your disability insurance,

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,116
I have to figure out whether or not
your condition has improved.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,551
So, how's your appetite?

26
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,429
Fine.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,713
You stopped submitting
therapy bills for reimbursement.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,552
It's 'cause I stopped going.

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,551
Waste of time.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,757
It's just a temporary suspension.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,991
As soon as you resume your sessions,
you can re-apply.

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,868
- You think I'm temporarily disabled?
- Depression can be temporary.

33
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,748
Since you see fit to stop going
to therapy, I guess you're all better.

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,119
Guess I am.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,319
Next.

36
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,232
What is he doing?

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,315
Good hands!

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,470
I'll be right there.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,159
Jack!

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,308
She's the one who helped
me and Sawyer escape.

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,076
It's gonna be tomorrow.

44
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,799
This is gonna be more complicated
than we thought.

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,512
So we simply start shooting people
and hope for the best?

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,876
- We came to rescue Jack.
- Obviously, circumstances have changed.

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,236
- He may not want to be rescued.
- That is not him. That's not Jack.

48
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,437
They did something to him.
When they captured us they drugged us.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,114
- He didn't appear to be drugged.
- They kidnapped him.

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,474
He wouldn't forget that.

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,313
I agree. Until we know why
we're putting our lives at risk.

52
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,436
- I'm not leaving.
- We may not have a choice.

53
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,112
It's Jack.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,188
The first time I saw him,
he was risking his life,

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,875
pulling people out
of burning airplane wreckage.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,872
If he's shaking hands with The Others,
he has a good reason.

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,350
We just have to go down there
and find out what it is.

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,436
- What do you suggest?
- Wait till dark.

59
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,034
We approach Jack when he's alone.

60
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,351
And if he wants out, we get him out.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,633
<i>Here's what we know, Crystal.</i>

62
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,952
<i>The Bolivian gold deposits were stolen
last night around 2:00 a. m.</i>

63
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,157
<i>Autumn, that means
The Cobra, he's back!</i>

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,196
<i>Get down!</i>

65
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,838
<i>Have you been shot?</i>

66
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,273
<i>I can't find him.</i>

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,476
<i>There. Behind Winged Victory.</i>

68
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,357
<i>- I can see his arms.
- I can get him.</i>

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,199
Hello. John Locke?

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,878
I'm sorry. No solicitors.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,631
- I have a sign.
- I'm not... I'm not trying to sell...

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,188
Listen, my name's Peter Talbot.

73
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,952
I just need to talk to you.

74
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,109
Talk about what?

75
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,316
My mother, actually.

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,396
- I think she might be in some trouble.
- You got the wrong John Locke.

77
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,357
How many kidneys do you have?

78
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,037
She met him two months ago.

79
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,236
Love at first sight is what she said.

80
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,278
The guy was charming, sweet, funny.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,513
His name's Adam Seward.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,478
He's a retired computer entrepreneur
from Ontario.

83
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,197
Anyway, Adam had something special.

84
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,953
My mom jut went ga-ga for him
right out of the gate.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,157
After two months of knowing him,
she agrees to marry the guy.

86
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,390
Something about him...

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,199
Something in my gut told me
that he was after something,

88
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,191
so I had to check him out.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,918
I'm not sure I know what any of this
has to do with me.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,594
What this has to do with you, Mr. Locke,

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,752
is that you donated one of your kidneys
to Adam Seward.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,594
Only his name was different back then.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,955
He used to be Anthony Cooper.

94
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,358
All I could find
were his medical records.

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,752
And I saw he was the recipient
of a kidney transplant from you.

96
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,436
So I figured, hey, if someone gave
the guy his kidney, how bad could he be?

97
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,393
Right?

98
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,317
Well, it was an anonymous donation.

99
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,799
I never met him.

100
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,832
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,713
Sayid, you guard the front.

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,598
I'll cover the back.
You head in through the side door.

103
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,478
- I'm going in alone?
- Better if you're the first he sees.

104
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,278
All right.

105
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,508
Hi.

106
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,550
- What are you doing here?
- I came to get you.

107
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,473
Get out of here right now. Go.

108
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,596
- Jack.
- Kate, they're watching me!

109
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,512
- Get out.
- I'm not leaving you.

110
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,830
- Get down.
- Don't hurt her. Don't hurt her.

111
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,071
Step back, Doc. Step back!

112
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,958
- Hold him still.
- Jack!

113
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,398
- Jack!
- Who else is with you?

114
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,278
- Jack!
- Just answer the question, Kate.

115
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,278
OK, one more time.

116
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,793
Who else is with you?

117
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,958
Nobody.

118
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,395
Nobody else. It was just us.

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,397
Alex?

120
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,511
- John.
- Keep your voice down.

121
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,839
All right.

122
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,197
It's all right, John.
You don't have to point the gun at me.

123
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,398
- I can tell you where Jack is.
- I'm not looking for Jack.

124
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,436
I'm looking for the submarine.

125
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,794
The submarine.

126
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,074
Where is it?

127
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,116
I'm not sure what you mean, John.

128
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,428
What submarine?

129
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,273
The one you use to travel
to and from the island.

130
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,034
The one your man Mikhail told me about
right before I killed him.

131
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,956
- Dad? Who are you talking to?
- Alex, don't come in here.

132
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,795
- Tell her to be quiet.
- Alex, please.

133
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,080
- Ben, you awake?
- No, no!

134
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,719
I'm coming in.

135
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,031
What is it?

136
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,634
It's Austen and Jarrah.
They're here.

137
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,312
Somehow they found us.

138
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,316
- Where are they now?
- We captured them.

139
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,755
We're holding them at my place.
Want me to help you?

140
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,400
No. Separate them.
I want to know how they found us.

141
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,550
What about Juliet
and Shephard tomorrow?

142
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,995
- Let me worry about that. Just go.
- Got it.

143
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,155
- Richard, wait a minute.
- I'll wait outside.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,468
I want you to bring me
the man from Tallahassee.

145
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,230
- What do you need him for?
- Just do it.

146
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,117
- Now.
- OK.

147
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,520
The man from Tallahassee?
What is that?

148
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,874
Some kind of code?

149
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,872
No, we don't have a code
for "there's a man in my closet

150
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,791
with a gun to my daughter's head".

151
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,633
Although we obviously should.

152
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,917
Sayid, he had a pack with him.

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,316
I want her to retrieve it.

154
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,869
OK, but you should know, John,
my daughter currently hates me.

155
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,599
I'm not sure holding me hostage
is your best option.

156
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,669
Dad!

157
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,555
I'll get your bag.

158
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,150
I'm looking for something
really stunning.

159
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,471
Something that would grab
everyone's attention on the table.

160
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,757
Honey, what do you think of this one?

161
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,517
That looks good. What do you think?

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,955
I like it. Maybe just a little larger.

163
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,675
Yeah.

164
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,395
Larger would be good.
I'll go over there and take a look.

165
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,559
Hello, John.

166
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,677
Is there gonna be a big to-do,
or just two of you and a preacher?

167
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,791
I guess you couldn't invite me.

168
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,474
That would make
for awkward introductions.

169
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,913
How did you know I was?

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,357
I know because her son came to me
and asked why I gave you a kidney.

171
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,755
He's on to you,
but he doesn't have any proof,

172
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,752
so he came to me,
hoping I would vouch for you.

173
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,751
What did you say to him?

174
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,038
You're conning her, aren't you?

175
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,516
You're gonna marry her
for her money, right?

176
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,717
- What is it you want, John?
- I want you to end it.

177
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,869
I want you to call off the wedding.

178
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,469
- Why are you doing this?
- Because. Because it's not fair.

179
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,918
You make people think
that you're their family.

180
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,070
And then you leave their life in ruins.

181
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,720
And I'm not gonna let you do it again.

182
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,189
You're gonna call off
your engagement and go,

183
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,390
or I'm gonna tell her the truth.

184
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,639
I want to hear you say it.

185
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,439
You say you're gonna leave.

186
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,032
OK, John.

187
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,432
You got it.

188
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,074
Would you mind helping me
get into my chair?

189
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,072
No tricks. I promise.

190
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,036
I just want some dignity.

191
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,154
You, of all people, should understand
what it means to want some dignity.

192
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,793
Thank you.

193
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,239
So, tell me, John, how do you expect
to pilot our submarine?

194
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,515
It's a complicated piece of machinery.

195
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,229
- You don't just press "submerge".
- I'll figure something out.

196
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,750
For all you know,
I was a commander in the Navy.

197
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,553
Put your arm around my neck
and I'll lift under your knees.

198
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,551
What's in the pack, John?

199
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,518
If you met Mikhail, that means
you were in the communications station.

200
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,636
Which means you found the explosives.

201
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,475
So you're not planning to pilot
the submarine anywhere, are you?

202
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,952
You're planning to destroy it.

203
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,951
I know you, John Locke.

204
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,396
You don't know me at all.

205
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,040
I know you were born in California.

206
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,313
I know you were raised in foster care.

207
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,073
I know you wasted a big part
of your life in Tustin,

208
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,596
pushing papers at a company
that manufactured industrial boxes.

209
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,592
You spent the four years prior
to your arrival on this island

210
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,238
in a wheelchair.

211
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,709
And I know how you ended up in it.

212
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,553
Tell me, John,

213
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,878
did it hurt?

214
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,756
I felt my back break.

215
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,918
What do you think?

216
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,390
I didn't think
I'd see you again so soon, Kate.

217
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,150
Be careful in here.

218
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,912
Thanks.

219
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,398
Did they hurt you?

220
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,473
No.

221
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,879
Did they hurt you?

222
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,759
No.

223
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,193
What is all this?

224
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,518
This is where they live.

225
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,279
And the people they took?

226
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,795
- The kids?
- They're all safe.

227
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,719
Safe?

228
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,150
So you're with them now?

229
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,555
I'm not "with" anyone, Kate.

230
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,111
What did they do to you?

231
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,676
- Nothing.
- Why are you acting like this?

232
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,433
There's no way...

233
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,117
- There's no way I could...
- I came here to help you! Why?

234
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,634
I told you not to come back here for me!

235
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,151
I didn't think you meant it.

236
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,991
What did they do to you, Jack?

237
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,998
I made a deal with them.

238
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,918
They're gonna let me go.

239
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,231
Where?

240
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,553
Home.

241
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,873
- When?
- First thing in the morning.

242
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,792
- I'll bring help. It's our best chance.
- You trust these people? They're liars.

243
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,553
I trust them
because you told me to, Kate.

244
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,710
When you asked me to save Sawyer's life.

245
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,474
Jack.

246
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,077
What did they tell you?

247
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,600
Jack, we need to go.

248
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,952
I'll be right there.

249
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,319
I asked you not to come back here
for me and I wish...

250
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,837
I wish that you hadn't.

251
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,317
But I will come back here for you.

252
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,717
- John Locke?
- Yeah.

253
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,950
Detective Mason.
That's Detective Reed.

254
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,076
Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

255
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,516
- No, of course not.
- Do you know a man named Peter Talbot?

256
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,877
- No, I don't think so.
- Thin, brown hair, 20's.

257
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,950
If it will be helpful we believe
he was in your apartment two days ago.

258
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,553
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

259
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,916
Yeah, he was a solicitor.
I sent him away.

260
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,437
Mr. Talbot's family's worth somewhere
in the neighbourhood of $200 million.

261
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,956
So I'm curious. What exactly
was he selling you door-to-door?

262
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,712
Look, I told you I don't know him.

263
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,076
Why was your name and address
on a piece of paper in his pocket?

264
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,874
Why would you be looking
through his pockets?

265
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,351
Because Peter Talbot's dead.

266
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,356
It wasn't easy, you know.

267
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,870
Being in that hatch with you
all that time.

268
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,713
Knowing you had no business
walking around.

269
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,679
Knowing I couldn't ask you about it
without telling you who I really was.

270
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,988
So ask me now.

271
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,789
Now that I know who you really are.

272
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,997
Was it immediate?
It started the moment you got here?

273
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,472
- Yeah.
- And you were walking?

274
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,755
The feeling returned
right after the crash?

275
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,354
That's what "immediate" means, Ben.

276
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,999
You're wondering
why it hasn't happened for you.

277
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,592
You're not recovering
as fast as you'd like.

278
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,558
How long's it been
since Jack fixed you? A week?

279
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,189
Now that I think about it,
how did you get sick in the first place?

280
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,990
Are you afraid it will go away, John?
Is that why you want to destroy the sub?

281
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,073
Because you know if you ever leave
this island you'll be back in the chair?

282
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,837
You got anything to eat?

283
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,309
Hey.

284
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,356
Go on home, kid. You know
you're not supposed to be here.

285
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,431
My father sent me to get his pack.

286
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,068
Why?

287
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,355
I don't know why,
but he told me to get it.

288
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,753
All right.

289
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,674
Here you go.

290
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,233
You're Alex, aren't you?

291
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,792
Hey, can it.

292
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,630
How do you know my name?

293
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,950
Because you look like your mother.

294
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,794
My mother is dead.

295
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,591
I'm sure that's what they told you.

296
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,553
Get going, Alex.

297
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,392
Keep your mouth shut.

298
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,238
Where do you get electricity?

299
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,869
We have two giant hamsters running
in a massive wheel at our secret lab.

300
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,473
That's funny.

301
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,192
There's leftovers in the refrigerator.
Help yourself.

302
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,276
I ate most of the dark meat. Sorry.

303
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,031
I never really appreciated chicken
until right now.

304
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,116
I know you think
you need to do this, John,

305
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,510
but if you blow up my submarine
I have a big problem with my people.

306
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,114
Is that supposed to be an incentive
not to blow it up?

307
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,313
I was born on this island.

308
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,311
Not many of my people can say that.

309
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,709
Most of them were recruited
and brought here.

310
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,679
As much as they love this place
or would do anything to defend it,

311
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,320
they need to know they can leave
if they want to.

312
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,228
The sub maintains that illusion.

313
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,108
- So you're lying to them.
- They're here because they want to be.

314
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,317
Some of them are just not ready
to make a full commitment yet.

315
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,788
But you, John...

316
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,595
...you've already made that commitment
and now you have a choice.

317
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,070
Because if you stop and if you think,
I can show you things.

318
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,837
Things I know you want
to see very badly.

319
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,516
Let me put it so you'll understand.

320
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,399
Picture a box.

321
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,154
You know something about boxes,
don't you, John?

322
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,754
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island

323
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,400
there's a very large box?

324
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,989
And whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

325
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,629
when you opened that box,
there it would be.

326
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,150
What would you say about that, John?

327
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,593
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

328
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,629
- Why are you so angry?
- You're cheating. You and your people.

329
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,792
Communicate with the outside world
whenever you want to,

330
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,677
you come and go as you please,

331
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,274
you use electricity
and running water and guns.

332
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,634
You're a hypocrite.

333
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,632
A Pharisee.
You don't deserve to be on this island.

334
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,271
If you had any idea
what this place really was,

335
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,272
you wouldn't be putting chicken
in your refrigerator!

336
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,830
You've been here 80 days, John.
I've been here my entire life.

337
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,116
How is it that you think you know
this island better than I do?

338
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,839
Because you're in the wheelchair...

339
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,789
...and I'm not.

340
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,878
Did you have any problems?

341
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,911
OK, here's how this is gonna work.

342
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,833
She's gonna take me to the sub.
Once we're there I let her go.

343
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,797
She's done enough.
Let me take you.

344
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,110
I don't want you to slow me down.

345
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,672
Come on, let's go.

346
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,595
John, before you go you should know...

347
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,238
Jack and I made a deal.

348
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,792
In less than an hour
he's leaving this island on that sub,

349
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,279
and it's a one-way ticket.

350
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,476
The anomaly wiped out
our communications.

351
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,949
We have no way of contacting
the outside world.

352
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,959
Which means when that sub leaves,
it can never come back.

353
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,434
Whether you destroy the sub or let it go
the end result is the same.

354
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,471
No one will find this island.

355
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,353
Let's go.

356
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,353
Come on.

357
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,275
You know he's manipulating you, right?

358
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,509
How's that?

359
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,319
That's what my father does.
He manipulates people.

360
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,314
He makes you think it's your idea,
but it's his.

361
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,630
I'll have to keep that in mind.

362
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,236
The submarine's down there.

363
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,436
At the end of the dock.

364
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,509
I'm sorry I had to involve you in this.

365
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,799
Look, I know you don't owe me anything.

366
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,314
But I need to ask you
for one last favour.

367
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,077
You don't knock?

368
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,832
I need you to let my friends go.

369
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,397
After I'm gone.

370
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,517
And if I said no,
would that stop you from leaving?

371
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,158
Of course it would.

372
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,749
Your friends are only here
to rescue you.

373
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,037
But you seem to be doing a good job
of rescuing yourself, so...

374
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,353
...I suppose there's no reason
to keep them here.

375
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,749
Do I have your word on that?

376
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,239
You have my word.

377
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,591
I'll let them go
just as soon as you've left the island.

378
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,351
Well, I guess this is it.

379
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,477
Thank you, Ben,

380
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,635
for keeping your promise.

381
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,351
Hey, hold it right there.

382
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,715
Get your hands up.
Get down!

383
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,711
I said get down.

384
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,355
What are you doing here, John?

385
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,670
I'm sorry, Jack.

386
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,070
Sorry for what?

387
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,271
- What did you do?
- John.

388
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,871
Tell me. Tell me you didn't do it.

389
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,157
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me you didn't kill that kid.

390
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,712
What? You think I had something
to do with Peter's death?

391
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,837
I tell you to end things with his mother
and then he's dead.

392
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,718
John, calm down, please.
Think about what you're saying.

393
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,995
- Why would I kill Peter?
- He was on to you.

394
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,755
I've been doing this for a long time.
I'm not sweating some rich kid.

395
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,319
- Why are you still here?
- What?

396
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,039
I tell you to leave.
You tell me you're gonna leave.

397
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,236
Why are you still here?

398
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,312
Listen, John, I'll be honest with you.

399
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,590
I didn't end it.
I was looking for an angle.

400
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,148
I wanted to make some money
before I skipped out.

401
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,798
But then all this happened.

402
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,156
Peter died and everything
just went straight into the tank.

403
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,996
She's devastated.

404
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,798
She's called off the wedding.

405
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,348
There's no profit in it, John.

406
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,034
I'm a con man, not a murderer.

407
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,438
She called off the wedding?

408
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,751
She said she couldn't deal with it.

409
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,990
- She needs to be alone.
- So if I were to call her right now,

410
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,117
that's what she would tell me?

411
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,357
Phone's right over there, John.

412
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,079
What's her number?

413
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,396
Mr. Locke, we know
this isn't what you want to hear,

414
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,277
but your father's gone.

415
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,117
We know he fled to Mexico
shortly after your encounter,

416
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,191
then he disappeared.

417
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,752
I'm sorry, but he could be
anywhere in the world right now.

418
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,914
All right, detectives. That's enough.
Mr. Locke has work to do today.

419
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,235
We'll let you know if anything develops.

420
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,038
John, John, John.

421
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,156
We have got ourselves
quite a day ahead of us, my friend.

422
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,273
A fine time to get you out of bed.

423
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,635
No, I don't want to.

424
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,188
I don't remember asking.

425
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,758
Now, most people struggle
with this at first.

426
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,071
But don't worry.
You'll get used to it.

427
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,117
No, no, please.
I can't do this.

428
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,670
John, you fell eight stories
and survived, OK?

429
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,832
I don't want to hear about
what you can't do. Let's go.

430
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,638
- It's gonna be all right.
- No.

431
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,631
It's gonna be fine, John. Come on.

432
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,873
You're fine.

433
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,839
Here we go.

434
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,797
There you go, buddy.

435
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,991
That wasn't that bad, was it?

436
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,230
I'll be right back, buddy.

437
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,469
Well, John, you've really
gone and done it now.

438
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,911
You don't have to pretend
to be disappointed anymore.

439
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,355
We both know you wanted it to happen.

440
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,635
That's why you left the C-4
in Sayid's bag,

441
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,473
because you wanted me
to make it happen.

442
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,511
Uncuff him, please, Richard.

443
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,157
You gonna do anything stupid?

444
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,355
No, sir.

445
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,632
Do you remember earlier,
when you called me a cheater?

446
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,836
When you said I didn't deserve to live
on this island? Well, get this.

447
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
There I was, shaking hands with Jack,

448
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,758
and thinking I'd give almost anything to
come up with a way to stop him leaving.

449
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,992
Because to let him go would be a sign
of weakness, of failure, of defeat.

450
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,072
My people would see that.
They would know it.

451
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,196
And that, John, would be the end of me.

452
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,838
But to kill him...

453
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,397
That would be cheating.

454
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,189
Because my people also heard me
make a promise, and to break my word,

455
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,675
that would be the end of me too.

456
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,468
And then you came
striding out of the jungle, John.

457
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,198
To make my dream come true.

458
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,996
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

459
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,479
No, John.

460
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,869
I'm gonna show you what came out of it.

461
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,678
When I asked you if it hurt
when you suffered your injury,

462
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,991
I think you misunderstood me.
It seems fairly obvious

463
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,358
when a person's back smashes
after being thrown from a building,

464
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,351
that's gonna sting a little.

465
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,398
But I really wasn't asking
about the physical pain.

466
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,871
You want to know if it hurt my feelings?

467
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,279
No, John.

468
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,194
I wanted to know what it felt like
when your own father tried to kill you.

469
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,998
He's the reason
you destroyed the submarine, isn't he?

470
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,759
You're afraid.

471
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,150
You're afraid of him and this is
the one place he can never find you.

472
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,835
- The one place he can never get to.
- What do you want from me?

473
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,189
I don't know how it happened.

474
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,198
But you seem to have some communion
with this island, John,

475
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,192
and that makes you very, very important.

476
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,030
You have no idea
what you're talking about,

477
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,351
but in time you'll have
a better understanding of things.

478
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,632
So, what do I want?

479
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,118
I want to help you, John.

480
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,389
Why?

481
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,358
Because I'm in a wheelchair
and you're not.

482
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,992
Are you ready to see?

483
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,639
Dad?
