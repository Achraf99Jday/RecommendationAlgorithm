1
00:00:00,458 --> 00:00:02,103
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:03,862
I don't know how it happenned,

3
00:00:04,198 --> 00:00:07,573
But you seem to have
some communion with this island, John.

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,787
and that makes you
very, very important.

5
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:13,720
In time, you'll have a better
understanding of things.

6
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:17,893
Kwon is pregnant.

7
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:19,398
<i>The fetus is healthy...</i>

8
00:00:20,038 --> 00:00:21,072
What's that?

9
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,769
Juliet is gathering information
for us at your former camp.

10
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,082
She's determing
if any of the women are pregnant.

11
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:29,479
Then we're gonna go in and...
take them.

12
00:00:30,316 --> 00:00:31,433
Juliet is a mole.

13
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,283
She's working for Ben.

14
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:36,684
We're moving.

15
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:40,030
- Moving? Where are we going?
- We are not going anywhere, John.

16
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,169
You are going to stay behind.

17
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:44,124
We'll leave a trail...
One you can track.

18
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,592
And, John,

19
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:48,574
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back...

20
00:00:49,996 --> 00:00:51,062
Don't bother.

21
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:58,861
Come on! Damn it, push!

22
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:03,896
Something's wrong.

23
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:05,178
I can't...

24
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:08,956
Emily...

25
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:10,377
You can do this!

26
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:11,574
Now push!

27
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,487
Come on. Come on, baby.

28
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,135
You can do it. Now come on.

29
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,691
Come on.
There you go! Come on!

30
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,504
It's a boy.

31
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:27,824
You did it.

32
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:30,947
It hurts.

33
00:01:38,323 --> 00:01:39,847
Oh, you did it.

34
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,385
Roger, it hurts.

35
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:53,333
Emily,
no one knows we're out here.

36
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,322
We gotta get back, okay, honey?

37
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:57,083
Can you hold on to the baby?

38
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,010
Can you hold the baby?

39
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,322
Hold him tight.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,508
Help! Help!

41
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:19,096
Help!

44
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,109
Hey, what happened, man?

45
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,395
We were hiking.

46
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,641
She went into labor,
and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.

47
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:35,817
Okay, look.
We'll put her in the car, okay?

48
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,667
We're gonna get you to the hospital.

49
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,532
Oh, okay. Okay, honey.

50
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:41,948
Okay, it's all right.
Let's keep her warm. All right?

51
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,718
- How's the baby?
- Fine, I guess. I don't know.

52
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:47,144
Roger...

53
00:02:48,152 --> 00:02:49,394
I'm right here.

54
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,756
Call him benjamin...

55
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:52,711
Stay with me.

56
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,321
Stay with me!

57
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,487
Oh, god, no!

58
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:13,889
What you got there?

59
00:03:14,523 --> 00:03:15,856
It's a birthday present.

60
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,249
Mine just happens to be today.

61
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,651
You do rember birthdays,
isn't you, Richard?

62
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,709
So do you want me to bring
the tape back to Juliet?

63
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:28,976
- What?
- The tape

64
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:30,502
with your instructions for Juliet...

65
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:32,760
Do you want me to bring it back
to the medical station?

66
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,777
I recorded it yesterday
before we left.

67
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,129
I thought you already took it.

68
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,210
Where's Tom?

69
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:44,972
Have you seen my recorder?

70
00:04:10,296 --> 00:04:13,077
You said that if I...
killed my father,

71
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,996
you'd tell me everything
I wanted to know about the island.

72
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:24,511
So why don't you start
at the beginning?

73
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:42,018
Subtitles: swsub.com

74
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,943
I know I promised
to tell you everything,

75
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:49,856
and I wish it was as simple

76
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,533
as me taking out a dusty
old book and opening it up.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,988
But it's not that simple.

78
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,415
How about you just tell me?

79
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:12,521
You probably think I'm the leader
of this little community,

80
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:14,686
but that's not entirely true.

81
00:05:17,103 --> 00:05:18,758
We all answer to someone, John.

82
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:20,278
And who might that be?

83
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:24,041
His name is Jacob.

84
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:26,729
Okay, then.

85
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:27,913
Take me to Jacob.

86
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
I can't do that.

87
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,057
Where are you going?

88
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,368
If you don't want to take me,
maybe someone else will.

89
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,252
I'll just go and ask Richard.

90
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,698
Why would Richard take you?

91
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,099
He doesn't know where Jacob is.
He doesn't talk to Jacob.

92
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,446
- Well, who talks to him?
- I do.

93
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:44,664
- You're the only one who talks to him?
- That's right.

94
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:46,675
And no one else knows where he is?

95
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:49,248
I was born here on this island.

96
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,763
I'm one of the last that was.

97
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,290
Most of these people you see...

98
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:56,575
I brought them here,
so Jacob talks tome, John.

99
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:59,897
He tells me what to do, trusts me.

100
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:04,327
And no one else
has ever seen him?

101
00:06:04,716 --> 00:06:05,854
That's right.

102
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:07,603
How convenient.

103
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,040
You know what I think, Ben?

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,044
I think there is no Jacob.

105
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,539
I think your people are idiots

106
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:17,317
if they believe you take orders
from someone else.

107
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,114
You are
the man behind the curtain...

108
00:06:21,851 --> 00:06:22,906
The Wizard of Oz...

109
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:26,407
And you're a liar.

110
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,094
And what might you base
that theory on, John?

111
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,338
Because if you were telling the truth,

112
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:36,141
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

113
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:14,977
Namaste.

114
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,352
Thanks.

115
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:21,868
Hey,
welcome to the island, man.

116
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:26,106
So what do you think?

117
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,268
Wow, this is some place.

118
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:31,613
Thanks again for
the opportunity, Mr. Goodspeed.

119
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:32,662
Horace, please.

120
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:34,770
And this must be Ben.

121
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:37,802
Yeah. Mr. Goodspeed was there
the day you were born.

122
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,225
Yes, I was.

123
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:41,880
He's doing us a big favor here.

124
00:07:42,227 --> 00:07:43,727
He gave your old man a job.

125
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,477
- Uh, he don't say much.
- That's okay.

126
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:50,550
I bet he will when
he has something to say, right, Ben?

127
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,052
Hey, you hungry, kiddo?

128
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:57,608
Great. All right,
well, I tell you what.

129
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,742
After you're done processing,
we'll have some lunch. How's that sound?

130
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,866
Uh, thank you.

131
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:03,497
You're gonna love it here.

132
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,527
<i>Welcome to the island.</i>

133
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,483
<i>For your own comfort and safety,</i>

134
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,666
<i>we ask that you stay within the confines

135
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:14,915
<i>Our barracks are surrounded
by a high-frequency sonar fence</i>

136
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:20,227
<i>to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.</i>

137

<i>You are now a member
of the Dharma Initiative.</i>

138
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,404
What kind of wildlife you think
this fence is protecting us from?

139
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:27,493
Roger Linus?

140
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,118
<i>Every morning
you will be given a new code</i>

141
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,516
<i>which will allow you

142
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,891

146
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:49,356
<i>Most of you will be working
on the mainland.</i>

147
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:52,136
<i>Should you be assigned
geological study...</i>

148
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:54,102
Hey.

149
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:56,248
You're new, huh?

150
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,492
I'm Annie.

151
00:09:01,553 --> 00:09:02,553
Want one?

152
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:08,214
We can have as many as we want.

153
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:10,557
"Work man"?

154
00:09:11,678 --> 00:09:13,672
What is this?
Workman?

155
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:17,053
I'm a janitor?

156
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,432
I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.

157
00:09:18,604 --> 00:09:20,868
Goodspeed told me you people
were doing experiments,

158
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:21,924
changing the world.

159
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:23,879
I didn't come here
to clean up after you.

160
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,253
Look, if anything else opens up,

161
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:26,875
you can feel free to apply for it.

162
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,557
Come on.

163
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,260
Hey, Sayid.

164
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,477
- What happened to you?
- I was with Locke.

165
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,787
Where is he?

166
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
He went back.

167
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:56,477
Back where?

168
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:58,665
With them.
Don't ask me where the hell it is,

169
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,499
'cause it don't matter right now.

170
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,490
What does matter... is this.

171
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,330
Where is Ben?!

172
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:16,976
Where is he?!

173
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,747
I thought you were dead.

174
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:28,389
I'm fortunate the pylons
were not set to a lethal level.

175
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:33,900
What ishedoing here?

176
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,571
- It's all right.
- He's the one who tried to kill me.

177
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:41,288
He's with us now.

178
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:44,622
Where have you been, Mikhail?

179
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,256
I encountered several
of his people in the jungle.

180
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,978
They had an injured woman with them.

181
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,615
Apparently, she had just
parachuted onto the island.

182
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:55,082
- What?
- Her helo crashed in the water.

183
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:59,180
She says her ship
is approximately 130 clicks

184
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,394
to the west of us.

185
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:03,164
- She has a radio-telephone.
- Where is she now?

186
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,084
I assume they have taken her
back to their camp.

187
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,911
We'll be visiting their camp
day after tomorrow.

188
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:11,089
- We'll take care of it then.
- Day after tomorrow?

189
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,351
We have to go now.

190
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,426
Ben's not going anywhere with you.

191
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,149
- Excuse me?
- He and I are going to see Jacob.

192
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,812
Please tell me
this isn't true, Benjamin.

193
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:36,396
Sorry. I have to deal
with this now, John.

194
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,315
Our excursion will have to wait.

195
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:43,054
Since when do you explain
yourself to him... an outsider?

196
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:04,089
So when do we leave?

197
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,051
You know, you didn't have to beat him
senseless to make your point.

198
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,565
Yes, I did.

199
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,407
I hear you're gonna go see Jacob.

200
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:25,974
You're gonna need this.

201
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:34,948
Thanks.

202
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,246
Happy birthday, dad.

203
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,776
So once water is added
to the bicarbonate,

204
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:03,719
we will get
our very own volcanic reaction.

205
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,447
Yes.

206
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:08,784
Is that what happened
to the volcano onthisisland?

207
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:12,445
Exactly, Annie,
but that was a long time ago.

208
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,121
Okay, let's get ourselves an eruption.

209
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:16,386
Oh, cool!

210
00:13:16,947 --> 00:13:19,185
Just add water, and voilà.

211
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:21,287
Now I know it's not lava, but...

212
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,484
What was that?!

213
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,212
Okay, everyone, into your positions.

214
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,098
Get over here!

215
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,024
That's right, all together.

216
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,462
Annie, lock the back door, please.

217
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,554
Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move.

218
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:51,233
Come on!

219
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,551
Don't worry.
It's just the hostiles.

220
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:02,711
We'll be okay.

221
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,279
Hey, man, I heard
you ran into a little trouble.

222
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,931
We were driving back from the plane,
and we hear this huge explosion.

223
00:14:15,745 --> 00:14:18,016
Next thing I know,
there's a siren wailing,

224
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,182
and we're driving through
the middle of a shootout.

225
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:22,487
Look, we're having some
skirmishes with the natives.

226
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:24,207
What do you mean, natives?

227
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:26,494
We're not exactly sure
who they are.

228
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,919
This ain't what I signed up for.

229
00:14:29,182 --> 00:14:31,186
Roger, I did you a favor, man.

230
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:33,037
You were having trouble finding work,

231
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:36,111
and don't forget about Ben.
He's getting a quality education.

232
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,173
I don't give a damn about his education.

233
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:40,487
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I want hazard pay.

234
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:42,047
I want another 30 grand.

235
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:43,181
Calm down, man.

236
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:46,271
And don't try to tell me
you don't have it. You hear me?

237
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,955
Now get the hell out of my house.

238
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:03,222
I thought I told you to go to bed.

239
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:32,392
She's not here.

240
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,204
I noticed.

241
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:36,071
What are you doing?

242
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,322
Looking for Juliet.

243
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,162
You're not gonna find her in there.
She left with Jack.

244
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,740
Juliet left with Jack?

245
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,192
He took off right after
I told him about Naomi.

246
00:15:45,349 --> 00:15:46,455
Who's Naomi?

247
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,531
And why would you do that, Kate?

248
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,021
Because she's hurt,
because he's a doctor

249
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:52,963
and because he has a right to know.

250
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,580
Where is he now?

251
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:55,754
I don't know, Sayid.

252
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,615
Of course you don't.

253
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:00,607
It might be time for you to tell
everybody else about Naomi, too.

254
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:01,769
Play her the tape.

255
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,633
What tape?

256
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,437
There's something you should know,
before we go.

257
00:16:15,705 --> 00:16:17,846
Whether or not you think
he's the Wizard of Oz,

258
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,424
I can assure you
that Jacob is very, very real.

259
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:27,887
And we're gonna go see him,
and he's not gonna like it.

260
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,262
In fact, I have a feeling
he's gonna be very... angry.

261
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:37,253
And that's why my hand was shaking,

262
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,626
because this is not a man
you go and see.

263
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,561
This is a man who summons you.

264
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,193
Well, I guess there's
a first time for everything.

265
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:29,567
It's us.

266
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:31,947
That's you, and that's me.

267
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:37,652
Now we never have to be away
from each other.

268
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,051
Happy birthday, Ben.

269
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,315
Thanks.

270
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,501
You're welcome.

271
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:36,625
It's your birthday.

272
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,379
Sorry I forgot.

273
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:49,162
It's kinda hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

274
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,989
She was just seven months pregnant.
We went for a hike,

275
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,707
but you had to come early.

276
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:00,764
Now she's gone...

277
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:06,655
And I'm stuck here on this island...
with you.

278
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:20,036
Happy birthday, Ben.

279
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,334
Mom?

280
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:54,634
Ben, don't!

281
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:00,429
Mom!

282
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,365
It's not time yet, Benjamin.

283
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:11,813
Mom!

284
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:52,699
Let's go, John.

285
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,438
So, what, the whole world
thinks we're dead?

286
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:08,615
- That's not important right now.
- Not important?

287
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:10,256
What do you mean, it's not important?

288
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,375
Excuse me.

289
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,852
I'm sorry. Don't you people
want to be rescued?

290
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:17,102
We kept her a secret to keep her safe.

291
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,325
Safe from what, Sayid?

292
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,707
Safe from Jack.

293
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,440
He spent a week with the others,

294
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,646
and he brought one of them
back with him,

295
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,048
here, amongst us,

296
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,259
and every time we try
to get answers from this woman,

297
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,054
he prevents her from giving them.

298
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:33,538
But it's Jack.

299
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,713
He would never do anything to hurt us.

300
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:38,476
And Juliet...

301
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:40,520
I believe she's a good person.

302
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,666
Good person, huh?

303
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,426
You're basing that on what?

304
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,853
Wouldn't involve her taking you

305
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:47,804
to one of their medical stations,
would it now, Mrs. Kwon?

306
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:52,174
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

307
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,976
<i>The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island</i>

308
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,758
<i>with her husband.
He was sterile before they got here.</i>

309
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,901
<i>I'm still working on getting samples
from the other women.</i>

310
00:22:00,976 --> 00:22:02,502
<i>I should have Austen's soon.</i>

311
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,533
<i>I'll report back when I know more.</i>

312
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:05,993
Where'd you get that?

313
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:09,558
Where have you been, Jack?

314
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:10,963
I asked you where you got it.

315
00:22:11,052 --> 00:22:13,472
You think you're in a position
to be asking us questions?

316
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,078
- Turn the tape over.
- Stay out of it.

317
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:16,827
You wanna burn me at a stake?
Here I am.

318
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,013
But first, turn the tape over.
Press "play."

319
00:22:30,368 --> 00:22:31,759
<i>Juliet, it's Ben.</i>

320
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,692
<i>I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon
the night after tomorrow.</i>

321
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:37,869
<i>We won't have time
to run Austen's sample,</i>

322
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:40,715
<i>so if you determine that she
or anyone else is pregnant,</i>

323
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:43,777
<i>mark their tents,
and we'll take them, too.</i>

324
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:46,555
Good luck.

325
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,404
The night I w your baby
on the ultrasound,

326
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:57,776
I told Jack
what they were making me do.

327
00:23:00,243 --> 00:23:01,520
Why didn't you tell us?

328
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:05,452
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

329
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:06,930
"Yet?"

330
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:16,581
I think we got some catching up to do.

331
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:33,477
Mom?

332
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:41,763
Mom?

333
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,427
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait. Are you lost? Wait.

334
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,412
Are you one of them?

335
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:22,676
One of who?

336
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:24,377
A hostile.

337
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,684
Do you even know what that word means?

338
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:31,741
What's your name?

339
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:37,432
So you wanna tell me what you're doing
in the jungle all by yourself?

340
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:41,731
I left home, and...

341
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:43,768
I'm looking for my mom.

342
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:45,502
You think she's out here?

343
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:47,758
You wouldn't believe me.

344
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:49,733
Try me.

345
00:25:52,435 --> 00:25:53,511
She's dead.

346
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,547
Did she die here...

347
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:01,928
On the island?

348
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:05,426
When I was a baby.

349
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,051
Did you see her...

350
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,228
Out here, Ben, in the jungle?

351
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:13,865
She talked to me.

352
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,177
What did she say?

353
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:20,032
That I couldn't come with her.

354
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,168
She said it wasn't time yet.

355
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:33,989
You should go home now.
Your people will be looking for you.

356
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:35,545
I don't wanna go back there!

357
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,415
I hate it there!

358
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,405
Take me with you.

359
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,300
Maybe that can happen...

360
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,380
Maybe,

361
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,923
if that's what you really want,
if that's what you want.

362
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:56,404
I want you to think about that...

363
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,580
And you're gonna have to be
very, very patient.

364
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:26,154
We're here.

365
00:27:40,027 --> 00:27:41,884
You'll want to turn off your flashlight.

366
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,028
Why?

367
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,206
Jacob feels the same way
about technology as you do.

368
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,512
Once I open this door,
there's no turning back.

369
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:35,055
Are you sure this is what you want?

370
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:44,656
So be it.

371
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:52,166
I'm here with John Locke.

372
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,576
We're coming in now.

373
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,464
Jacob...

374
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,839
this is John.

375
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:27,655
Aren't you going to say hello, John?

376
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:31,405
What?

377
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,058
I told you he wouldn't.

378
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:37,208
Who...
What are you talking about?

379
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:39,967
You can't see him?

380
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:42,718
See who?

381
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,569
He's sitting right here
in this chair.

382
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,265
Yes, I know, but he insisted.

383
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:53,991
What is this?

384
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,085
You wanted the secrets of the island?

385
00:29:57,217 --> 00:29:58,328
Well, here they are.

386
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:02,009
This is the man
who can answer every single...

387
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:04,532
I am not.

388
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,679
He made me bring him here.
Did you think that that was my...

389
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,109
Sorry, may I finish?

390
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:11,218
You're crazy.

391
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,718
Excuse me?

392
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:18,313
You don't know anything
about the island, do you?

393
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:20,454
You just made it all up.

394
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:21,865
Jacob, please, I can't hear him...

395
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,717
If you're gonna talk over
what he's saying...

396
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:24,718
Stop. Shut up!

397
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,869
You're putting on a show for me?

398
00:30:30,718 --> 00:30:31,718
Or do you...

399
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:36,105
Do you really think
there's someone there?

400
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,834
Iknow there's someone there.

401
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,488
You don't know anything.

402
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:56,572
I'm sorry you feel that way, John,

403
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:02,629
and I'm sorry that you're
too limited to see.

404
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,595
You're pathetic.

405
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,159
Help me.

406
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,191
What did you just say?

407
00:31:22,655 --> 00:31:24,962
I... I didn't say anything.

408
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,094
Oh, yes, you did.

409
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:28,596
I heard you.

410
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:30,585
You said that...

411
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:52,649
That's enough!
You've had your fun!

412
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:43,967
What was that?

413
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,717
That was Jacob.

414
00:32:58,138 --> 00:32:59,577
What did you hear in there, John?

415
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,945
What did Jacob say to you?

416
00:33:05,126 --> 00:33:06,862
He didn't say anything to me.

417
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:08,064
You did.

418
00:33:09,438 --> 00:33:12,082
- What are you talking about?
- There is no Jacob, Ben.

419
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:14,668
I'm not gonna be taken in
by the little...

420
00:33:15,181 --> 00:33:16,849
show you put on last night.

421
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:19,801
You're a fraud,
and it's time your people

422
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,110
were told the truth.

423
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,714
And this is not the way we came.

424
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:28,408
I'm taking us back another way.

425
00:33:28,638 --> 00:33:30,530
I wanted to show you something first.

426
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:32,249
I've seen enough.

427
00:33:33,998 --> 00:33:35,678
You know, John, you're not wrong.

428
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,459
Some of the things I've told you...

429
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,772
Some of the things
I've told everybody...

430
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,110
are simply not true.

431
00:33:41,877 --> 00:33:42,877
Like what?

432
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,565
Well, for starters,
I wasn't born on this island.

433
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:50,049
Then where did you come from?

434
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:54,783
That's what I want to show you.

435
00:34:46,187 --> 00:34:47,314
Morning.

436
00:34:47,527 --> 00:34:49,659
Okay, wait.
Put it right...

437
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:50,813
Right down there.

438
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:55,466
What's the problem now?

439
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:58,616
You're usually chatty cathy
in the morning.

440
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:00,323
It's my birthday.

441
00:35:04,494 --> 00:35:06,622
I don't know why I keep
fooling myself into thinking

442
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,579
that one of these years
you're actually gonna remember.

443
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,340
Well, I tell you what.

444
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:16,618
All we gotta do this morning

445
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,166
is run this stuff out to Pearl station.

446
00:35:20,748 --> 00:35:22,470
Why don't we go up to the Mesa,

447
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:24,000
drink some beers?

448
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Have some...

449
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,924
I don't know...
Father and son time?

450
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:36,937
I'd like that.

451
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,424
You sure can't say
it ain't beautiful.

452
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:14,216
Do you really blame me?

453
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:16,193
What?

454
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:20,420
Do you really think
it's my fault that she died?

455
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,315
What do I know?

456
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:33,770
Why do you keep looking
at your watch?

457
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:35,503
You got a date?

458
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Listen...

459
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,780
If it makes you feel any better,

460
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:47,008
I will do my best
to remember your birthday next year.

461
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:53,420
I don't think that's gonna happen, dad.

462
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,001
What do yomean?

463
00:36:57,818 --> 00:36:59,429
You know, I've missed her, too,

464
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,634
maybe as much as you have.

465
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:03,914
But the difference is

466
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,659
that for as long as I can remember,
I've had to put up with you.

467
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:15,948
And doing that required
a tremendous amount of patience.

468
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:24,754
Good-bye, dad.

469
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:51,207
You want us to, uh,
go get his body?

470
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:57,300
No, leave him out there.

471
00:40:20,948 --> 00:40:22,673
This is where I came from, John.

472
00:40:26,629 --> 00:40:27,851
These are my people...

473
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:30,913
the Dharma Initiative.

474
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,903
They came here seeking harmony...

475
00:40:39,162 --> 00:40:42,559
but they couldn't even coexist
with the island's original inhabitants.

476
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,143
And when it became clear
that one side had to go,

477
00:40:50,084 --> 00:40:51,850
one side had to be purged...

478
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,289
I did what I had to do.

479
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,412
I was one of the people
that was smart enough

480
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:02,878
to make sure that I didn't
end up in that ditch...

481
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,554
Which makes me considerably
smarter than you, John.

482
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,195
What did Jacob say to you?

483
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:25,319
Why did you do this?

484
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:27,473
Because you heard him.

485
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:31,967
Now I need to know what he said.

486
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:34,136
"Help me."

487
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,395
I'm not gonna ask you again.

488
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:40,966
What did he say to you?

489
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,491
He said...

490
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,303
