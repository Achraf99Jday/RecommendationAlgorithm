1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,553
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,993
I don't care what Jack said.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,992
They've got him and we have to
get him back. I owe him that.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,672
<i>The man, you said you'd seen him?</i>

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,671
<i>On a video feed from the Pearl Station.</i>

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,955
Why are we continuing
to play this game

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,077
when we all know it has
moved to the next stage?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,954
This is a map showing
electrical and data cabling

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,669
comprised of houses and dormitories.
Sounds like a place worth visiting.

10
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,069
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,913
When you heard Claire,
you drowned trying to save her.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,592
I dove in so you never went in!

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,037
I've tried, brother, to save you,
but no matter what I try to do,

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,758
you're going to die, Charlie.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,959
Mum?

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,710
Mum! Mum! Mum!

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,273
Oh, look, Aaron, your mom
has finally decided to wake up.

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,550
Only way I could get you to sleep in
was to borrow the midget.

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,790
And what is all this?

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,953
An aperitif of
Mysterious Island fruit

21
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,397
before the breakfast picnic
I have set up in your honour...

22
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,190
...a short walk down the beach.

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,794
- What's gotten into you, Charlie?
- Sorry?

24
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,678
It's just, you've been
so depressed all week, and...

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,797
...now it's breakfast in bed
and picnics?

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,154
I woke up and I thought,

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,516
it's time to stop feeling
sorry for yourself and seize the day.

28
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,310
I can't think of anyone I would rather
do some day-seizing with than you.

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,036
So, what do you say?

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,510
Let's drop the cherub off
with Auntie Sun and Uncle Jin

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,752
and you and I go for a little stroll.

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,353
I would love to.

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,753
From the position of this stream,
we should be here.

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,592
If the scale is right,

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,069
his people are two miles
in that direction.

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,911
I don't expect you to confirm that.

37
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,275
That's an electrical wiring map, Sayid.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,759
I'm not sure it's accurate.

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,389
Well, certainly not as infallible
as the magical carvings on your stick.

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,516
The stick did get us to that station.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,875
The station which you
accidentally blew up?

44
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,799
You're going the right way.

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,350
- Remind me why we're keeping him alive?
- What, we shoot him like a dog?

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,079
- No. I like dogs.
- He's right.

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,833
They will not trade
his life for your friend's.

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,629
- We should shoot him.
- Enough. Nobody's shooting anybody.

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,359
The map says where they are,
he says the map is right.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,192
So just keep moving.

51
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,311
OK. Here we are. Here we are.

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,360
- Not bad?
- Not bad at all.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,631
All right, if you'll take your seat,

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,757
we will begin with
our first course,

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,071
which is cereal. Then
we have a fresh fruit salad...

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,276
- Good morning.
... and...

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,791
Good morning, yourself.

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,994
- What brings you down the beach?
- Boar are thick.

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,949
I was hoping you might
wanna join me in a hunt.

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,077
Oh, well, thanks for the invite,

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,836
but as you can see,
we're just about to begin a picnic.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,480
Well, I think hunting might be a...

63
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,154
...a better way
to spend your day, Charlie.

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,708
Of all the things you could
choose to do today,

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,870
hunting with me
might be your best option.

66
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,554
Oh, my God.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,871
- What is it?
- I know how to get us off this island.

68
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,713
- Sun! Jin!
- Claire? What's the matter?

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,552
I need Jin's nets and fish.

70
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,790
Hurry, and buckets.
I need those too.

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,191
- We have to catch the birds.
- What birds?

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,795
They flew over, they'll only be
here today, so we need to catch it now.

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,030
Oh, this sounds like fun!

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,279
- Can you get some nets?
- Nets for what, Barb...

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,709
Nets for what, "Claire"?

76
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,190
OK, five minutes ago, a flock
of sea birds flew over my head.

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,711
Sea birds are migratory,
they're gonna keep heading south.

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,758
- I don't understand why we need to...
- They're tagged!

79
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,398
"Tagged?"

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,630
Scientists tag birds
so they can track them.

81
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,952
So when they eventually land in
Australia or New Zealand or wherever,

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,712
somebody's gonna gather them up.

83
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,920
- We can send a message.
- If we can catch one.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,194
OK, so here's the plan.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,875
First we cut up fish, make chum,
that will get the birds in the water.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,872
And then we're gonna need
to cut up some of this net.

87
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,951
Charlie, can you go
get some knives?

88
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,028
Charlie?

89
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,032
- Charlie!
- Yeah.

90
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,519
How do you even know
this stuff about birds, Claire?

91
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,909
I watched a lot of
nature shows with my mum.

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,275
Doesn't exactly make you an expert.

93
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,430
I don't want to see you
wasting your time, that's all.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,677
What happened to "seizing the day"?

95
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,876
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,916
I don't see the point.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,428
Hold still, dear,
just another second.

98
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,188
There. We're through now.

99
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,671
Ms. Littleton, I'm Officer Barnes.

100
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,513
Sorry to bother you, but
I need to ask you a few questions.

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,875
Can I ask you
how the accident happened?

102
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,636
A truck forced us off the road.

103
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,117
OK. And who was driving?

104
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,475
Me.

105
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,877
- Has anyone contacted your father?
- He died when I was two.

106
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,632
Sorry to hear that.

107
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,313
I spoke with the truck driver.
He's fine, by the way.

108
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,960
- He said that when you hit him...
- No, he hit us.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,072
About what speed
would you say that happened?

110
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,479
It came out of nowhere.

111
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,358
- I didn't...
- That's not the question I asked.

112
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,957
I don't know how fast I was driving.

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,629
Why are you even
asking me these questions?

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,190
These questions are standard procedure
when there's a fatality.

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,677
My mother is in surgery.

116
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,112
- She's not dead!
- Right.

117
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,317
- So she is.
- This is not my fault!

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,559
Didn't say it was.

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,073
G'day, Ms. Littleton.

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,910
Can I ask you something?

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,913
I told you that your daughter
was living with them...

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,869
...and you haven't asked me a single
question about her. You haven't...

123
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,235
Your friend, Jack...

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,917
...you care about him?

125
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,512
Yes.

126
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,594
Imagine 16 years from now,

127
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,355
you're told he was still alive,
but in your heart

128
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,831
you know that he wouldn't remember you,
he wouldn't know you.

129
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,315
He wouldn't even know
that you ever cared about him.

130
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,394
I haven't asked you questions
about my daughter...

131
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,879
...because I do not
want to know the answers.

132
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,478
- Water?
- No, thank you.

133
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,357
So how did you get here?
How'd you get onto this island?

134
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,955
Don't waste your breath.
Whatever he says will be a lie.

135
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,235
I was recruited when I was 24.

136
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,790
- I was approached...
- I didn't ask when. I asked how.

137
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,030
They brought me on the submarine.

138
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,793
So your people can come and go
whenever they want?

139
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,359
Go, yes.

140
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,831
But two weeks ago, our underwater beacon
stopped emitting its locator signal.

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,878
There was an event,
an electromagnetic pulse.

142
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,118
- Impossible to come back.
- Why would you want to come back?

143
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,519
You would not understand.

144
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,997
Try me.

145
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,798
I misspoke.

146
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,677
What I meant to say is,

147
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,433
- you are not capable of understanding.
- And why not?

148
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,274
- Kate...
- Because you are not on the list.

149
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,351
What list?

150
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,834
The man who brought me here,
who brought all of my people here,

151
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,673
he is a magnificent man.

152
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,191
If Ben's so magnificent, then why
did he need one of us to save him?

153
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,919
Ben? Ben is not...

154
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,955
I will try to make this
as simple as I can.

155
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,793
You are not on the list
because you are flawed.

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,319
Because you are angry.

157
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,277
And weak. And frightened.

158
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,070
The more I learn about you, the more
I suspect you are not as omniscient

159
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,718
as you'd have us believe.

160
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,510
Don't speak to us as if you know us.

161
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,434
Of course I don't know you,
Sayid Jarrah. How could I?

162
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,237
And you, Kate Austen,
are a complete stranger to me.

163
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,832
But you, John Locke,

164
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,751
you I might have a fleeting memory of.

165
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,912
But I must be confused because
the John Locke I know was para...

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,115
Hey!

167
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,838
Look at this.

168
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,388
Over here. Come on.

169
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,439
Well. Looks like we're here.

170
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,996
- Will this work?
- Yes. Work.

171
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,440
Sun... Please help.

172
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,111
OK.

173
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,674
- Smells great.
- Let's get it over with.

174
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,031
- This was my mother's worst fear.
- What do you mean?

175
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,238
That I would end up doing something
very much like this, cutting bait.

176
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,198
She had high hopes for my future.

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,748
They did not include
marrying a fisherman's son.

178
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,396
Well, I guess we don't always
turn out like our mothers want.

179
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,392
Of course, mine never
worked a day in her life.

180
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,675
My mom was a librarian.

181
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,039
"Was?"

182
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,872
We should get this stuff out there.

183
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,318
Where were you?

184
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,234
I went home to take a shower.

185
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,551
- That must've been nice.
- They said she was still in surgery.

186
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,316
I had glass in my hair, Aunt Lindsey.

187
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,439
Well, I'm glad that
you're feeling refreshed.

188
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,269
Good afternoon.
Are you the daughter?

189
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,278
I'm Dr. Woodruff from neurosurgery.
I'll be observing your mother.

190
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,998
How is she?

191
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,959
We've managed to stabilize
her immediate injuries, but...

192
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,838
...your mother's suffered
a severe head trauma.

193
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,911
We have to wait for
the swelling to go down

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,594
before we determine
the full extent of her injuries.

195
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,833
But... I'm afraid we're looking at
fairly widespread damage.

196
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,237
What does that mean?

197
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,233
It means that right now,
these machines are sustaining her life.

198
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,751
But, I mean, it won't always be...
When she wakes up, she won't need...

199
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,070
I can't say with any real confidence...

200
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,752
...that she will wake up.

201
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,599
- Can she hear us?
- I like to think she can.

202
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,838
How long will she be like this?

203
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,436
Could be a day, a week, or years.

204
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,353
We'll just have to wait and see.

205
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,396
But she'll be well looked after.

206
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,948
Oh, that's very nice,

207
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,554
- but we can't pay for that.
- Don't worry.

208
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,518
Her expenses have
already been taken care of.

209
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,192
By whom?

210
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,396
I've been asked to
keep that confidential.

211
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,917
One... two...

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,149
Oh, no!

213
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,438
Look, I'm sorry!

214
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,476
I'm sorry, man!

215
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,309
- What is wrong with you?
- I was shooting at a boar!

216
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,154
- I had no idea you were out here.
- Where's Charlie? Is he with you?

217
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,389
He's at camp. I'm sorry.

218
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,995
- So it was just you?
- Aye, it's just me.

219
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,629
Hunting in the exact same spot
as we're setting our trap?

220
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,591
I was following a boar, Claire.

221
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,399
Oh! So it's just coincidence, then.

222
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,272
Where is it?

223
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,556
It got away.

224
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,954
You don't want me to catch
the birds, do you?

225
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,918
You and Charlie.
What's going on?

226
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,313
Why wouldn't I want you
to catch the birds?

227
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,155
What is it?

228
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,757
Don't touch it!
Don't even go near it.

229
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,589
What are these pylons?

230
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,600
What do you think they are?

231
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,552
A security perimeter.

232
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,679
Those sensors on the side
would be triggered

233
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,069
if anyone passed between them.

234
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,033
It's an alarm system or a trap.

235
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,395
Either way, we will be safer
going around it.

236
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,836
You're right, it was
a security perimeter.

237
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,276
But like everything on this island,
it hasn't functioned in years.

238
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,873
Of course it hasn't.

239
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,916
If you wish to waste your time,
be my guest.

240
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,676
The pylons encircle the entire barracks.

241
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,750
There is no going around them.

242
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,070
If you don't believe me,
look at your map.

243
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,198
He appears to be telling the truth.

244
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,077
John! John!

245
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,115
Thank you.

246
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,157
Oh, my God.

247
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,753
Sorry.

248
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,156
He suffered a cerebral haemorrhage.

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,118
Why did you do that?
We needed him!

250
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,795
- They'd never trade him.
- You don't know that!

251
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,839
You don't know it either. What we know
was that he shot one of his own people

252
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,595
who didn't want to be in this situation.
I'm gonna stick with my opinion.

253
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,389
- We could've discussed it.
- Nobody asked me when we brought him.

254
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,435
All right.

255
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,035
Pardon me for not knowing
that they had

256
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,951
a "sonic weapon fence. "

257
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,952
I didn't know he was going to die.
How would I know that?

258
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,190
Why are you really here?

259
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,713
Are you here for Jack?

260
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,472
Why else would I be here?

261
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,119
We'll talk about this later.

262
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,909
Fine by me. Just tell me
how we're going go through this.

263
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,594
We're not going to go through it.
We're going over it.

264
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,796
- Sayid, where's the axe?
- In his pack.

265
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,351
No, wait a minute,
I got it. Here, I got it.

266
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,638
I thought you didn't know
there was any C-4.

267
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,872
Well, I stand corrected.

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,591
Why did you take it?

269
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,390
You never know when
a little C-4 might come in handy.

270
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,274
You'll have to do
better than that.

271
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,112
OK, there you go.

272
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,950
What's going on with you, Charlie?

273
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,156
- I just put Aaron down.
- No!

274
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,472
- You and Desmond, what's going on?
- What are you talking about?

275
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,712
You don't know anything about Desmond
shooting his gun and scaring the birds?

276
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,917
- I've been with Aaron all morning.
- You're lying, Charlie.

277
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,399
I am not lying.

278
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,109
What happened to the guy this morning,

279
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,475
who wanted to have a picnic
and "seize the day?"

280
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,835
You really want to know the truth?

281
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,597
That glint you saw could be anything,

282
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,231
a piece of glass stuck in the bird's
foot, or it could be nothing at all.

283
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,396
I don't want to advocate
false hope, Claire. That's all.

284
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,675
Well, I'm sorry I bothered you
with my stupid ideas.

285
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,079
It won't happen again.

286
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,628
And Charlie, I don't want
my baby around liars.

287
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,030
- I think you might be overreacting.
- Overreacting?

288
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,317
No, I thought you were here for me,
that I could count on you.

289
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,118
- I was wrong.
- No. Claire!

290
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,668
No, I'm on my own!
And at least I know that now.

291
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,471
- Claire!
- Just go!

292
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,351
Morning, dear.
Oh, I like your new doctor.

293
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,431
- What new doctor?
- Oh, the American.

294
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,592
He's in with your mum now.

295
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,038
Excuse me...

296
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,237
The nurse said...

297
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,955
Are you a doctor?

298
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,279
Yes.

299
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,595
I'm very sorry,

300
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,673
I shouldn't be disturbing you.
I was just leaving.

301
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,995
What are you doing here?

302
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,038
- I was just on my way out.
- If Carole knew you were here...

303
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,270
She'd what? What would she do?

304
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,750
- She wouldn't act the way you are.
- Aunt Lindsey...

305
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,231
...what's going on here,
who is he?

306
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,035
It doesn't matter. Just go.

307
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,317
Maybe you should tell her, Lindsey.
She deserves to know.

308
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,473
- Please, just leave us alone.
- You are not the arbiter here.

309
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,872
- Claire has every right to know...
- You're taking advantage of her!

310
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,359
Just stop it!

311
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,951
You are the one paying the bills?

312
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,508
Are you the one
taking care of all this?

313
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,198
Yes.

314
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,999
Then who are you?

315
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,758
I'm your father, Claire.

316
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,679
The system appears
to fire a sonic pulse

317
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,274
when an object breaks the plane
between two pylons.

318
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,796
So, as long as we
don't break the plane,

319
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,711
we should remain unharmed.

320
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,711
Why not use the explosive you took?

321
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,791
Be my guest.
You wanna go stick it on?

322
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,592
Whoever climbs over,
give those sensors a wide berth.

323
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,318
I'll go first.

324
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,389
Give me a hand.

325
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,117
I guess I'll go next.

326
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,749
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

327
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,077
- You have every right to be upset.
- It just doesn't make any sense.

328
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,312
Desmond's never gone boar hunting and
the boar never come close to the beach.

329
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,712
Well, whatever is going on,
they're still talking about it.

330
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,000
- Can you watch him?
- What are you going to do?

331
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,438
Get some answers.

332
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,159
I'll be with you in a sec.

333
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,993
There you go.

334
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,512
That'll be ten bucks.

335
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,071
What are you doing here?

336
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,071
Buy you a cup of coffee?

337
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,310
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Claire, I'm leaving tonight.

338
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,393
Then I'll be out of your life forever.
Just... one cup of coffee.

339
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,676
So, it's true?

340
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,393
Yes. It's true.

341
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,315
How did you find out
about the accident?

342
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,231
A doctor friend in Sydney told me.

343
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,710
I got the call... the minute
your mother went into surgery.

344
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,636
Why did she tell me
that you were dead?

345
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,797
Well, because I, no doubt, left her
with so many wonderful memories.

346
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,876
Look, we had a fling.

347
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,512
I was back in Los Angeles when
she told me that she was pregnant,

348
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,670
that she was going to have
the baby... you.

349
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,513
And you didn't...
you didn't want to see me?

350
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,798
No, I came out a bunch of times
when you were little.

351
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,111
I stayed over, gave you toys.

352
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,997
I... sang to you.

353
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,680
Why'd you stop coming?

354
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,198
Because your aunt hates me.

355
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,275
And your mother didn't like the fact
that I had another family.

356
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,830
Why are you here now, then?
Why did you come?

357
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,115
Could've paid her bills
from the States...

358
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,192
I came over because I wanted to help.

359
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,350
Help with what?

360
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,069
Claire... your mother is alive...

361
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,997
...but she's not really living.

362
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,870
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means

363
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,872
that now may be the time
to look at other alternatives,

364
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,155
other ways to relieve her pain.

365
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,279
Now, it is illegal
to turn off her machines,

366
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,158
but I know of ways that
can achieve the same effect

367
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,038
- without the legal consequences.
- Just stop it!

368
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,031
You didn't come here to help me.

369
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,749
- You came to fix a mistake you made.
- No, honey, that's not true...

370
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,549
You think just paying her bills
makes you noble or something?

371
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,030
You come down here
and you try and get me to kill her?

372
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,912
You know, just go.

373
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,753
Why don't you just go?
Go back to your "real" family.

374
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,918
You know...

375
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,198
...you might be my father...

376
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,910
...but I don't even know your name.

377
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,957
And I want it to stay that way.

378
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,590
Claire! Claire, listen to me!
Listen to me!

379
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,871
Do not keep your mother alive
for the wrong reasons.

380
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,076
Now, there is hope and there is guilt.

381
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,197
And believe me, I know the difference.

382
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,276
Good-bye, kiddo.

383
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,918
It was great seeing you again.

384
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,240
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,355
You followed me?

386
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,439
Stay back!

387
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,474
- It's one of the birds.
- Stay back!

388
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,390
How did you know
it was going to be here?

389
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,392
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

390
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,155
You had to. That's what you
and Charlie were arguing about.

391
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,954
You knew.

392
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,951
- How would I?
- I don't know.

393
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,951
You walked straight here,

394
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,315
no doubt at all
about where you were going.

395
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,790
You came right to this beach
and right to this rock.

396
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,510
And lo and behold, there's the bird!

397
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,268
What the hell is going on, Desmond?

398
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,352
See that spot over there?

399
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,514
That's where Charlie
slipped and fell in.

400
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,794
He got pounded again and again
by the rocks and...

401
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,388
...broke his neck.

402
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,192
What?

403
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,032
What are you talking about?

404
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,391
That's where Charlie died.

405
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,519
Look what Desmond found.

406
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,318
How about that?

407
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,997
It does have a tag.

408
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,513
You were right.

409
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,635
Desmond told me everything.

410
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,873
About all his visions...

411
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,036
...that he knew you were
going to get hit by lightning...

412
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,470
...that you were going to drown
trying to rescue me in the ocean.

413
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,750
How you died
trying to get me this bird.

414
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,995
You don't believe all that, do you?

415
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,795
Now, who turned the telly off?

416
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,031
Don't they know how much
you love your nature shows?

417
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,317
That's better.

418
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,350
So, how are you today, Mum?

419
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,791
Did you have an OK night?

420
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,593
There's...

421
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,915
...something I have to tell you.

422
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,871
Something I should've told you
a long time ago.

423
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,232
I'm pregnant.

424
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,953
I'm giving it away.

425
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,511
It's for... It's for the best.

426
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,958
I wish...

427
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,391
I don't know how you did it...

428
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,989
...raising me alone.

429
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,551
It must've been so hard.

430
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,312
And I was just... awful.

431
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,790
Awful.

432
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,876
So horrible to you.

433
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,111
I'm so sorry, Mum.

434
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,115
I'm so sorry.

435
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,192
I'm so sorry for all the awful things
I said to you in the car.

436
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,639
That...

437
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,670
...that I hated you.

438
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,275
And that... I wished
you weren't my mother,

439
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,557
and... I wished you were dead.

440
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,595
It's all my fault.

441
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,796
The accident...

442
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,711
...and everything.

443
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,920
I'm so sorry, Mum.

444
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,871
I'm so sorry.

445
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,516
I'm so sorry.

446
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,913
I'll see you soon, OK?

447
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,196
"To whom it may concern,

448
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,636
We are survivors of Oceanic Flight 815.

449
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,992
We have survived on this island
for 80 days.

450
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,672
Six hours into the flight,
the pilot said we were off course

451
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,228
and turned back towards Fiji.

452
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,514
We hit turbulence and crashed.

453
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,352
We've been waiting here
all this time,

454
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,352
waiting for rescue that has not come.

455
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,193
We do not know where we are,
we only know you have not found us.

456
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,954
We've done our best
to live on this island.

457
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,589
Some of us have come to accept
we may never leave it.

458
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,548
Not all of us have survived
since the crash.

459
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,029
But there is new life, too.

460
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,873
And with it, there is hope.

461
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,757
We are alive.

462
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,870
Please don't give up on us. "

463
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,153
It's...

464
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,034
It's perfect, Claire.

465
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,915
I'm not giving up
on you either, Charlie.

466
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,876
It's going to be OK.

467
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,030
You're going to be OK.

468
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,515
We'll get through this together.

469
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,478
What?

470
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,673
We're here.

471
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,238
Jack...
