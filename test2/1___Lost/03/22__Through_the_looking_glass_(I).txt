1
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:16,438
Would you put your seat back, please?

2
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:20,501
Would you fasten your seat belt, please?

3
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:22,703
Excuse me. Excuse me.

4
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,335
Can I get another one of those, please?

5
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,914
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

6
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,758
Well, 20 minutes is a long time.

7
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:32,593
How about a newspaper instead?

8
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:35,241
And if you could buckle
your seat belt, sir...

9
00:00:47,874 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>Sorry about the bumps, folks.</i>

10
00:00:49,185 --> 00:00:52,457
<i>We're just hitting a little warm air
as we make our descent into los angeles.</i>

11
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:54,193
<i>Please keep those seat belts fastened,</i>

12
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,163
<i>and we'll have you
on the ground shortly.</i>

13
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:19,698
It's me.

14
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,511
I, uh...

15
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,135
I just read...

16
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:39,886
Oh, forgive me.

17
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,635
Mom! Mom

18
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,886
Help!

19
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,964
You have everything you need?

20
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:27,451
No, but I made the best
out of what we have.

21
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,385
Bernard and Jin?

22
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,102
They're both excellent shots
and highly motivated.

23
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:39,178
The dynamite's in place.
We won't miss.

24
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,664
No matter what happens here,
I want you to keep moving.

25
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,496
Keep moving for that radio tower.

26
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,628
Don't turn back for any reason.

27
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,952
I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue,

28
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,077
but I'm not giving it up for nothing.

29
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,309
You understand?

30
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:04,309
I understand.

31
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,555
Then good luck.

32
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,182
You, too.

33
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,117
If I told you that I'd help you
with your "S.O.S." sign,

34
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,553
would you change your mind?

35
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,496
No, ma'am.

36
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,481
I want you to say it again.

37
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,147
Say it, Bernard.

38
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:33,683
I am a dentist.

39
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,184
I am not Rambo.

40
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,573
And don't you forget it.

41
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:55,983
Charlie's gonna be fine.

44
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,856
we have... to go... home.

45
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,642
All right.

46
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:47,855
Let's do it.

47
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:39,447
Subtitles: swsub.com

48
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:04,603
Can I ask you a question?

49
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,149
Sure.

50
00:08:06,255 --> 00:08:08,544
What did you do for a living
before you became Moses?

51
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:11,485
I was a doctor.

52
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,000
Right. 'course you were.

53
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:15,746
Well, I need your attention
for a minute, doctor.

54
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,798
Is she okay?

55
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,290
Why wouldn't she be?

56
00:08:23,548 --> 00:08:26,232
Because none of your people trusts her.
No offense.

57
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,995
Why don't you catch up to me
when you're done?

58
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:30,933
It's fine.

59
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,984
So I need to show you how
this wonderful gadget works

60
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,616
in case anything happens to me.

61
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,129
You need to be able to call my boat.

62
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,599
Okay. Show me.

63
00:08:43,796 --> 00:08:44,901
It's actually simple.

64
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,050
Turn her on here.

65
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,535
This opens a direct channel
to the freighter.

66
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,162
Give her a tap here.

67
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:52,243
Wait for the beep
and say hello.

68
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,681
- That's it?
- That's it.

69
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:58,623
Once the rock star turns off whatever
underwater contraption is jamming us up,

70
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,819
this red light will turn
a lovely shade of green.

71
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:04,064
That'll be any time now, yeah?

72
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,549
Hopefully.

73
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,708
Who are you?

74
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,538
If you tell us how you got down here,
we won't hurt you.

75
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:29,258
I came in my invisible submarine.

76
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,395
Don't you see it?

77
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:34,622
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy? He's one ofthem.

78
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:37,450
Why are you here, huh?

79
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,275
How did you find out
about this station?

80
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,139
Juliet told us.

81
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,264
She's one of us now...

82
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,627
In case you haven't heard.

83
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:54,982
We gotta call Ben.

84
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,670
Let's call Ben.

85
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,126
Come on.

86
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,185
<i>You're inside a room full of equipment.</i>

87
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:22,578
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

88
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,483
<i>You flick the switch.</i>

89
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:26,045
Light goes off.

90
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:29,608
And you drown.

91
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,083
<i>It's Boonie.</i>

92
00:10:45,677 --> 00:10:47,109
<i>Ben, are you there?</i>

93
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,317
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

94
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:54,321
Why are you breaking radio silence?

95
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:55,809
One of them's down here.

96
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,242
I'm sorry. What?

97
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,279
<i>We've got him tied up, but he's here.</i>

98
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,888
<i>One of them swam down here.</i>

99
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:02,222
Who?
Which one?

100
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,482
He won't tell us.

101
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:04,735
It's Charlie!

102
00:11:05,202 --> 00:11:06,247
<i>Tell him I said hi!</i>

103
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,046
How did...

104
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,191
<i>How does he know about the station.</i>

105
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:11,835
He said Juliet told them.

106
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,810
All right, sit tight. Don't do anything.
I'm sending help.

107
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,759
You need to go down
to the Looking Glass

108
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,949
and find out what Charlie Pace
is doing down there.

109
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:29,899
You told us the Looking Glass
was inoperable..

110
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,050
flooded.

111
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:33,046
I lied.

112
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,838
Mikhail, I need you to go now.

113
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:38,494
I can be there by dawn.

114
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,634
But if Juliet told them
about the Looking Glass,

115
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,219
what else did she tell them?

116
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:52,774
Ryan, come in.

117
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,626
Ryan, are you there?

118
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:07,544
Are your walkies all off?

119
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:08,706
Yes, sir.

120
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,051
Did you get a good look?

121
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:14,537
The tents are marked with white coral...
three of 'em.

122
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:15,899
Juliet did her job.

123
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:17,838
All right. Let's do this.

124
00:13:15,486 --> 00:13:16,566
It's empty!

125
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,577
Get away from the tent!

126
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,158
It's a trap! Move!

127
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:24,725
- Please, god.
- Get away from...

128
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:28,555
Move, move!

129
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:32,014
The tree line!

130
00:13:45,152 --> 00:13:46,291
I got your man!

131
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,055
Drop your weapons!

132
00:13:58,816 --> 00:13:59,868
I got your man!

133
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:02,991
It's over!

134
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,244
Don't.

135
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:07,763
Finger off the trigger.

136
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:21,775
There were supposed to be
three explosions.

137
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30,573
It didn't work.

138
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,992
There you go.
Good as new.

139
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:42,640
Thanks.

140
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,848
The news people
are waiting for you outside,

141
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:46,556
you being a hero and all.

142
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,493
Right.

143
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:51,773
The woman... how is she?

144
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,836
She's been stabilized.

145
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:56,117
Thank God you were on that bridge.

146
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,978
- Sorry.
- No visitors in E.R.

147
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,659
It's okay.

148
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:07,349
She's...

149
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:09,755
We used to be married.

150
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:12,411
Come on in.

151
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,410
What happened?

152
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:21,161
There was, uh...

153
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,099
a car accident.

154
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:27,411
Are you okay?

155
00:15:31,366 --> 00:15:32,469
Yeah, I'm fine.

156
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,595
Were you drinking again?

157
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:40,358
- Are you, Jack?
- No.

158
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,637
Why did you come down here, Sarah?

159
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:50,691
I'm still listed
as your emergency contact.

160
00:15:57,564 --> 00:16:00,614
What were you doing driving around
at 2:00 in the morning?

161
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,217
Maybe you could give me a lift home?

162
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,159
I don't think that would be appropriate.

163
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:34,847
Well...

164
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,613
Thanks for coming down, Sarah.

165
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:42,788
Good-bye, Jack.

166
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,471
Why were there only two explosions?

167
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:03,042
Maybe they didn't have
to blow the third tent.

168
00:17:03,078 --> 00:17:04,081
But those gunshots...

169
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,536
- What was that about?
- He's okay.

170
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:06,589
Do you believe that?

171
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:09,436
Listen, they had no idea
that we were waiting for them,

172
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:11,845
and Sayid's with your husbands.

173
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,731
They're gonna be fine, and they're gonna
be a couple hours behind us.

174
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:16,523
We should wait
for them here. You go on...

175
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,931
No. No one gets left behind.

176
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:21,535
If you say,
"live together, die alone" to me,

177
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:23,272
I'm gonna punch you in your face.

178
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,411
Fair enough, Rose.

179
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:28,351
Fair enough.

180
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:30,830
But we have a plan,

181
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,197
and for all we know, it worked.

182
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:37,742
It's gonna be okay.
Everything is gonna be all right.

183
00:17:39,586 --> 00:17:41,218
Let's just keep moving, okay?

184
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,404
It's okay. Let's go.

185
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:05,287
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.

186
00:18:06,508 --> 00:18:07,508
Why are you here?

187
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:13,889
I'm here...
to turn off your jamming equipment.

188
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,497
In there,
next to the flashing yellow light.

189
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:20,631
- Now how'd you know about that?
- I know because I know.

190
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:24,318
Whatever you ladies do to me,
I'm going to turn it off.

191
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,272
- You are, huh?
- Most definitely am.

192
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:27,382
So what's the code?

193
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:30,321
What?

194
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:33,142
If you're gonna turn off
the jamming equipment,

195
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,435
you're gonna need the code,

196
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:36,370
and only three people know it...

197
00:18:37,004 --> 00:18:38,871
Me, her and Ben.

198
00:18:45,445 --> 00:18:46,445
Well...

199
00:18:47,444 --> 00:18:48,820
Guess I won't need the code...

200
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,605
Since this entire station's
gonna be flooded anyway.

201
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,941
Now just turn off your little jammer,

202
00:18:57,086 --> 00:18:59,388
and the helicopters come
and rescue all my friends.

203
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:01,943
But if this station floods,

204
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,295
what happens to you?

205
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:08,946
I die.

206
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:17,042
What?

207
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>They're all dead--
Diane, Ivan. All of 'em--dead.</i>

208
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,232
<i>It's Shephard and his people--
they're gone!</i>

209
00:19:22,314 --> 00:19:23,519
Gone? Gone where?

210
00:19:23,648 --> 00:19:25,468
I don't know. Did you hear me?

211
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,010
They killed seven of us...

212
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:29,687
Calm down
and tell him the good news.

213
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,029
What good news?

214
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,220
We caught three of 'em...

215
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,395
The ones that stayed behind
to blow up the tents.

216
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:37,292
They knew we were coming.

217
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:38,652
It was Juliet.

218
00:19:39,403 --> 00:19:40,431
She betrayed us.

219
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:43,235
- What?
- Just figure out where she is,Tom.

220
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:45,464
Get up.

221
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:48,414
Okay, junior,
where the hell did...

222
00:19:52,903 --> 00:19:53,955
They're not talking.

223
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,114
Who do you have?

224
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,421
<i>Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.</i>

225
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:58,972
Shoot Kwon.

226
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:01,968
What?

227
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,782
You want them
to answer questions, kill Kwon.

228
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:04,856
<i>Do it now!</i>

229
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:09,159
I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure it's lovely.

230
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,081
No, wait, no...

231
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,477
- No talk.
- No, please.

232
00:20:12,736 --> 00:20:15,494
Talk to me. Nobody will get hurt.
Now tell me where your people went.

233
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,553
Bernard, he's lying.
He's going to kill us all.

234
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,777
Where are they?

235
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:29,612
The radio tower.

236
00:20:30,324 --> 00:20:31,753
They're hiking to a radio tower.

237
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,785
<i>Why in the hell are they going there?</i>

238
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,025
<i>A woman parachuted here.</i>

239
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,373
She has a satellite phone,
and they're gonna call her ship.

240
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,434
Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow,

241
00:20:47,173 --> 00:20:49,025
so why were they
waiting for us tonight?

242
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:50,235
You heard him.

243
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:51,796
How'd you know?

244
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,611
A kid...

245
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:58,444
<i>told us.
He came in a canoe and warned us.</i>

246
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,172
What kid?

247
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:02,907
Karl.
He said his name was Karl.

248
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,102
<i>You heard that, Ben?</i>

249
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,458
I heard.

250
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:19,379
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

251
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:20,518
Kill'em?

252
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:23,831
No.

253
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:25,521
Not yet.

254
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:35,843
We're going to the radio tower?

255
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:37,232
Not we, Richard.me.

256
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:40,398
You're going to take everyone
to the temple as planned.

257
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:43,455
Now might not be the best time
to go tromping off on your own.

258
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:44,745
Oh, really? And why not?

259
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:46,498
Because people are asking questions,

260
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:49,257
about leaving home,
about what happened to Locke,

261
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:50,418
about Jacob.

262
00:21:51,955 --> 00:21:53,834
Not to mention
the rapidly spreading rumor

263
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:56,029
that everyone who went
down to the beach is dead.

264
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,900
They're not all dead.

265
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:05,143
Where are you going?

266
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:07,440
Hello, Alex.

267
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:11,198
- I asked where you were going.
- Well, I thought I might go for a walk,

268
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,760
see if I can't find Jack
and all his friends.

269
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:16,409
I'm coming with you.

270
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:18,983
All right.

271
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:21,281
- What?
- I said all right.

272
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,440
In fact, I think it's a good idea.

273
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:27,658
I mean, you do wanna see Karl again,
don't you?

274
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,818
Get your pack.
I'm leaving in ten minutes.

275
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:38,380
There's 40 of them,

276
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:40,399
and you'relone.

277
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,171
They're gonna do whatever it takes
to get off the island.

278
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,659
What do you think is
gonna happen when you get there?

279
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:48,821
I'm gonna talk them out of it.

280
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,172
Something's wrong.

281
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:22,301
Lots of things are wrong.

282
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,820
Jin, bernard, Sayid...
They should've caught up to us by now.

283
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,775
I wanna go back to make sure
they're all right.

284
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:29,982
'course you do.

285
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:31,670
What's that supposed to mean?

286
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:34,575
It means, Kate, there's always
someone to go back for.

287
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,250
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

288
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:39,440
- Nothing.
- I'm fine.

289
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:41,621
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

290
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:50,481
- What'd you do that for?
- To wake you up.

291
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:54,670
Ever since you got that tape from Lock,
it's like you've been sleepwalking.

292
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,559
You don't care
about our friends, fine,

293
00:23:57,653 --> 00:24:00,271
but it's like you don't care
about anything anymore.

294
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,814
And since when did you
start calling me "Kate"?

295
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:10,221
You know...

296
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:14,292
They sent Juliet to check out Sun.

297
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:20,307
But she was there to check
and see if I'm pregnant, too.

298
00:24:24,503 --> 00:24:25,982
Well, let's hope you're not.

299
00:24:41,463 --> 00:24:42,613
That light still red?

300
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:11,767
Bloody hell.

301
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:12,861
You all right?

302
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:14,604
Not for long
if you don't get out of here.

303
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,661
You have to hide.

304
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:17,727
There's people in there.
Quick, hide, hide!

305
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,790
Hide, hide!

306
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:21,009
Who's he talking to?

307
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,468
Who were you talking to?

308
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:30,494
Wasn't talking to anyone.
I was just singing.

309
00:26:42,928 --> 00:26:43,928
Shut up.

310
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:45,899
Right, okay. You got it.

311
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,618
Come on.

312
00:27:25,457 --> 00:27:26,457
Can I help you?

313
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,343
Just checking her chart.

314
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,380
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill... Rob.

315
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,764
The new chief of surgery.
I don't think we've met yet.

316
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:35,955
Jack Shephard.

317
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:38,118
Dr. Shephard, the hero...

318
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,019
Twice over.

319
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:43,519
You all right?

320
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,179
After last night, I'm surprised
you'd even wanna come in.

321
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:49,585
Talk about right place, right time, huh?

322
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:51,545
This woman is very lucky you were there.

323
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,763
If she was lucky,
she wouldn't have a fractured back

324
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,681
that was impinging upon her spinal cord.

325
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:59,319
I'd like to...
operate first thing in the morning.

326
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:02,270
You wanna operate?

327
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:03,928
Yes.

328
00:28:04,018 --> 00:28:05,885
I'm sorry, but this isn't your patient,

329
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:07,666
and we are well aware of the issues.

330
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:10,083
Gary Nadler's doing
the surgery at 6:00 a.m.

331
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,736
With all due respect...

332
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,996
Dr. Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

333
00:28:22,824 --> 00:28:23,881
Last night,

334
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,645
you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son
out of a flaming car,

335
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:28,008
then you went back for her.

336
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:32,232
I think you've done enough.

337
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:33,599
I wanna do the surgery.

338
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:38,105
Look,
everything's under control here.

339
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:39,514
She'll be fine.

340
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,108
Go home. Have a drink.

341
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:43,803
You deserve it.

342
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,066
The chart, please.

343
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:00,412
You call me.

344
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,109
I wanna know what happens.

345
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:15,791
<i>... was shut down for several hours</i>

346
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:18,635
<i>in the wake of a fiery car accident
that left two injured.</i>

347
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:21,770
<i>An unidentified
40-year-old woman and her son.</i>

348
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,618
<i>Fortunately for the two of them,</i>

349
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:26,609
<i>Dr. Jack shephard was near
the scene of the crash</i>

350
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,674
<i>and pulled both victims
from the burning wreckage</i>

351
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,506
<i>and treated them at the scene
until paramedics arrived.</i>

352
00:29:31,876 --> 00:29:34,669
<i>The victims were later transported
to St. Sebastian hospital.</i>

353
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:37,706
<i>Further details of their conditions
have not yet been released.</i>

354
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:49,191
I'm going back.

355
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,731
- What?
- I'm going back to the beach.

356
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,725
No way.
We keep moving.

357
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:56,433
I ain't asking permission.

358
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:05,462
Look, you got a job to do here.

359
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,561
I ain't gonna stand in your way
of doing it,

360
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,092
but you sure as hell don't need me.

361
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,902
What do you think
you're gonna get done,

362
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,205
alone and unarmed?

363
00:30:13,624 --> 00:30:15,418
- He won't be alone. I'll go with him.
- No.

364
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,391
20 minutes ago, you weren't
even interested in going,

365
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:24,299
and now all of a sudden
you're telling Jack...

366
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:25,535
I didn't wanna go with you.

367
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,316
It's a suicide mission without guns.

368
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,178
I know where there are some guns.

369
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:36,262
There's a hidden cache
a couple of miles from here.

370
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:38,774
I can take us back to the beach
on a route past it.

371
00:30:39,724 --> 00:30:41,438
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

372
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:44,521
Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.

373
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:55,104
Let's do this.

374
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,234
Don't do anything stupid.

375
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,399
I won't if you won't.

376
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:15,978
Don't wait up.

377
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,853
I told you to shut up!

378
00:31:37,046 --> 00:31:39,043
You know how you get
a tune stuck in your head?

379
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:41,184
This song...
It just started coming to me.

380
00:31:41,395 --> 00:31:42,487
It's almost finished.

381
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:43,802
Just need to find the bridge.

382
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,555
Get the speargun.

383
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:47,460
- What? Why?
- 'Cause I want it to hurt.

384
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,921
- No, Ben said we...
- You don't wanna get it? I will.

385
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:55,463
No. I'll... I'll shut up!

386
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,188
I'll shut up!
I'll shut up.

387
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:07,582
I thought you two
were on assignment in Canada.

388
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,643
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

389
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,131
Hello again.

390
00:32:16,195 --> 00:32:17,405
Where is the other one?

391
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:18,720
What?

392
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,492
This idiot swam down from a boat.

393
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,716
I was just shooting at his friend.

394
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:24,804
He dove down here.

395
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:26,870
- He's alone.
- Are you sure about that?

396
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:30,798
Here's a better question
to ask, cyclops.

397
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:33,484
Why did your little friend Ben
tell you people

398
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:36,101
that this entire station
was flooded when it isn't?

399
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:40,040
Or, why these two have been
jamming transmissions off the island?

400
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,035
What?

401
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:44,068
Is that true?

402
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:47,350
- That's Ben.
- I'll get it.

403
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:57,290
You have to understand.
Everything I did, I did for the island.

404
00:32:57,695 --> 00:33:00,712
The island told you it was necessary
for you to jam your own people?

405
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:04,100
Yes, it did. You've always
been a loyalist, Mikhail.

406
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,790
Now I'm asking you to trust me,

407
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,152
<i>to trust Jacob.</i>

408
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:08,467
<i>The told me to do that.</i>

409
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:11,139
Why would Jacob ask you
to lie to your own people?

410
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:13,378
Because this island is under assault

411
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:15,860
by forces stronger than anything
it's had to deal with

412
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,793
in many, many years,
and we are meant to protect it,

413
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,044
by any means necessary.

414
00:33:21,484 --> 00:33:23,816
The jamming was for everyone's security.

415
00:33:24,908 --> 00:33:27,573
We are in a serious situation here.

416
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:31,169
So why not trustme?

417
00:33:32,437 --> 00:33:33,548
I made a mistake.

418
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,928
I should have told you,
and I apologize.

419
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,631
Mikhail, are you still there?

420
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:48,674
Yes.

421
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:52,872
I need you to help me.

422
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:58,023
I need you to help me clean up
this mess that I've made.

423
00:34:00,735 --> 00:34:02,279
I need you to kill Charlie.

424
00:34:08,562 --> 00:34:10,093
And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie

425
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,807
telling the others
about what we've done,

426
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,716
so you'll have to take care
of them, too.

427
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:21,482
How do I know you didn't say
the same thing to them about me?

428
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:24,456
Because if I had, Mikhail...

429
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:26,515
you'd already be dead.

430
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:43,129
Out of those polar bear cages
and put us on the chain gang,

431
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,586
what the hell did you have us
breaking all those rocks for, anyway?

432
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:48,080
We were building a runway.

433
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,182
A runway? For what?

434
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:52,273
The aliens.

435
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,745
I don't know what for.

436
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:57,648
Do you think they told me everything?

437
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:59,175
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

438
00:35:01,593 --> 00:35:03,026
So you screwing Jack yet?

439
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:04,682
No. Are you?

440
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,434
How far away are these guns?

441
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:10,805
There aren't any guns.

442
00:35:12,434 --> 00:35:13,462
What?

443
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:14,898
I lied.

444
00:35:14,964 --> 00:35:15,964
You lied.

445
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,192
It was the only way he'd let us go back.

446
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,078
So why are you going back?

447
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,151
Karma.

448
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,102
Why are you going back, James?

449
00:35:35,774 --> 00:35:36,849
Hey, guys! Wait up!

450
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:41,287
What the hell do you want?

451
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:42,784
I'm coming with you guys.

452
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,379
Unh-unh. No way.
Not a chance.

453
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:47,200
Come on. I can help.

454
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,491
They're my friends, too, man.

455
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,652
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him,

456
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,904
and Jack's too busy leading
to even talk to me.

457
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:58,704
I just wanna help. Please?

458
00:36:01,396 --> 00:36:03,093
For God sakes, Hugo, look at you!

459
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:05,168
you're just gonna get in the way.

460
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:08,287
You wanna get us killed?

461
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:13,753
Come on.

462
00:36:28,657 --> 00:36:29,948
If we head north,

463
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:33,304
we should get to 'em
before they reach the tower.

464
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,268
Why did you let me come?

465
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,132
I let you come because
I'm delivering you to your new family.

466
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:42,717
I let you come because you betrayed me.

467
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:45,654
You locked Karl in a cage.

468
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:48,396
You put him in a room
and tried to brainwash him.

469
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,187
I didn't want him to get you pregnant.

470
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:54,488
I suppose I overreacted.

471
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:58,067
We'd better get going.

472
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:01,436
Why do you have to stop them?

473
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,080
Why won't you just let them leave?

474
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,963
Because I can't, Alex.

475
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:51,943
Don't, John.

476
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:00,773
Put the gun down.

477
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,197
Walt?

478
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,443
Now get up, John.

479
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,625
He shot me, and I can't...

480
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:15,825
move my legs.

481
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:17,342
You can move your legs.

482
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:19,298
Now get out of the ditch.

483
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,194
Why?

484
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:24,800
Because you have work to do.
