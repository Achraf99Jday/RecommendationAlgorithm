1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,720
<i>Previously on Lost...</i>

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,700
This is not your island.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,418
This is our island.

4
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:10,312
<i>They've attacked us, sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.</i>

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:14,195
<i>We're not the only people
on this island, and we all know it!</i>

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,156
<i>They came the first night,
took three of us,</i>

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,833
<i>then they came back
and took nine more.</i>

8
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,537
<i>They're smart,
and they're animals.</i>

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,014
You're coming with us.

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,165
I burnt my hand...and my muffins.

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,865
Still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?

12
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,220
<i>It's a work in progress.</i>

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,289
It's not even literature. It's popcorn.

14
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,114
And why isn't it literature, Adam?

15
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,952
- I'm dying to know.
- There's no metaphor.

16
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,970
<i>It's by the numbers,
religious hokum-pokum.</i>

17
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,571
<i>- No metaphor?
- It's science fiction.</i>

18
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:57,028
<i>Now I know why Ben isn't here.</i>

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,164
Excuse me?

20
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,851
I know the host picks the book,
but seriously, Julie,

21
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:03,045
he wouldn't read this
in the damned bathroom.

22
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,810
Well, Adam,

23
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:08,576
I am the host, and i do pick the book,

24
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,217
and this, is my favorite book,

25
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,229
so I am absolutely thrilled
that you can't stand it.

26
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:17,834
Silly me for sinking so low

27
00:02:17,835 --> 00:02:20,586
as to select something
that Ben wouldn't like.

28
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:24,628
Here I am, thinking that free will
still actually exists on...

29
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:29,050
In the doorway, get in the door way.

30
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,700
Goodwin!

31
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:30,712
- You see where the tail landed?
- Yeah, probably in the water.

32
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,540
You run,
you can make that shore in 1 h.

33
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:34,490
Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,023
There may actually be survivors,

35
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:37,985
and you're one of them.

36
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,691
A passenger, you're in shock.

37
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,529
Come up with an adequate story
if they ask.

38
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:42,790
Stay quiet if they don't.

39
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,109
Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

40
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,870
I want lists in three days.

41
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,935
Go.

44
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:35,861
Final Sync : www.sub-way.fr
(V.0.90)

45
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:42,874
Kate!

46
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,012
Can you hear me?!

47
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,308
Rise and shine, Kate.

48
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,971
Where am I?

49
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,950
You don't really think
I'm going to answer that, do you?

50
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,114
Where are Sawyer and Jack?

51
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,934
I'll tell you what.

52
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,691
Why don't you just take
a nice hot shower?

53
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,234
Wake yourself up.

54
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,745
Wash the day off you and...

55
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,370
start fresh.

56
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,072
It's a nice clean towel,
shampoo, soap...

57
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,046
I'm not showering in front of you.

58
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,554
You're not my type.

59
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,370
Where are we?

60
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:38,909
Who the hell are you?

61
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,337
You ain't gonna talk to me?

62
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,860
What,
you got more important things to do?

63
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:24,544
<i>Warning.</i>

64
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,949
<i>Warning.</i>

65
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:37,924
I wouldn't do that.

66
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,013
I want your advice, I'll ask for it.

67
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,179
Son of a bitch!

68
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,590
Told you.

69
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:19,044
<i>Stop that.</i>

70
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,034
Hi, Jack.

71
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,564
I'm Juliet.

72
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,778
- Hi.
- Yes?

73
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:44,459
I'm Jack Shephard.

74
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,740
- I'm here for the...
- Where's your lawyer?

75
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,079
You look pretty.

76
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,159
Where's your lawyer?

77
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,053
I fired him.

78
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,526
Sarah...

79
00:11:14,563 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm sorry, for...

80
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:19,794
for pushing us to this place.

81
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,685
I know that I...

82
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:27,956
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

83
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:30,605
Yeah?

84
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:35,132
No, not yet. He just got here.

85
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,534
<i>I'll call you when I get out.</i>

86
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,929
Jack, I'm gonna say this

87
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:51,164
- as simply as I can.
- What's his name?

88
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,830
- Jack, stop it.
- I won't.

89
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:55,500
I'm gonna keep asking you that
until you tell me.

90
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,030
I don't ask you what you're doing...

91
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,654
Just tell me what his name is.

92
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,912
I wanna know,

93
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:02,230
who he is.

94
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,633
Look, you can have everything,
the cars, the house.

95
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,304
I don't care. I just...

96
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,916
I just wanna know,

97
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:12,613
the name of the man...

98
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,617
that is with my wife.

99
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,342
Jack?

100
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,504
Can you hear me in there?

101
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,590
Is that a "yes"?

102
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,166
Where are my friends?

103
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,973
Come down from the table first.

104
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,078
You want me to come down,
come in here and get me down.

105
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,956
- If you wanna talk, I'm happy...
- Tell me where my friends are!

106
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,990
I will...if you let go of the chain.

107
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,898
You think I'm stupid?!

108
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,200
I don't think you're stupid, Jack.

109
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,974
I think you're stubborn.

110
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,231
Where are my clothes?!

111
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:20,500
Come on, Kate.

112
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,962
He's waiting.

113
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,797
Sorry, I'm going to have to ask you
to put those on, Kate.

114
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,269
And if I don't?

115
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,880
Then you don't get any coffee.

116
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,798
A little tighter.

117
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,520
Please?

118
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,729
What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?

119
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,462
Now, why Sawyer?

120
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,926
Why Sawyer what?

121
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,011
He's the first one you asked about:

122
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:25,287
"what did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"

123
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,339
You don't know me.

124
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,896
Of course I don't.

125
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:35,089
I want my clothes back.

126
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,534
We burned them.

127
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,972
Why did you bring me here?

128
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,090
Why did you make me put on this dress?

129
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,811
Why are you feeding me breakfast?

130
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,669
I brought you here so you'd look out
at the water and feel comforted.

131
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,029
Comforted that your friends
were looking out at the same ocean.

132
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,969
I gave you the dress
so you'd feel like a lady,

133
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,027
and I wanted you to eat
your food with a real live fork

134
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:07,886
and feel civilized.

135
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,627
I did all those things so that

136
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,292
you'd have something nice to hold on to.

137
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,427
Because, Kate...

138
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,975
the next two weeks

139
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,555
are going to bevery unpleasant.

140
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,424
Yeah, hi.

141
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,961
I met a woman on the train, Sarah, and,

142
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,003
she dropped her cell phone,
and I don't even know her last name,

143
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,217
but your number was in her phone,
so I was just wondering...

144
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,890
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forget it.

145
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,182
Just give me a minute, dad.

146
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,690
I asked you to give me a minute here.

147
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,785
What's this?

148
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,833
Why are you dialing all the numbers
on Sarah's cell phone?

149
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,890
Because one of them is him.

150
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:07,043
You gotta stop this, Jack.

151
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,339
- It's over.
- Not until I know his name,

152
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,973
where he works, where he lives.

153
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,522
When they first kissed.
I wanna know what it is about him.

154
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,508
<i>Mrs. Owens, call the operator.</i>

155
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,229
<i>Mrs. Owens, call the operator, please.</i>

156
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,555
Why is Sarah calling you, dad?

157
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,768
I think it's time that you let this go.

158
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,985
- Why is she calling you?
- Because she was afraid...for you.

159
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:38,648
I wanna know exactly

160
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:41,509
- why the hell she would call you!
- She saw that you were slipping.

161
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:44,069
- You were losing your grip.
- My grip is not the problem.

162
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,780
Which is exactly what's happening here.

163
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,054
Jack! Come...

164
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,380
I think I know a little something
about being obsessive.

165
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:52,476
No, being a drunk

166
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,042
is not obsessive.

167
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,202
Let it go, jack.

168
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,495
What?!

169
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,898
If you're trying to talk to me,
I can't hear you!

170
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,803
<i>Let it go, Jack.</i>

171
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,190
I know you're hungry.

172
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,676
I brought this for you.

173
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
This is how it will work.

174
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,769
You sit there, across from the door,
back against the wall.

175
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:12,445
I open the door and leave the tray.

176
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,671
Can I trust you to do that, Jack?

177
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,447
I don't want your food.

178
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,220
It's a delicious sandwich...

179
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,300
I want you to tell the guy

180
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,052
who's talking to me
through that intercom

181
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:26,702
that he can give it up!

182
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,706
Maybe you're hungrier than you think.

183
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:31,799
That intercom hasn't worked in years.

184
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,261
What's that for?

185
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,092
The button-- what it's for?

186
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,357
It's for emergencies.

187
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,479
Who's watching me?

188
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,003
Are you going to sit against the wall
so I can open the door?

189
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,122
It's...just off the frying pan.

190
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,445
You can have it.

191
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,351
What do you do, Jack?

192
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,215
What's your profession?

193
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,987
I'm a repo man.

194
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,121
You know,
when people don't pay their bills,

195
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,202
I go in for the bank,

196
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,932
and I collect their possessions.

197
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:13,086
I'm a people person,
so I really love it.

198
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,835
Are you married?

199
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,697
I never saw the point.

200
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,437
What about you?

201
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:23,990
What's your job, besides

202
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:26,258
making sandwiches?

203
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:29,048
I didn't make it.
I just put the toothpicks in.

204
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,986
When your plane crashed,

205
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:38,775
where were you flying from?

206
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,032
Sydney.

207
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,499
What were you doing there?

208
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,258
I was bringing my father home.

209
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,001
Why would you go all the way
to australia just to...

210
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:58,312
...because he was dead.

211
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,722
I'm sorry.

212
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:07,593
I'm sure you are.

213
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,519
Thanks.

214
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:18,803
You can trust me, Jack.

215
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,231
I'm not gonna hurt you.

216
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,160
What the hell is going on here?

217
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:09,369
How long would it take
to get to your camp?

218
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,892
What, you're talking to me now, Chachi?

219
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:15,823
From where they got you,
how long a walk was it--

220
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,007
Day? Two days?

221
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,645
Hey, what are the people like--
from your plane?

222
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,364
Oh, they're just awesome.

223
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,959
Last one of you boys came for a visit
got tortured by our iraqi.

224
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,808
He tortured me, too.

225
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,372
Well, hell, he don't know any better.

226
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:38,343
<i>Subject escape.</i>

227
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,025
<i>Subject escape.</i>

228
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,533
How'd you get out of there?

229
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,990
<i>Subject escape.</i>

230
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,490
You run that way.

231
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:50,215
- Hold on...
- You run that way!

232
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,700
<i>Subject escape.</i>

233
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,448
Say it!

234
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,047
Say it, Karl.

235
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:48,773
I'm...sorry.

236
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,629
Sorry I involved you
in my breakout attempt.

237
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,805
The drugs we gave you
when we brought you here

238
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:26,907
have a fairly serious side effect--
dehydration.

239
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,670
Your head is probably sore.

240
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:30,009
Your throat is raw,

241
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,494
and if you don't eat
or drink something soon,

242
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,516
you're going to start hallucinating.

243
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,322
So you're a doctor, huh?

244
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,262
No.

245
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,374
I'm a repo woman.

246
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,128
No strings attached.

247
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
You don't have to answer any questions.

248
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,517
You don't have to do anything

249
00:25:54,575 --> 00:25:57,310
but sit with your back
up against the far wall.

250
00:25:57,464 --> 00:26:00,486
Let me open that door,
put the plate down and leave.

251
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:05,598
I know it feels like you're giving up,

252
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:09,513
like you're losing if you do
anything that I ask you to.

253
00:26:10,084 --> 00:26:11,345
But you're not.

254
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,466
You need to eat.

255
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,554
What do you say?

256
00:26:55,587 --> 00:26:56,849
Thank you, Jack.

257
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:08,331
Let's take out the epidural catheter
and get him startedon a P. C. A.

258
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,643
<i>Excuse me just a second.</i>

259
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:15,015
You sure he's ready
to self-administer his pain meds?

260
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,430
Hello?

261
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,786
<i>Dr. Shephard?</i>

262
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,207
- Jack?
- Give me your cell phone.

263
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,558
- What?
- I wanna see it. Now.

264
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,256
Look where you are, Jack.

265
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,421
Just look around you, please.

266
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,862
- Okay?
- Give me the phone!

267
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:27,166
This is not the place for this.

268
00:28:27,258 --> 00:28:28,490
You must be Jack.

269
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,137
Why don't you, grab a chair and join us?

270
00:28:38,531 --> 00:28:39,533
You...

271
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,110
You know me?

272
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:42,323
Yes.

273
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,260
Your father's told us all about you.

274
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:46,140
Yeah? What's he told you about me?

275
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,861
What'd you tell 'em about me, dad--

276
00:28:47,957 --> 00:28:50,173
that your--
your son never really had it?

277
00:28:50,632 --> 00:28:52,019
Not like the old man.

278
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,349
I didn't have the will
to make it work-- my--

279
00:28:55,907 --> 00:28:58,455
my life, my job, my marriage?

280
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:00,900
What'd you tell 'em
about my marriage, dad?!

281
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,275
You know how he manages his marriage?

282
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:08,553
A bottle of scotch
every night before dinner.

283
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:11,514
Your father has been sober 50 days now.

284
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,362
We're very proud of that.

285
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,617
Dad!

286
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,307
I wonder what--
what helped you turn that corner?

287
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:25,558
You think maybe it was--

288
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,404
a new lady friend?
You think maybe that's what it was--

289
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:30,288
- I will not let you talk to me--
- I will not

290
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:32,296
sleep with my wife

291
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:38,350
Jack, I'm your father.

292
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:40,747
Jack, please, just let it go!

293
00:30:06,243 --> 00:30:07,335
Which way out?

294
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:08,650
Don't do this, Jack.

295
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,424
Don't. Don't.

296
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,803
- Open the door.
- No, I can't Jack. I do that, we die.

297
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,400
- You're lying to me.
- I'm not.

298
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,957
- Open the door!
- I swear I can't!

299
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:32,553
<i>She's telling the truth, Jack.</i>

300
00:30:37,277 --> 00:30:38,490
I swear to god...

301
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,482
I will kill her.

302
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:42,946
Okay.

303
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,782
Have her open the door,
and she dies anyway.

304
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,109
We all do.

305
00:31:28,092 --> 00:31:29,286
Over here!

306
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:50,738
The button!

307
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,325
- What?!
- The yellow button! The button!

308
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,038
<i>Warning.</i>

309
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,247
Gotcha, doc!

310
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,103
<i>Reward!</i>

311
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,333
<i>Reward!</i>

312
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,090
Oh, come on.

313
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,799
Unbelievable.

314
00:33:31,323 --> 00:33:32,498
<i>Keep movin'.</i>

315
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,270
Stick your hands out through the bars.
I'll take off your cuffs.

316
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:59,597
They scratched you up
pretty bad, didn't they?

317
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,772
I'll bring you some antiseptic later.

318
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,047
How about you bring mean an ottoman?

319
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,938
While you're at it,
I could use a blow-dry.

320
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:10,849
You got yourself a fish biscuit.

321
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,685
How'd you do that?

322
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:15,447
I figured out
your complicated gizmos, that's how.

323
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,565
Only took the bears two hours.

324
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,536
How many of 'em were there?

325
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,735
You okay, freckles?

326
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,701
Yeah.

327
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,842
You?

328
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,730
Just swell.

329
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,973
I requested that cage, but whatever.

330
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:50,605
Nice dress.

331
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,141
They made me wear it.

332
00:35:03,696 --> 00:35:04,871
Are you hungry?

333
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,375
It's an aquarium.

334
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,196
Excuse me?

335
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,020
This thing's for what...

336
00:36:02,446 --> 00:36:03,729
sharks?

337
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,952
Dolphins, too.

338
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,102
We're underwater, aren't we?

339
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,771
Yes.

340
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,930
Is this one of their...

341
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,923
stations-- the--
the Dharma Initiative?

342
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,076
They called it the Hydra.

343
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:30,500
So you people are just...

344
00:36:33,046 --> 00:36:34,607
whatever's leftover of them?

345
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:38,834
Well, that was a long time ago.

346
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:44,074
It doesn't matter...

347
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:47,150
who we were.

348
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,444
It only matters who we are.

349
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:55,735
We know exactly who you are,
Jack Shephard.

350
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,904
You don't know anything about me.

351
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,292
We know that you're a spinal surgeon

352
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,472
based out of St. Sebastian's hospital
in Los Angeles.

353
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,397
I know that you went to Columbia,

354
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:10,089
and you graduated med school
a year faster than anyone else.

355
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,471
I know that you were married,

356
00:37:12,895 --> 00:37:14,224
only once,

357
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,319
and that you contested the divorce.

358
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,929
I know your father died in Sydney.

359
00:37:22,104 --> 00:37:23,558
I know this because

360
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:26,744
I have a copy of his autopsy report.

361
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:31,360
How...

362
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,035
- How did you get--
- we got it.

363
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,546
What is that?

364
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,652
This, Jack...

365
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:47,465
is your life.

366
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,193
Do you...

367
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,335
is it just about me,
or is it about my family, too? My...

368
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,190
My friends?

369
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,909
It's pretty much about everything.

370
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,388
Do you know about my...

371
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,159
About my ex-wife?

372
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,964
Sarah.

373
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,065
Yes, Jack.

374
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,170
We know all about her.

375
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,766
What would you like to find out?

376
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,299
Shephard, someone posted your bail.

377
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,182
How'd you...

378
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:52,002
Your dad told me you were here.

379
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,990
I called you a cab.

380
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,225
So...

381
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,148
good-bye.

382
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,564
Sarah!

383
00:39:20,938 --> 00:39:21,979
What?

384
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,733
Is that him?

385
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:26,829
- What difference does it make?
- It just does.

386
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,315
- It's not gonna change anything.
- Look, I wanna know!

387
00:39:31,274 --> 00:39:32,507
I need to know who he is.

388
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:33,790
It doesn't matter who he is.

389
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,607
It just matters who you're not.

390
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,213
Your father...

391
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,699
when he called me...to help you...

392
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,197
he was so drunk,
I could hardly understand him.

393
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,860
Look at the bright side.

394
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:09,944
Now you have something to fix.

395
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,418
What would you like to find out?

396
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,671
Is she...

397
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,955
Is she happy?

398
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,190
Yes, Jack.

399
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,767
She's very happy.

400
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,842
Now I'd like to bring you
some food and water,

401
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:08,928
but this time I need to know
that you'll behave.

402
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,951
Can I trust you, Jack?

403
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:22,794
Put your back against the wall, please.

404
00:41:57,006 --> 00:41:58,393
Good work, Juliet.

405
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,078
Thank you, Ben.
