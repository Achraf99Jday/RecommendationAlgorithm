00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,910
Previously on LOST

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:02,980
Is that a helicopter?

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,040
Is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,890
Get away from her!

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,070
Desmond.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,040
What's wrong?

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,410
- What's wrong is I'm married.
- Right.

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,370
I'm afraid... the new is not good.

9
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,820
The chances of conceiving are...

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,130
impossible.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,800
you're pregnant.

12
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,190
Hey.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,610
Good morning,jack.

14
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,740
You need a hand?

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,580
Thank you.

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,760
I came by your tent earlier.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,280
Is jin gone?

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,100
Oh.

19
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,220
He went off with charlie,hurley and desmond.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
Did you need him?

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,490
Actually,I was looking for you.

22
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,180
I wanted to see how you were doing with your pregnancy.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,210
Oh.

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,030
I'm doing fine.

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,420
- A little tired,but that's normal,right?
- Sure.

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,510
- Any morning sickness?
- Not anymore.

27
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,080
Any bleeding?

28
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,890
Why are you asking me all these questions,jack?

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm just checking in.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,550
I mean,now that I'm back,I just...

31
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,040
wanted to make sure that you were doing okay.

32
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,710
Thank you.

33
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,760
I'm okay.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Great.

35
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,620
Hello

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,590
Mrs.Kwon?

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,730
Jin

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,570
I'm still not used to "Mrs.Kwon."

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,030
Well get used to it.you're a married woman now.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,400
Guess what? I found amazing linens for the apartment.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,100
If you like them,I love them.

44
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,670
Lots of boxes.

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,980
But I got the bed set up.

46
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,490
Why doesn't that surprise me?

47
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,220
I have to get back to the office.

48
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,740
See you tonight.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
Mr.Kwon?

50
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,680
Yes,Mrs.Kwon?

51
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,960
I love you madly.

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,270
I love you too.

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,780
Is this you?

54
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,720
Yes,it is.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,410
Congratulations.

56
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,350
He's very handsome.

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,900
I'm a lucky girl.

58
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,570
Very lucky.

59
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,770
Your father is Mr.Paik? Of Paik Automotive?

60
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,190
Very powerful family.

61
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,370
I don't really have much to do with the family business.

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,570
What about your husband's parents?

63
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,470
His parents are dead.

64
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,030
Really...?

65
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,530
Who are you?

66
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,730
It would bring much shame if it was known...

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,380
...that Mr.Paik's daughter...

68
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,680
...married the son of a fisherman.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,690
I know that and it doesn't matter.

70
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,550
Really?

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,920
Did you know he was also the son of a prostitute?

72
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,290
How dare you!

73
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,100
I will be back here in three days.

74
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,130
At five P.M.

75
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,720
You will bring me one hundred thousand dollars.

76
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,950
If you love your husband as "madly" as you say...

77
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,500
...you will spare him the shame of learning the truth.

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,860
- who is she?
- I have no idea.

79
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,240
She seems to know you,dude.
She just said your name.

80
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,020
I've never seen her before in my life.

81
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,500
she's waking up.

82
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,910
she's trying to talk.
We should get her some water.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,700
- Hey,give me a hand.
- Yeah.

84
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,060
- me estoy muriendo.
- What's she saying?

85
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,730
I don't know.

86
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,780
Spanish,dude.

87
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,400
What,do you understand her,then?

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,120
Estoy muriendo.

89
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,180
Me estoy muriendo.

90
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,610
- She says she's dying.
- Me estoy muriendo.

91
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,600
Estoy...

92
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,080
- oh,my god!
- Oh,it's a branch!

93
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
She must have hit it on the way down.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,140
Uh,get her pack.
We haven't got much in this first aid kit.

95
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,850
- See if there's anything we can use in there.
- What if this is a rescue?

96
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,550
What if she came for us?
W--

97
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,120
I mean,is she gonna be okay?
We can't let her--

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,110
well,just go and start looking!

99
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,930
we go.
Jack.

100
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,250
jack--
we have to get her to jack as soon as possible.

101
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,470
- She could be our way off the island.
- No,if we move her,it'll make it worse.

102
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,250
Oh,we just let her bleed to death?

103
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,080
No,we--
we need to bring jack here.

104
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,100
It's an 8-hour walk one way!

105
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,120
Then I'll run.

106
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,530
You're out of your mind.
It's not safe.

107
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,690
It's gonna be dark soon.
Who knows who's out in this jungle? In case you have forgotten,

108
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,540
there are people on this island trying to kill us.

109
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,450
Nobody knows we're here!

110
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,880
oops.

Surprise!

115
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,410
I got your favorite--tofu soup.

116
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,180
Thank you.Let me finish this box.

117
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,120
We'll unpack later.Let's eat.

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,350
Do you mind if I put this on the table?

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,870
Not at all.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,250
Even in a cap and gown...

121
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,450
...you're the sexiest woman I've ever seen.

122
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,100
Don't you have and pictures of your family?

123
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,290
We didn't have a ...

124
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,740
...camera growing up.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,210
No pictures at all?

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,750
Well...

127
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,730
...didn't your father leave you any?

128
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,770
No, I was in the army when he died.

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,120
The army? You said your father died when you were sixteen.

130
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,270
No.I was in the army.

131
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,630
But you told me --

132
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,330
You must've misunderstood.

133
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,240
What is this about,Sun?

134
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,690
It's...

135
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,000
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,640
Your soup is getting cold.

137
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,060
how's this?

138
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,280
That's perfect.

139
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,900
Thank you.

140
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,920
What do you think happened to jack while he was with the others?

141
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,480
Since he's been back,he seems different.

142
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,330
He says that he was pretty much a prisoner,and

143
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,230
the only reason why he cooperated is 'cause he thought they'd let him off the island.

144
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,400
Do you believe him?

145
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,200
Why wouldn't I?

146
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,000
He came to me,asking about my pregnancy.

147
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,470
Well,what would that have anything to do--

148
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,800
what if...

149
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,960
what if the others want my baby?

150
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,000
He's beethere alone for over a week.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,860
How do we know he isn't working with them?

152
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,760
He's not working with them.

153
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,300
Do you know something,kate?

154
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,060
It's juliet.

155
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,130
She was their doctor--
their--

156
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,510
their fertility doctor,studyi pregnant women,and

157
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,320
when claire was sick,she told me and jack...

158
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,820
the reason the others wanted her baby...

159
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,440
was for research.

160
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,870
Sun!

161
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,040
- Wait.You don't have to do this.
- Go away,kate.

162
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,550
I want to know about your research.

163
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,380
Sun...

164
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,650
what happens to pregnant women?

165
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,620
You're pregnant.

166
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,290
Are you sure?
How do you know?

167
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,390
I asked you a question.

168
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,420
Everyone else might be all right with you washing your clothes and eating our food,

169
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,490
but I want to know what's going on.

170
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,980
I want answers.

171
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,340
What are you people doing?
Why are you taking children?

172
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,430
What happens to pregnant women on this island?

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,980
- What happens--
- they die.

174
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,280
They all die.

175
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,990
sun,come on.
Let's go.

176
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,630
what is she saying?

177
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,930
Chinese...
not korean.

178
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,830
Maybe we should just pull it out.

179
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,210
- Noyou'll just make it worse.
- Have you forgotten what's at stake here?

180
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,760
Or is this just another one of your flashes?
Who's getting an arrow in the neck this time?

181
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,740
Lest you forget,she said my bloody name!

182
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,170
She had a photo of me and my girlfriend.

183
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,990
Do I understand?
I understand better than the lot of you!

184
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,090
Hey,guys,chill.

185
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,340
We've wasted enough time already.

186
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,520
Hey,you're not leaving us.

187
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,250
- Just get out of my way,charlie.
- No!

188
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,500
Jin!

189
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,170
- Jin!
- Jin!

190
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760
who are you?

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,310
I said,who are you?

192
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,380
He's the guy who shot sayid.

193
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,500
Kate told us.
He lived out in that station that locke blew up.

194
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,610
He's an other.

195
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,380
I thought locke killed that guy with the electro-fence thingy.

196
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,430
You've got five seconds to talk,or I fire this gun,brother.

197
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,190
- That's a flare gun.
- And how do you think it'll feel...

198
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,550
taking a flare to the chest at this range?

199
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,280
As your friend pointed out,I already died once this week.

200
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,150
Aiutame.
Sto...

201
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,560
sto morendo.

202
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,630
You understand her.

203
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,330
She's speaking italian.

204
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,720
She said she's dying.
She needs help.

205
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,960
I was a soviet army field medic.
I can offer you my services.

206
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,880
- Wait.What are you doing?
- I'm saving her.

207
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,880
This branch has punctured her lung.

208
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,690
It's filling with blood.

209
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,650
If it is not ventilated soon,she's going to die.

210
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,230
Well,do it.
Help her.

211
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,590
If I fix her,you must let me walk away as if I never came upon you.

212
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,790
What do you need?

213
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,590
Excuse me. Are you Mr.Kwon?

214
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,350
Yes.

215
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,130
You must be Sun.

216
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,320
Thank you.

217
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,060
Please.Tell me about your wedding.

218
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,810
It was beautiful.

219
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,830
The happiest day of my life.

220
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,300
And my son's,too,I imagine.

221
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,280
Mr.Kwon.

222
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,370
Why weren't you at the wedding?

223
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,100
What did he tell you?

224
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,240
He told me...

225
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,690
You were dead.

226
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,490
Why would he say that?

227
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,040
To avoid the shame of where he came from.

228
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,250
And is that why you told him...

229
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,820
...his mother died when he was a baby?

230
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,410
His mother...

231
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,210
She was with many men.

232
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,170
She left me with the baby.

233
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,970
I raised him alone.

234
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,170
I wasn't even sure I was the father.

235
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,890
But who else would take care of him?

236
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,980
You are so beautiful.

237
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,290
It pleases me so much to meet you.

238
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,530
You can never tell him that you met me...

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,370
...or that this mother is still alive.

240
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,360
Please...

241
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,300
...for me.

242
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,900
Do not...

243
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,480
Do not make him suffer this shame.

244
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,140
be quiet.

245
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,070
Don't move.

246
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,470
You want me to help you and your baby?

247
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,370
I have answers to your questions,but you ha to come with me right now.

248
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,160
Just you and me,nobody else.

249
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,970
if what you said was true,that means I'm already dead.

250
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,020
Why should I go anywhere with you?

251
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,660
Because there may be hope for you yet.

252
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,740
Where are we going?

253
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,230
There's a medical station near here.
They have an ultrasound machine.

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,420
Claire and kate told me about that place.

255
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,060
It was abandoned.
They found nothing there.

256
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,740
Well,that's because they didn't know where to look.

257
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,410
What are you going to do to me?

258
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,150
I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the D.O.C.--

259
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,500
Um,date of conception.

260
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,010
The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant,give or take a day.

261
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,560
If you got pregnant off the island,then you and your baby will probably be okay,

262
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,430
but if you got pregnant here...

263
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,220
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

264
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,070
When was the last time you and your husband had sex?

265
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,920
I would rather not talk about that.

266
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,310
Look,I know that it's personal,but if I know when,then I can figure--

267
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,440
isn't that what the machine will do?

268
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,470
Yeah.

269
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,970
Then let's keep walking.

270
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,170
Mr.Paik.

271
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,650
Your daughter is here to see you.

272
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,100
Congratulations on your wedding.

273
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,320
Thank you.

274
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,910
We wish you much happiness.

275
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,010
To what do I owe this visit?

276
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,560
I need to ask you a favor.

277
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,000
What is it,my dear?

278
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,860
I... I need...

279
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,730
One hundred thousand dollars.

280
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,750
What for?

281
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,080
I can't tell you.

282
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,270
Why should I give you money without an explanation?

283
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,250
Because my whole life...

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,310
...I've pretended not to know what you do.

285
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,460
I've allowed you to keep your control over me.

286
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,130
I pretend that everything is all right.

287
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,450
I will continue pretending.

288
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,250
As long as you give me the money I am asking for.

289
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,230
No questions asked.

290
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,110
We do not live in a world where there are no questions asked!

291
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,500
I'm doing this to spare someone I love deep shame.

292
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,330
Your new husband?

293
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,250
If the money is for your husband...

294
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,520
It is he who will bear this debt.

295
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,140
He will no longer be a floor manager.

296
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,830
He will be working for me.

297
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,900
what else do you know about this woman?

298
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
Did she have anything on her besides the flare gun?

299
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,980
Just a book,a fancy radio/phone thingy...

300
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,160
does it work?

301
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,050
Like I'd tell you.

302
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,450
One of you must help.

303
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,040
The rest,clear the way.I need space.

304
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,650
I'll do it.

305
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,340
Wipe away as much of the blood as you can.

306
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,000
need to evacuate the air now!

307
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,450
Hold her steady.

308
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:24,940
Steady!

309
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,370
Yeah,I-I heard you.

310
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,850
is that... normal?

311
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,770
gauze.

312
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,780
Tape it. Be careful.

313
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,610
The covering needs to be hollow.

314
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,040
The wound needs to breathe.

315
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,190
what did she say?

316
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,200
"Thank you."

317
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,800
She said,"thank you for helping me."

318
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,640
It's right down here.

319
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,180
why are you doing this?

320
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,210
What?

321
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,750
Helping me.

322
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,480
Once upon a time,

323
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,640
I told women that they were pregnant,

324
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,030
and their faces...

325
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:49,060
it was the best news they ever got in their entire life.

326
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,100
Then I came here.

327
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:01,210
I've lost...nine patients...

328
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,480
in the last three years.

329
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,460
I'm helping you because I want to tell you

330
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,750
that you and your husband got pregnant before you came here.

331
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm helping you because I want to give good news again.

332
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,850
I slept with another man...

333
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,390
Before we got to the island.

334
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,210
Jin and I,we were having...

335
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,410
trouble.We weren'T...

336
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,460
and I had a friend.

337
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,480
It was a mistake.

338
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,550
We all make mistakes.

339
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,630
Which way?

340
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,780
will you help me move this forward?

341
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,900
good.

342
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,820
why is this room hidden?

343
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,670
Don't worry about it.

344
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,680
What is this place?

345
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,180
Tell me.

346
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,590
It's where we brought the women to die.

347
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,950
She's fine.

348
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,690
Keep the wound as clean as you can.

349
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,420
She should be better in a day.

350
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
A day?

351
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,090
Her lung was punctured.

352
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,750
On this island,the rules are a bit different.

353
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,290
Maybe a day and a half.

354
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,830
I did as I promised.

355
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,740
She will live.

356
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,090
- You can't seriously be considering letting him go. - Just go.

357
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,220
Are you kidding?He's one of them!

358
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,510
So what would you have me do,charlie?

359
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,380
We've t to make a stretcher and carry her.

360
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,870
How are we gonna do that and bring a prisoner?

361
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,570
- Give me some rope. - I'll take responsibility.

362
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,770
Phone. Phone!

363
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,760
- Wait,jin! - Phone!

364
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,550
- Jin,it's all right! -  no,let him!

365
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,320
- Jin,come back here! - Oi,let him!

366
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,190
- jin,it's all right! Jin! - Phone!

367
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,530
Jin,let him go.

368
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,790
Jin,let him go!

369
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,840
Phone!

370
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,580
You stole this?

371
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,120
How could you respect me if I didn't try?

372
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,750
How about I take your other eye?

373
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,670
Would you respect that?

374
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,350
Sorry. I--

375
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,200
charlie,don't!

376
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,970
Charlie!

377
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,220
Charlie,let him go!

378
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,360
This is a mistake!

379
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,830
We can't keep letting these people go!

380
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,430
We gave him our word!

381
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,620
Go on.

382
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,890
Get out of here.

383
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,310
the baby isn't jin'S.

384
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,360
We tried to have a baby back in korea and couldn'T.

385
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,520
And the doctor...

386
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,010
he told me jin was infertile.

387
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,520
And then you came here.

388
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,480
What?

389
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,800
Did you know that the average male sperm count is between

390
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,650
60 and 80 million?

391
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,630
But on this island,it's five times that.

392
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,180
We call that good odds.

393
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,710
you ready?

394
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,480
Yes.

395
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,040
Okay,you wanna lift up your shirt a little?

396
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,930
It's cold.

397
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,490
will I see the baby?

398
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,520
Maybe.

399
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:39,610
It's your first trimester,so it's a little iffy.

400
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,050
If you don't see a heartbeat,

401
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,010
don't worry about it.It's just early.

402
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,490
How does it work?

403
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,920
Well,I take a measurement

404
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,860
of the fetus,and that will tell us

405
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,650
when your baby was conceived,

406
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,430
and then we'll know who.

407
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,030
are you okay?

408
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,510
I lose either way.

409
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,810
If I'm going to live...

410
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,150
that means the baby's not jin'S.

411
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,190
Do you still want to do this?

412
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,540
- Yes.
- Okay.

413
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,860
Moment of truth.

414
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,010
Mrs.Kwon

415
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,170
Mr.Kwon

416
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,400
I heard you came by the office today.

417
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,930
Why didn't you come say hello?]

418
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,280
I didn't want to bother you.

419
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,170
Seeing you is never a bother.(¼ûÄã²»»áÊÇÎÒµÄÂé·³µÄ ÖªµÀÂð?)

420
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,310
Next time,i promise.(ÏÂÒ»´Î ÎÒÒ»♪¨»áÀ´)

421
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,240
Did you get the mail?

422
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,210
Sorry,i forgot.

423
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,890
Do you have the mail key?

424
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,050
It's in my purse.

425
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,700
Jin!Wait!

426
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,240
What's this money?

427
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,390
It's...from my father.

428
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,360
Why?

429
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,900
I wanted to get us furniture....

430
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,520
And I wanted us to have a nice honeymoon.

431
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,780
I can provide for you.

432
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,760
The honeymoon..the furniture.I know it will take longer...

433
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,370
but it will happen.And i will pay for it.

434
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,190
I will always take care of you,Sun.

435
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,830
I know.

436
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,090
Then give it back.

437
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:26,740
I don't want to be in your father's debt any more than we already are.

438
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,660
Please.

439
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,140
Jin...

440
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,830
I love you.

441
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:46,610
- Madly?(ÕæµÄÂð?)
- Madly?(ÕæµÄ)

442
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,980
there it is.

443
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:18,770
There's your baby.Can you see?

444
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,570
I can see it.

445
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,350
is it a boy or a girl?

446
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,050
Oh,it's--it's a little early,

447
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:35,880
but,um,do you see that little flutter?

448
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,040
that's the heart beating.

449
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,370
it's very strong.It's very healthy.

450
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,670
Okay.

451
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,870
you crashed here 90 days ago.

452
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:02,070
The baby was conceived about eight weeks ago,

453
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:05,820
so... around 53 days.

454
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,250
you got pregnant on the island.

455
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,120
I am sorry.I'm so sorry,sun.

456
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,540
I will do everything that I can.

457
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,690
it's jin'S.

458
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,790
I was starting to think you wouldn't come.

459
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,190
Why didn't you tell me you were Jin's mother?

460
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,880
I gave birth to him.But hat doest not make me his mother.

461
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,550
You know how powerful my family is.

462
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,980
My husband believes that you are dead.

463
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,620
Do not force me to make that reality.

464
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,100
so how long do I have?

465
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,900
Most of the women made it into the middle of their second trimester.

466
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,150
Nobody made it to their third.

467
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,770
That gives me two months.

468
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,110
I am...very happy the baby's jin'S.

469
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:43,430
You gave me good news,juliet.

470
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:47,060
It was my pleasure,sun.

471
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,540
I'm gonna go back inside and make sure that I didn't miss anything.

472
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,820
I don't wanna take the chance that we didn't cover our tracks.

473
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,640
Do you wanna wait out here?

474
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,450
All right.

475
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,750
Juliet?

476
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,160
Thank you.

477
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,890
ben,it's 6:00 A.M.On saturday morning.

478
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,710
Kwon is pregnant.

479
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,720
The fetus is healthy and was conceived on island with her husband.

480
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,120
He was sterile before they got here.

481
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,410
I'm still working on getting samples from the other women.

482
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,540
I should have austen's soon.

483
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,500
I'll report back when I know more.

484
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,790
I hate you.

485
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:27,100
- You can't trust 'em,you know.
- What's that?

486
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:30,390
The others--the one you let go.

487
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:32,950
He'll be back tomorrow with five of his mates.

488
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,290
Should've killed him.

489
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,330
Charlie.Uh,tight.

490
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,160
Oh,okay.

491
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,020
You know,brother,

492
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,410
by my count,

493
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,820
you've killed more of them than they've killed of you.

494
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,360
They started it.

495
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,910
You know,just 'cause one comes traipsing back

496
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,480
with jack and kate doesn't mean that we can trust them now.

497
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,010
Mom?

498
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,790
