1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,793
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,421
You brought me here to operate on you. You think I trust you,

3
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:08,258
that I'm gonna just do the surgery, and hope that you let me go?

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,678
Jack... you have to do it.

5
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,431
How did they get you to ask me? What did they offer you?

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,350
Then what are you doing here?

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,477
They're gonna kill Sawyer.

8
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,193
Tomorrow morning, first thing,

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,904
we'll get it out, and they'll keep you alive.

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:32,190
I'm ready.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,079
No! No! Sawyer, please!

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,410
You get your hands off of him!

13
00:00:40,664 --> 00:00:43,218
I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sac.

14
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:47,251
Now if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead.

15
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,211
Now get in here, and bring that walkie-talkie.

16
00:01:37,186 --> 00:01:37,931
Hello.

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,563
I fell asleep.

18
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,233
With candles burning-- that's real safe.

19
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,282
We don't have to keep doing this, you know.

20
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,903
Are you saying that because you don't think it's gonna work

21
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,871
or because you're afraid he'll find out?

22
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,160
Lift up your shirt.

23
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,722
Okay.

24
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,853
Some doctor you are.

25
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:13,522
I'm not doing this as your doctor. I'm doing it as your sister.

26
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:19,740
I don't like youbeing here alone. Come stay with me.

27
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:22,781
I like living on the beach.

28
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,490
This is Miami, Rachel.

29
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:28,661
Everything's on the beach.

30
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,802
Kate, you have about an hour head start before they come after you.

31
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,920
Take the walkie, take Sawyer and go.

32
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,340
Wait. Where are you? Where are you?

33
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:43,803
- Kate, listen to me. Just listen to me.
- You remember what I told you on the beach?

34
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:47,060
Do you rememberwhat story I told you when you were stitching me up?

35
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:49,272
Do you remember it?!

36
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:51,441
Yes, yes, I remember!

37
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:56,522
When you get safe, you radio me and you tell me that story.

38
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,523
Jack, please--

39
00:03:57,576 --> 00:04:01,650
if I don't get a call from you in the next hour, I'm gonna know something went wrong, and he dies!

40
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,360
- I can't leave without you.
- Yes, you are. Go.

41
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,490
- Jack, I can't!
- Go, now.

44
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:20,132
She's not a surgeon. She can't fix this.

45
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,182
He's right.

46
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:33,890
Let's go.

47
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,360
Sawyer, let's go!

48
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,283
Sawyer!

49
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:55,211
Then what the hell do you suggest we do?

50
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:00,962
Go get Danny, then find Austen and Ford

51
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,593
and bring them back.

52
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,550
No, you do that, and Ben dies.

53
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,393
Go.

54
00:05:06,437 --> 00:05:08,762
You think I'm lying? Do you think this is a bluff?

55
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,312
- I will let him die!
- No, Jack, you won't.

56
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,523
Go. Get them back.

57
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,110
If you have to...

58
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,821
kill them.

59
00:05:58,235 --> 00:05:59,063
Hello?

60
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,812
- Dr. Burke?
- Yes.

61
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:04,401
This is Diana from Mittelos Bioscience. I'm calling to confirm your appointment tomorrow.

62
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:05,652
- Uh, 2:00, right?
- 2:00.

63
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:09,452
Dr. Alpert asked me to tell you that he's very much looking forward to meeting you.

64
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:10,992
- Me, too. Thank you.
- Good-bye.

65
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:11,952
Stay here.

66
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,472
Hello, Juliet.

67
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,181
Hey.

68
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:16,771
Hey, Ed.

69
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:22,230
Uh, why exactly are you here?

70
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,071
Oh, I'm... today's lab work...

71
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:28,692
I  got home, and I realized that I inverted some numbers.

72
00:07:28,745 --> 00:07:30,822
And it couldn't wait till the morning?

73
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,820
Um... Edmund?

74
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,622
I'm sorry. How rude of me.

75
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,500
Uh, Juliet, this is Sherry. Sherry, this is Juliet,

76
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:43,001
my ex-wife.

77
00:07:46,505 --> 00:07:48,090
Juliet's leaving.

78
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,180
I am.

79
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,263
Jules...

80
00:07:57,148 --> 00:08:00,602
Could you please turn off the lights?

81
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,743
You haven't thought this through, Jack. Your plan's not gonna work.

82
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,032
Yeah? Why is that?

83
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,580
Your friends aren't going to make it back to your side of the island because we're not on that island.

84
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,963
We're on a smaller island 2 miles offshore.

85
00:08:27,928 --> 00:08:29,091
'Fraid so.

86
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:38,563
So why don't we see if we can come up with some kind of peaceful resolution?

87
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,442
- A peaceful resolution?
- That's right.

88
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:47,311
Is that what you call asking me to kill Ben while on the operang table--

89
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,151
- Make it look like an accident?
- That's ridiculous.

90
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,030
- She wants Ben to die.
- Tom, he's lying.

91
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:53,740
She said if I did it... that she would protect me--

92
00:08:53,747 --> 00:08:54,660
Enough!

93
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,121
Juliet,

94
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,252
get out.

95
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,293
Tom, he's lying.

96
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:07,383
You said you can't stitch him up... then you don't need to be in here.

97
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,291
Go, Julie.

98
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,300
Don't let him fool you.

99
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,640
He'll never let a patient just die.

100
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:27,101
Hey!

101
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,900
Hey, can anybody hear me?!

102
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:33,691
What happened?

103
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,321
- Open the cage.
- Where is--

104
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:37,321
Just open the damn cage!

105
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,051
That's our island?

106
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,143
What, you didn't believe me when I told you before?

107
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,140
We need a boat.

108
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,641
Yeah, a couple of towels and a buffet lunch.

109
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:04,853
We'll just keep following the beach.

110
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:08,023
There's gotta be one around here somewhere. How else do they get back and forth?

111
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,442
Why don't we just stop and ask for directions?

112
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,781
Jack, are you there?

113
00:10:15,826 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

114
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,950
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

115
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,873
Tell him I said "hi." Get to the point!

116
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:24,623
Jack, we need a boat. We need some way to get off of this island.

117
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:26,502
You heard her.

118
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,751
How do they get off this island?!

119
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:32,340
What's he doing?

120
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:34,803
Kate?

121
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,383
Go, go!

122
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:40,303
Kate!

123
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,680
Come on!

124
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,532
Go! Go, go!

125
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,602
This way!

126
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,400
Jason, you all right?

127
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:39,190
Get inside, get inside! Go!

128
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:50,792
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

129
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,631
Come on, come on. Come on! 

130
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,842
Quiet.

131
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,433
Shh, shh!

132
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:07,641
What?

133
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,520
Where'd they go?

134
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,272
That way.

135
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:24,410
Nice to meet you, Sheena.

136
00:12:26,835 --> 00:12:28,333
Is it true?

137
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,911
Is what true?

138
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,372
What you said--

139
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:34,830
did  julietreally ask you to kill him?

140
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,341
Yeah...

141
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,301
and in about 40 minutes, she's gonna get her wish.

142
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:41,223
Hey...

143
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:52,640
that's... not... helping... anything.

144
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,449
Now...

145
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,360
could somebody please get Juliet?

146
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,048
Juliet?

147
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:14,710
Edmund wants to see you in his office.

148
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,580
Do you work here?

149
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,752
I'm the new research assistant.

150
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:23,842
Of course you are.

151
00:13:39,698 --> 00:13:40,771
I want in.

152
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:43,821
In on what?

153
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,112
I know what you're doing, Juliet.

154
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,913
I'm not really sure what--

155
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,332
I read your notes.

156
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:56,040
I know what you took from the lab. The only thing I don't know is...

157
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:58,883
who's your guinea pig?

158
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:06,260
Ed, I've...I've been doing my research in my own lab,

159
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:08,843
on my own time. I don't really see--

160
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
It's your sister, isn't it?

161
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:16,440
Look, Jules, there's two ways this plays out--

162
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:22,903
one is, your research is potentially genius.

163
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:25,901
And the other,

164
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:30,410
you're raising some very serious ethical questions,

165
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,243
maybe even criminal concerns...

166
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,503
But if you collaborate with me,

167
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:41,251
based on my repution,

168
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:46,223
l this is viewed as cutting edge science.

169
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:51,550
And we will win prizes and drink champagne

170
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:55,140
and do a lot of good for people.

171
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:07,153
Why don't I give you some time to think about it?

172
00:15:24,218 --> 00:15:25,212
Juliet.

173
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,513
Ben's awake.

174
00:15:31,437 --> 00:15:32,393
How?

175
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:36,683
Shephard says he's a spinal surgeon, not an anesthesiologist.

176
00:15:38,935 --> 00:15:40,771
Ben's asking for you.

177
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,740
This a hobby of yours, underdog, digging holes?

178
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,661
Yep, that and basket weaving. Want one?

179
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,331
Happen to have a tunnel to the mainland?

180
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,963
No, but I've got a boat.

181
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:05,710
Can we use it?

182
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,631
Yeah, but we've got to hurry.

183
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,053
Hold on a second, sister. You just happen to find us in the woods,

184
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,091
you just happen to have a boat, and you're gonna let us use it, huh?

185
00:16:15,437 --> 00:16:17,140
There's something we need to do first.

186
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,223
Oh, gee...

187
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,480
My boyfriend is being held prisoner.

188
00:16:20,776 --> 00:16:24,560
If you help me rescue him, I promise you, I'll get you back to the other island.

189
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,692
Your boyfriend--

190
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,283
his name happen to be Karl?

191
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:32,610
Yeah. 

192
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,531
Come on.

193
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:41,791
I stopped the surgery.

194
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,873
I know.

195
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,132
I've been able to hear youfor a few minutes now.

196
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,133
It's very clever of you.

197
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,682
I should have seen it coming.

198
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,433
Are you in pain? I can...

199
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,262
No.

200
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:01,893
But  thanks all the same.

201
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,911
I'd like to speak to Juliet alone, please, Jack.

202
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,701
No. No, I'm sorry.

203
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:23,042
Please, I'm asking you...

204
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,920
one gentleman to another.

205
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:31,673
It won't hurt youto give me three minutes, will it...

206
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,592
knowing I have only 27 left?

207
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:52,483
- If you touch him, if you try to--
- I won't.

208
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,662
You've got three minutes.

209
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,890
I'm Tom, by the way.

210
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,870
They've got history.

211
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:10,401
I would like for you to go back in there, put ben under and finish the surgery.

212
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,901
And why would I want to do that?

213
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,491
Because I'm going to gohelp your friends escape.

214
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:31,501
Thanks for taking the time to let us make our pitch, Dr. Burke.

215
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:36,090
Mittelos Bioscience is based in Oregon. We're just outside of Portland.

216
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:44,180
Uh... these shots might seem a little, uh, cheeseball, but our people really are this happy.

217
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,560
Now why? Because we're privately funded.

218
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:49,271
Privately funded means freedom.

219
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:55,402
We organize trips every week in and around the Portland area,

220
00:19:55,445 --> 00:20:00,322
which is just awesome for hiking and biking and river running.

221
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:06,452
Look, when you-- your company-- reached out to me, I was flattered,

222
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,793
but I don't really know why you would want me to--

223
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:13,713
Is it true that you successfully impregnated a male field mouse?

224
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,883
He didn't carry to term.

225
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,422
Mind if I ask you something?

226
00:20:20,475 --> 00:20:21,383
Sure.

227
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,560
What do you see?

228
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:32,852
Well... it's a human womb, obviously.

229
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:35,273
Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium,

230
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,820
I would say that the woman was somewhere in her 70s.

231
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:39,940
No, actually, she's 26.

232
00:20:40,996 --> 00:20:42,153
What happened to her?

233
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,033
What if I told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out?

234
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,081
We think you're special, Dr. Burke,

235
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,000
and we want you to lead a team of highly trained people

236
00:20:53,046 --> 00:20:55,253
because we think you're just that good.

237
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:57,380
I can't.

238
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,883
Why can't you?

239
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,972
My ex-husband wouldn't let me. I--

240
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:05,720
- He wouldn't want you to have this opportunity?
- No, he doesn't want me to have anything.

241
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:09,430
- He would never give the okay.
- Maybe we could reach out to him on your behalf--

242
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,351
- Don't bother.
- There must be something that he would respond to.

243
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,651
If he were hit by a bus-- how about that? That would work.

244
00:21:19,275 --> 00:21:20,531
That was totally inappropriate.

245
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:22,860
- No, no, no--
- No, I, uh...

246
00:21:24,537 --> 00:21:26,820
I'm sorry that I wasted your time.

247
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:30,292
- Dr. Burke, please, you--
- No, I'm sorry.

248
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,662
Whatever you think I am, I'm not.

249
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:37,253
I'm not a lead, Mr. Alpert.

250
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:38,883
I'm a mess.

251
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,921
Well, hell.

252
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:37,770
Karl's  gotta be in there.

253
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,021
What, you mean you ain't sure?

254
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:42,482
It's the only place I haven't looked.

255
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,111
You know the guard?

256
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:46,822
Yeah. His name's Aldo.

257
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:48,073
Aldo?

258
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:54,831
Okay, lollipop, you wanna tell me how we're gonna get by him with one gun and no bullets?

259
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,290
I've got an idea.

260
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,502
Of course you do.

261
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,841
Open the door!

262
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:04,340
Alex? What the hell are you doing?

263
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:07,261
They must've gotten out of their cages. I caught them in the jungle.

264
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:09,683
- Now open up, Aldo!
- Whoa, whoa-- just stop.

265
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,551
Alex, you're not supposed to be here. If your dad finds out, he's gonna kill me.

266
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:16,101
My dad was the one who told me to bring them here, to you.

267
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:21,020
Look, maybe you should call him. I'm sure he's got nothing better to do.

268
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,361
Danny, I need ben.

269
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,951
Why?!

270
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:35,870
Listen, I got Alex here. She's got Austen and Ford with her--

271
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,580
Damn it, whatever she says, don't believe it.

272
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,752
You hold 'em right there. I'm on my--

273
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,801
Don't get mad at me just 'cause

274
00:23:44,846 --> 00:23:48,223
you were dumb enough to fall for the old "wookiee prisoner" gag.

275
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:49,343
Where's Karl?

276
00:23:49,388 --> 00:23:51,091
I have no idea what you're talking about.

277
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:52,892
Shoot him in the knee.

278
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,180
What?

279
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:57,602
Give me the rifle. We don't have time for this. I'll do it.

280
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:01,901
Whoa, whoa! Okay, all right! He's at the endof the hall, room 23.

281
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:03,441
Keys are in my back pocket.

282
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,872
Damn good con, Freckles. I almost believed you were gonna shoot that boy.

283
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,662
It wasn't a con.

284
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:15,953
Here it is!

285
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,001
Give it to me.

289
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:24,810
Help!

290
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:26,560
Help!

291
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:50,383
Is he okay?

292
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:52,972
Look, we got your boyfriend back. Now where's your damn boat?

293
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:00,142
Idiot! Where are they?

294
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,392
I don't know. Alex was with them.

295
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:03,392
Danny!

296
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,100
We're letting them go.

297
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:09,152
- Letting them go?
- Ben gave the order.

298
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:11,020
- Ben's in surgery. I was just there.
- He woke up.

299
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,192
Oh, he woke up, huh?

300
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:15,781
Shephard won't finish the surgery unless he knows his friends are off the island.

301
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:17,611
Do you want Ben to die?

302
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,453
I know Ben would rather die than let them go.

303
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,220
Hey.

304
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,601
How was the interview?

305
00:26:41,186 --> 00:26:42,892
It's not for me.

306
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,103
- What?
- It's fine.

307
00:26:45,357 --> 00:26:47,690
They're too far away, anyway. It's Portland.

308
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,560
Jules, you didn't say no because of me.

309
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:54,651
Well, why would I wanna go all the way to portland for research that doesn't even work?

310
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:57,860
Because it does work.

311
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,213
I'm pregnant.

312
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:12,750
I'm pre-- I'm pregnant.

313
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,261
What?

314
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:16,473
Look, look.

315
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,882
I took a blood test, too.

316
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:21,181
I didn't want to tell you until I was sure.

317
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,392
It worked.

318
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:26,433
Yes.

319
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:36,282
All my life, all I've ever wanted was to have a baby,

320
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:38,573
and now, because of you, I'm gonna...

321
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:46,293
God, now I just need to get healthy.

322
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:50,001
Now I just need to get healthy

323
00:27:50,006 --> 00:27:53,881
so I can see the little bugger get into an ivy league school, you know?

324
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,463
You will. Of course you will. You will.

325
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:01,092
Hey, now you can tell that bastard ex-husband of yours what he can do with his ethics.

326
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:08,770
Because you're insuffrable and you're mean.

327
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,022
You asked me for the truth, mom.

328
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,812
Ed!

329
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:16,233
Yeah... let me call you later, okay?

330
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,653
Bye.

331
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:20,613
Hello, Jules. What's up?

332
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,863
She's pregnant.

333
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:23,823
Excuse me?

334
00:28:23,878 --> 00:28:26,122
It worked. Rachel's pregnant.

335
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,211
Julie, that's...

336
00:28:33,048 --> 00:28:38,760
Wow. Uh... I need, uh, I need to see your labs. We'll have to verify the data before--

337
00:28:38,805 --> 00:28:39,633
No.

338
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:43,303
I'm not interested in publishing, Ed. 

339
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,603
It's my sister.

340
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,680
Fine, then if you're not interested, why are you concerned if--

341
00:29:09,087 --> 00:29:10,252
Are you okay?

342
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:11,291
Yeah.

343
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:14,792
I just don't like blood too much.

344
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:16,290
Well...

345
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:20,212
then you probably won't wanna be looking at that.

346
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:24,973
So,  uh,

347
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:28,932
if you really can get off the island, why didn't you just take him to a facility?

348
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,223
Why all this?

349
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:34,140
Because ever since the sky turned purple, we--

350
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:36,982
What the hell happened?!

351
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,613
I just nicked an artery.

352
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,692
Isn't thatwhat you already did?!

353
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:44,242
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.

354
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,821
Oh... can you fix it?

355
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,782
Damn it.

356
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,382
- You got him?
- I got him.

357
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,463
- Karl.
- Nice ride.

358
00:30:00,595 --> 00:30:02,802
- Help me.
- We gotta go now, okay?

359
00:30:03,097 --> 00:30:04,303
Can you stand?

360
00:30:05,518 --> 00:30:06,341
All right, come on.

361
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,893
Okay.

362
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:12,470
So... you're the boss' daughter, huh?

363
00:30:13,398 --> 00:30:15,233
Never saw that coming.

364
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:19,401
Let's go, Cheech. We're goin' for a little ride.

365
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:21,190
Careful.

366
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,112
Okay. All right, easy.

367
00:30:23,825 --> 00:30:25,701
I'm gonna put you in the boat, all right?

368
00:30:31,086 --> 00:30:32,540
- Danny...
- No, Sawyer.

369
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,040
Danny!

370
00:30:35,046 --> 00:30:36,000
No!

371
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,102
Danny!

372
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:08,742
What happened? Is he--

373
00:31:08,745 --> 00:31:09,952
- I can't see.
- What?

374
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,991
I can't see. There's too much blood.

375
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,492
All right, get over here.

376
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:16,253
Tom, he's gonna die if you don't get over here right now.

377
00:31:20,507 --> 00:31:21,341
Go.

378
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,882
Get outta here.

379
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,221
You heard the lady.

380
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:31,600
Let's go.

381
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,310
Not you, Alex.

382
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,062
You're staying.

383
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,142
Why?

384
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,443
We both know your father,

385
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:41,652
and the only way he'll let Karl live is if you're here when he wakes up.

386
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,493
I'm sorry, Alex.

387
00:31:56,256 --> 00:31:57,793
Hey, Alex.

388
00:31:58,335 --> 00:31:59,252
Hey.

389
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,672
I missed you.

390
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:05,590
I know. I missed you, too.

391
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,971
You have to go away now,

392
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:12,513
but I'll see you real soon, okay?

393
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,721
I love you.

394
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,940
I have to go to sleep now.

395
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:35,950
Wait.

396
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:41,540
Easy. Okay, easy.

397
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:46,420
Wait, wait--

398
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,880
Hold it steady, damn it. Hold it steady.

399
00:32:51,977 --> 00:32:53,763
Jack, are you there?

400
00:32:58,475 --> 00:33:00,183
All right, hold that up to me.

401
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,441
The walkie-- hold it up to me.

402
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:04,350
- What about the surgery--
- Just do it!

403
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:13,911
Yeah, I'm here, Kate. You okay?

404
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:15,572
Yeah, I...

405
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:18,660
we've got a boat. They're letting us go.

406
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:20,043
Who's letting you go?

407
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,793
The blonde woman.

408
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,711
So you're safe, you and Sawyer?

409
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:26,172
Yes, yeah.

410
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:27,882
Tell me.

411
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:29,921
Tell you?

412
00:33:30,265 --> 00:33:32,973
The first day on the beach, the day of the crash, the story that I told you--

413
00:33:33,018 --> 00:33:34,840
if you're safe, tell me.

414
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,683
- You think this is the best time--
- Shut up!

415
00:33:40,568 --> 00:33:44,692
You... were doing surgery on a girl...

416
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:48,072
and you messed up.

417
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:50,030
You made a mistake.

418
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:54,400
You tore something on her back,

419
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,701
and all the nerves came loose...

420
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,661
and you said you were so afraid...

421
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:07,252
and you said the fear was so...

422
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,251
real,

423
00:34:11,558 --> 00:34:13,590
and you didn't know what to do...

424
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,220
so you counted to five...

425
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,103
and then you weren't afraid anymore...

426
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,521
and then it was just gone...

427
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:35,452
and you fixed her.

428
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,202
You saved her.

429
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,391
I need you to make me a promise, Kate.

430
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:00,640
Jack...

431
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,312
Promise me that you'll never come back here for me.

432
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,601
Don't come back, Kate.

433
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:08,942
Jack, where are you--

434
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,063
Turn it off.

435
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:12,941
Jack? Jack, please,where are--

436
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:27,582
Trades are comin' up.

437
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:30,963
We gotta go.

438
00:35:35,017 --> 00:35:36,172
Let's go.

439
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,810
We have some paperwork that we need you to sign,

440
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,312
but take your time. There's no rush.

441
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:32,561
Thank you.

442
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,130
Were you able to remove the tumor?

443
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:42,260
Yeah.

444
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,311
You'll want to do a biopsy, see if it's malignant.

445
00:37:55,278 --> 00:37:58,520
So what now, I just go back to my cell?

446
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:02,280
Until they figure out what to do with you.

447
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:07,572
"They"...

448
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:14,871
What did he say?

449
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:16,753
I'm sorry?

450
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:17,753
Ben--

451
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:21,961
what did he say that made youwant to save his life?

452
00:38:26,228 --> 00:38:28,431
It doesn't really matter what he said.

453
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,261
It matters to me.

454
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,481
After everything that I have been put through,

455
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,401
you owe me an answer.

456
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:41,690
And I wanna know what he said.

457
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:01,880
Tissue?

458
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:03,760
Thank you.

459
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:05,671
Thanks.

460
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:17,561
Have we met?

461
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,270
Hello, Dr. Burke.

462
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,363
- Mr. Alpert?
- I'm, uh,

463
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,451
so sorry for your loss.

464
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:29,990
What are you doing here?

465
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:34,243
I saw what happened on the news, and, uh, your office said you were down here.

466
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:37,962
I just wanted to express my condolences in person

467
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:41,961
before I went back up to Portland. This is Ethan. He's one of my colleagues.

468
00:39:42,008 --> 00:39:43,380
It's a pleasure to meet you.

469
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:52,182
He was hit by a bus.

470
00:39:52,478 --> 00:39:55,430
I know. They-- they say you were there when it happened. It must have been--

471
00:39:55,475 --> 00:39:59,063
No, no, in our interview,

472
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:04,480
I said that I wanted him to get hit by a bus.

473
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:10,321
Dr. Burke, I realize you're a little shook up right now,

474
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:13,870
but this is just a tragic accident. You can't blame yourself.

475
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:17,163
I don't even remember you saying that.

476
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,253
Why are you here, Mr. Alpert?

477
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:26,001
Look, uh...

478
00:40:26,425 --> 00:40:30,342
I know the timing is horrible, but we came because we're

479
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,182
that serious about getting you to come work with us.

480
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,472
Just give us six months.

481
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:41,023
If you need to, you'll be back before your sister gives birth.

482
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,983
How did you knowt hat my--

483
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,151
Well, we're very, uh, thorough in our recruitment process.

484
00:40:58,298 --> 00:40:59,621
Can my sister come?

485
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:01,961
Won't work. We're pretty remote.

486
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:04,750
She wouldn't have access to the treatment that she needs.

487
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,383
But it's Portland. There's plenty of clinics and--

488
00:41:07,428 --> 00:41:10,723
Well, actually, we're not quite in Portland.

489
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:23,603
I wanna know what he said.

490
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:33,282
I've been on this island for three years, Jack--

491
00:41:33,918 --> 00:41:37,873
3 years, 2 months and 28 days.

492
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,332
He said that if I...

493
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:46,540
let him live...

494
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,300
and I helped you...

495
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:59,060
that he would finally let me go home.
