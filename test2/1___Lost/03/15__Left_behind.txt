1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:02,377
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,254
There's a rental car parked out front.

3
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:08,008
Go to Sioux City. I want you to check inat the Sage Flower motel.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:10,594
Wait for me. I'll be there in the A.M.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,055
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,265
Go. Go.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,107
I don't care what Jack said.

8
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,610
They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that.

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,780
Obviously, the circumstances have changed. He may not want to be rescued.

10
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,530
If he's shaking handswith the Others, I'm sure he has a good reason.

11
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:34,951
We came here to rescue Jack, and that's what we're gonna do.

12
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,917
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,992
- I came to get you.
- Get outta here.

14
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,911
- Down!
- Don't hurt her!Aah!

15
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,332
I made a deal with them.

16
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:45,962
They're gonna let me go.

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,793
- Where?
- Home.

18
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:51,962
Jack, we need to go.

19
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:55,053
Hey, hold it right there!

20
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:57,470
Get your hands up! Get down!

21
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,222
I said get down!

22
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:00,892
What are you doing here, John?

23
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:03,391
- I'm sorry, Jack.
- Sorry for what?

24
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,652
I was just bringing you something to eat.

25
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,370
Enjoy your sandwich.

26
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:22,723
- Been on the road a while, huh?
- How long is it gonna take?

27
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:26,062
Well, your fan belt's shot. I'll take two days, maybe three.

28
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:29,230
Three days for a fan belt?

29
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,773
Welcome to Iowa.

30
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,113
Name's johnny.

31
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:38,953
I'm lucy.

32
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,763
If you need a lift into town, I finish up here in an hour.

33
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,683
- Call the cops.
- Fine. Whatever. Your loss.

34
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:06,893
Is there a problem, buddy?

35
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:10,440
Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem. I'm getting scammed here, that's the problem.

36
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,600
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What do you think, I'm an idiot?

37
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,773
Hey, man, if you don't want to buy 'em, you don't have to buy 'em.

38
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,401
Those are fake necklaces, and you're a rip-off artist.

39
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,400
- They're real.
- Call the cops.

40
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:22,033
If you don't want 'em, I'll sell 'em to somebody else.

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,570
Hey, let me see those.

44
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:33,292
I'll take the one on the end.

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,002
Whatever.

46
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,092
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,181
Can I get my money back?

48
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:52,481
Hey.

49
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,900
Why'd you help me?

50
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,942
Just one girl watching another girl's back, I guess.

51
00:04:01,155 --> 00:04:03,572
Or you're stranded here, and for some reason,

52
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:06,333
you didn't want that guy calling the cops.

53
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,790
I'll give you a ride into town. You buy me a drink.

54
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,563
What?

55
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:32,980
Kate.

56
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,983
John? What are you doing?

57
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:42,320
- Did they capture you?
- Yes, but...

58
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,991
only temporarily.

59
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,121
I came to say good-bye.

60
00:04:50,586 --> 00:04:51,753
Good-bye?

61
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,120
I'm leaving with them.

62
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:57,540
What the hell is going on? I mean, what are they doing to you? Are you brainwashed?

63
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:00,711
- Where did Jack go?
- Jack didn't go anywhere, Kate.

64
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,090
He's gonna have to stay behind, like you.

65
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,880
You can't trust them.

66
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,721
If they told you that they're gonna take you home, they're lying--

67
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:11,431
I don't wantto go home, Kate.

68
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,273
I want you to know, I made a strong case for you.

69
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,271
I told them that you were a good person--

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,150
reliable, smart, honest.

71
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:23,992
And then they told me who you were and what you had done.

72
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:28,201
Let's just say, forgiveness isn't one of their strong suits.

73
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,583
Good luck.

74
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,170
- John, where are you going?
- Coming out.

75
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,632
Hey, just... where is Jack and where is Sayid? Have you-- have you seen Rousseau?

76
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:51,311
John, please. What's happened to you?

77
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,310
I'm sorry, Kate.

78
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,383
What the hell's wrong with you?

79
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,011
Don't look at me, and pretend we're not talking.

80
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,260
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Good. Then scram.

81
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,640
Dude, you need to know that there's been some chatter.

82
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,770
After Paulo and Nikki and everything,

83
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:41,311
well, tomorrow there's gonna be a vote.

84
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,480
A vote for what?

85
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:44,533
To decide whether or not to banish you.

86
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,450
Banish me? Where?

87
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:50,700
Well, there was debate about that,

88
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,702
but the consensus was half a mile down the beach.

89
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,200
Consensus?

90
00:06:55,336 --> 00:06:58,331
I'm only saying this because there may be a way to fix it--

91
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,923
to, like, make amends.

92
00:07:02,716 --> 00:07:04,133
I don't do amends.

93
00:07:04,636 --> 00:07:08,881
You might want to ask yourself about all the good stuff that comes from being part of this...

94
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,221
society.

95
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:13,301
I mean, you can't even feed yourself.

96
00:07:13,556 --> 00:07:14,931
You use our latrine,

97
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,392
drink the water that steve brings every morning to the trough...

98
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:19,180
What?

99
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:24,942
You know how for 3 days, 10 hours and 15 minutes I ain't allowed to use nicknames?

100
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:25,773
Yeah.

101
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,573
Well, you, sir... Hugo,

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:35,032
are rotund, annoying, and you're ruinin' my damn view.

103
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,950
How's that for amends?

104
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,450
You're making a big mistake, dude.

105
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:43,792
Banish me.

106
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:14,341
How about you tell me your name?

107
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:18,302
- It's Lucy.
- And what's your real name?

108
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:21,521
Next time somebody asks, you don't think about it.

109
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,390
- I didn't think--
- Not even for a second.

110
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:28,230
- So why Lucy?
- She's a saint.

111
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:31,403
I had to memorize them all in Sunday school, so I figure

112
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,243
they're probably still rattling around my brain.

113
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:36,703
What makes a girl who went to sunday school scared of cops?

114
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,963
A few months ago, I killed my stepfather.

115
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,041
I escaped from the marshal who arrested me for it.

116
00:09:51,848 --> 00:09:52,800
Why?

117
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,432
'Cause he was a bad guy.

118
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,562
So...

119
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:05,103
what the hell are you doing in Iowa?

120
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,152
I want to talk to my mother.

121
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,191
You're gonna have a really hard time doing that,

122
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:17,112
because if you did what you just said you did,

123
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:20,372
the feds are gonna be watching her 24/7.

124
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,780
- I'll figure something out.
- Oh, you will, huh?

125
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,953
What, you want to help me?

126
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:34,763
- Absolutely.
- Why?

127
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:42,722
I fell in love with the wrong guy,

128
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:46,311
and then I gave him my life savings.

129
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:50,481
He conned me and embarrassed me.

130
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:53,021
He was a bad guy.

131
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:59,912
So... I'll help you get the meeting with your mom... Lucy,

132
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:02,991
because one of us deserves something good.

133
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,321
I ain't gonna get the korean vote.

134
00:12:33,465 --> 00:12:34,211
Come on, come on.

135
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,360
All right, let's do it.

136
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:03,531
Do what?

137
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:08,873
I'm ready to do it-- make amends, change the vote.

138
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,581
I don't wanna be banished, okay? You happy?

139
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,331
Dude, you stink.

140
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,171
What is that, fish?

141
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:20,250
No.

142
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,171
Did you try to gut one yourself?

143
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,930
How have you not learned that by now?

144
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,931
I mean, we've been here, like, three months.

145
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,607
- Could we just do this?
-  Do what?

146
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:33,812
Make nice?

147
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:37,650
Apologize for calling me all those names.

148
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:44,191
I'm really sorry I called you "rotund."

149
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:47,493
- Really?
- Oh, god. You're worse than a girl.

150
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,581
Come on. Let's spread the love.

151
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,860
- What the hell am I doing here?
- Why don't you tell me?

152
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:27,452
- I don't know.
- Well, I don't know either!

153
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:29,453
So why don't you let go of my wrist?

154
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,311
So what the hell happened?

155
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:59,442
I was making a cup of tea. Canister came in through the window.

156
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:04,443
So that'd you do to piss 'em off?

157
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:06,780
You're wasting your time.

158
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:10,362
The knife is too big. We need something smaller. A safety pin--

159
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:13,413
- We're going back.
- What?

160
00:15:13,626 --> 00:15:15,583
They did this to us. Why would we go back?

161
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:19,833
You say "they" like you didn't lock me in a cage and watch me break rocks all day.

162
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:27,092
We're going back to your village because

163
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:30,050
my friends were probably gassed, just like us.

164
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:31,682
Your people are gone anyway.

165
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,551
I saw them all pack up and leave.

166
00:15:33,686 --> 00:15:34,262
What?

167
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:36,523
Locke came to me to say good-bye.

168
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,392
They were taking off, going somewhere else.

169
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,943
- Going? Going where?
- He didn't exactly tell me.

170
00:15:46,157 --> 00:15:49,533
Welcome to the wonderful world of not knowing what the hell's going on.

171
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:20,773
Go! Go! Go!

172
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:24,021
On the ground! Get down! On the ground!

173
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,521
Let me see those hands!

174
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,532
Let me see those hands!

175
00:16:30,997 --> 00:16:33,201
Long time no see, Austen.

176
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,372
Who the hell are you?

177
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,462
I'm just selling bibles.

178
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:14,033
Hi.

179
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:19,621
They questioned me for half an hour.

180
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:21,622
He confiscated my case.

181
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:24,582
He was asking me about selling bibles and...

182
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,921
Oh, it's a good thing I know how to lie.

183
00:17:27,135 --> 00:17:28,921
Yeah, now we know what we're up against, right?

184
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:33,222
Yeah, now we know that there were six guys waiting to take you down, Lucy.

185
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,262
Yeah, it's okay. I'll figure it out.

186
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,973
Figure it out?

187
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,932
That marshal-- I don't know what you did to him,

188
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:43,933
but if he ever gets his hands on you, it is gonna be you or him.

189
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:47,603
Look, if you've changed your mind, if you don't wanna help me, I get it.

190
00:17:47,737 --> 00:17:51,573
No, I do wanna help you, but if I'm lying to federal agents, Lucy,

191
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,321
so that you can have a chat with your mom...

192
00:17:54,495 --> 00:17:58,492
then I at least need to know that there's a pretty good reason.

193
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:06,672
He... used to get drunk and beat up my mom,

194
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,133
so I blew up his house.

195
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,712
I...

196
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:14,133
made it look like an accident--

197
00:18:14,268 --> 00:18:15,922
a gas leak.

198
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:19,092
Took out an insurance policy on the house...

199
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:25,022
for her. Set her up for life.

200
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:33,820
And then she gave me up. Chose him over me.

201
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,282
So the reason I need to talk to her is...

202
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,492
someone I love...

203
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,581
someone who's supposed to care about me

204
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:47,831
betrayed me, and I wanna know why.

205
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,793
Well...

206
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,460
then let's go find out.

207
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:02,513
What are you doing?

208
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,181
Whoever dragged us out here left a trail.

209
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,893
It'll lead us back to where we came from. Let's go.

210
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:09,772
It's gonna rain.

211
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,900
Don't you think we should wait till morning?

212
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:14,323
No.

213
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,413
Why?

214
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,503
Why what?

215
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,000
Why would they handcuff you to me and then drag us all the way out into the jungle?

216
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,581
Ben has a thing for mind games.

217
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,881
Is that why he left you behind?

218
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,261
Do we really have to talk?

219
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:39,593
Nope.

220
00:19:46,976 --> 00:19:49,391
Come on. If the trail gets wet, I'll lose it.

221
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:53,190
I hope you're not dragging me all the way back there with you for him.

222
00:19:54,238 --> 00:19:56,863
- Excuse me?
- I hope you're not going back

223
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:57,941
for Jack,

224
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:03,870
because I was standing right there when he told you not to come back,

225
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,041
and now that you've ruined his chance to get off the island--

226
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:21,843
You done?!

227
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,683
I said, are you done?!

228
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,901
I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

229
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:39,282
What the hell was that?!

230
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:50,622
Get up!

231
00:20:50,836 --> 00:20:53,253
You dislocated my shoulder!

232
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:03,843
Wait! Come here.

233
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:09,811
Get down. Get down.

234
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:12,813
- What the hell--
- Shh!

235
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,982
Are we safe?

236
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,612
You tell me.

237
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,962
I ain't kissin' no damn baby.

238
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,540
Claire's, like, really influential.

239
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,842
If she votes for you to stay, you're home free, dude.

240
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:23,592
Well, why wouldn't she vote for me?

241
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:25,631
It's not like I ever done anything bad to her.

242
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,092
Nah, but you never did anything good for her either.

243
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,140
And have you ever even asked how Aaron is?

244
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:36,141
Well, I know how he is. He... cries loud, and he smells.

245
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:37,733
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

246
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,560
You're sarcastic. People don't like that.

247
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:40,311
All right.

248
00:22:40,948 --> 00:22:44,573
So I go over... and do what?

249
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,860
Moms love it when you show an interest in their babies.

250
00:22:48,996 --> 00:22:51,490
So go over there, say something nice,

251
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:55,583
call her "Claire"... and give her this.

252
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,370
I know you can do it, dude.

253
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,090
Hey, Claire.

254
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:06,381
Hey.

255
00:23:08,018 --> 00:23:10,721
Hey there... little baby...

256
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:12,601
Aaron.

257
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:18,771
Is, uh... is there anything I can do for you?

258
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,980
No. I just came by to see your baby.

259
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:23,190
He's not as

260
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,990
wrinkly as he was a couple weeks ago.

261
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,251
Yeah, I... I guess he's not. Thanks.

262
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:43,422
Oh, and, uh, this is for you.

263
00:23:44,635 --> 00:23:45,552
Thank you.

264
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:49,341
I don't like... blankets.

265
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:54,140
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

266
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,282
Do you think it's gone? Are we safe?

267
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,111
Are you serious?

268
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:11,660
You've never seen that?

269
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,162
If you don't believe me, you can always pull my other shoulder out of its socket.

270
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:19,291
- I wasn't trying to--
- Don't flatter yourself.

271
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:22,711
This is the fourth time it's been dislocated.

272
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:37,471
- Give me your hand.
- Why?

273
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,392
'Cause I want you to pop it back in.

274
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,683
- No, I'm not gonna--
- You're gonna.

275
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:45,023
Right now it feels like there's broken glass under my skin,

276
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,982
and if it weren't for you,

277
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,482
I would be on my way home right now.

278
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:51,861
Jack told me not to come back to protect me,

279
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:54,321
because he didn't want me to get hurt.

280
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,793
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

281
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:03,331
We have cameras on the cages, Kate...

282
00:25:04,506 --> 00:25:06,381
All of them.

283
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:11,342
He saw you... you and Sawyer.

284
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:15,930
The reason Jack told you not to come back

285
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:20,223
wasn't because he didn't want you to get hurt.

286
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:24,522
It was because you broke his heart.

287
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,610
So...

288
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:33,402
grab my wrist, push up and twist.

289
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,091
Why do we gotta be out here so damn early?

290
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:58,510
You asked me to help you catch a boar.

291
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:01,350
Well, this is when they break cover to eat.

292
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,060
Looks like they picked a day to sleep in.

293
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,981
So what's your angle, brother?

294
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,402
My angle?

295
00:26:09,525 --> 00:26:13,573
Well, you... haven't spoken three words to me,

296
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,611
and then... suddenly you want to be my huntin' partner.

297
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:18,821
My angle...

298
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,741
is I got hearts and minds to change,

299
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,501
and politics is all about bribes.

300
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,923
Since money don't mean squat on this island,

301
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:32,591
I gotta give the people something they like...

302
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,802
- and people like meat.
- Shh.

303
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:01,070
How's your shoulder?

304
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,871
- Awesome.
- Then let's get going.

305
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:17,301
Thank you.

306
00:27:18,265 --> 00:27:19,890
You're welcome, sweetheart.

307
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:40,160
Oh, my god! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

308
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,072
- No worries.
- I'm such an idiot.

309
00:27:42,245 --> 00:27:43,910
It happens all the time, sweetheart.

310
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:46,752
Oh, thank you.

311
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:08,313
Hi, mom.

312
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:12,772
What are you doing here, Katherine?

313
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,900
You look good.

314
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,823
I asked you what you were doing here.

315
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,912
I want to know why you told them what I did to Wayne.

316
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:37,211
I thought maybe you came because you wanted to say you were sorry.

317
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:39,552
I'm not sorry.

318
00:28:41,848 --> 00:28:45,011
He hit you. He treated you like a dog, and you--

319
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:48,063
You can't help who you love, Katherine.

320
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:51,560
And for good or bad, I loved him.

321
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:54,403
And you burnt him alive.

322
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,943
You turned on the gas, and you lit a match.

323
00:28:58,075 --> 00:29:00,650
You murdered him in cold blood.

324
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:03,821
I did it for you.

325
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:05,282
No.

326
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:09,121
What you did, you did for yourself.

327
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:22,761
I have to go back to work. Because you are my daughter, I'm not gonna tell the two men

328
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:25,893
sitting at the table who've been following me for the last month that you are here,

329
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,603
but I swear to god, Katie...

330
00:29:29,016 --> 00:29:30,772
if I ever see you again,

331
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:35,481
the first thing I will do is yell for help.

332
00:29:39,367 --> 00:29:40,400
Good-bye.

333
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,960
- Did he say that to you?
- Sorry?

334
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,763
That I broke his heart.

335
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,631
He didn't have to.

336
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,313
You don't know anything about him.

337
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:13,482
I know where he was born. I know what his parents did for a living.

338
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:16,903
I know that he was married and who he was married to.

339
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:21,572
I know why he got a divorce. I know how his father died.

340
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:26,532
I know his height, his weight, his birthday and his blood type.

341
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:30,910
What do you know about him, Kate?

342
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:37,793
Let's go.

343
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:46,841
Run.

344
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:47,681
Run.

345
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,592
Run!

346
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:06,703
Get up! Get up!

347
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,530
Run! Run! Come on!

348
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,083
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

349
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,292
I know what happens when you set those things off!

350
00:31:14,338 --> 00:31:16,123
- No! Kate-- We don't need to!
- We will go alongside them.

351
00:31:16,256 --> 00:31:17,750
We can go around there-- off!

352
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,083
- Damn it!
- What...

353
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,553
You're gonna want to be over here.

354
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:36,482
Kate, come on!

355
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:18,893
All right.

356
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,482
We don't know what it is, but we know that it doesn't like our fences.

357
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:23,610
You had a key.

358
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:29,443
They left me behind, too. They gassed me.I know that you don't care,

359
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,533
but the people I spent the last three years of my life with--

360
00:32:32,706 --> 00:32:34,202
they just left me.

361
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:41,001
I thought that maybe...

362
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:44,753
maybe if I could make you think that we were in it together...

363
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:51,803
maybe I wouldn't get left behind again.

364
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:28,171
Oh. It's delicious!

365
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:31,130
Just a little Dharma A1 and paprika...

366
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:36,723
I hope you'll remember this little barbecue at your meetin' later.

367
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,261
Oh, what meetin'?

368
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:41,981
Hurley told me about the vote.

369
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:45,602
Vote? Since when did anyone around here vote?

370
00:33:55,115 --> 00:33:56,533
You son of a bitch.

371
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,911
There wasn't ever gonna be no vote.

372
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:03,751
But... wasn't it nice... being nice?

373
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:06,002
You tricked me into being decent?

374
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,502
That's gotta be the lamest con in the history of cons.

375
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,922
It wasn't a con, dude.

376
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:12,763
If you're gonna be our temporary leader, you need to do some damage control.

377
00:34:12,885 --> 00:34:13,880
Leader?

378
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:15,631
What the hell are you smoking?

379
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,810
Jack's gone. Locke's gone. Kate and Sayid...

380
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,773
You're all we got.

381
00:34:23,188 --> 00:34:24,601
When Paulo and Nikki died,

382
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,401
we all looked to you.

383
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:30,733
Then again, you totally tried to steal their diamonds, but we wanted to look to you.

384
00:34:30,907 --> 00:34:35,320
Look around. You made everyone happy.

385
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:38,280
Just for today,

386
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,870
they can eat boar,

387
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:42,951
laugh and forget that they're totally screwed.

388
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:47,581
And you did that for 'em, dude-- you.

389
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:51,503
And what if I don't want to be the leader?

390
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:56,182
Yeah, well, I don't think Jack wanted to, either.

391
00:34:57,635 --> 00:34:58,682
Sucks for you, dude.

392
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,400
Sayid's in one of those backyards down there.

393
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:35,821
I'll go get him.

394
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,403
You should get Jack.

395
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:55,671
Jack!

396
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:58,921
Jack, hey. Jack, wake up. It's me.

397
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:09,603
What happened?

398
00:37:10,935 --> 00:37:12,351
They all left.

399
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,440
All left?

400
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:23,071
Why?

401
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:24,411
Because of me.

402
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,700
I'm so sorry.

403
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:32,542
I should've listened to you. I never...

404
00:37:38,928 --> 00:37:40,882
I wanted to come back to help you...

405
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:45,012
but you didn't need me to.

406
00:37:49,315 --> 00:37:52,063
And now because of me, you can't go...

407
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:06,200
I'm so sorry.

408
00:38:09,877 --> 00:38:11,750
I am so sorry.

409
00:38:15,548 --> 00:38:16,790
They just...

410
00:38:18,598 --> 00:38:19,592
left?

411
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,592
Even... even Juliet?

412
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,271
No, they left her, too.

413
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:40,901
Why?

414
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:47,451
You know her better than I do.

415
00:38:53,878 --> 00:38:55,003
Now what?

416
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:01,251
Now...

417
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,431
now we go back.

418
00:39:41,386 --> 00:39:44,131
- Thanks for everything, Cassidy.
- You got it.

419
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:50,510
So... this guy who ripped you off...

420
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:54,061
you wanna give me his name, tell me where I can find him?

421
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,980
You almost got arrested for me, Cassidy. I wanna help you.

422
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,272
I'm pregnant.

423
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,700
It's his. The baby's his,

424
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,450
and I still love him.

425
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,780
So call the cops. Have him locked up.

426
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,872
Will you ever forgive your mom for calling the cops?

427
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:18,331
No.

428
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,292
No, I won't.

429
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,180
Thanks, Lucy.

430
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:35,012
My name's Kate.

431
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,781
- Hey.
- Hey.

432
00:40:54,707 --> 00:40:56,081
You okay?

433
00:40:56,418 --> 00:40:58,622
Yeah. You?

434
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:02,582
Yeah.

435
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:09,921
Jack.

436
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:14,851
Sayid.

437
00:41:15,646 --> 00:41:18,600
I've checked all the houses. Everyone's gone.

438
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:21,142
No weapons, no trail.

439
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:25,062
It's like 50 people disappeared into thin air.

440
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,980
We should take what we can find

441
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,442
and head out while we still got light.

442
00:41:34,455 --> 00:41:36,622
She is not coming with us.

443
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,122
Yes, she is.

444
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:42,542
Why?

445
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,762
Because they left her behind, too.

446
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:10,782
