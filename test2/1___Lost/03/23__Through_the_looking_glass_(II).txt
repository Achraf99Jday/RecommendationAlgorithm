00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:08,969
You okay?

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,220
Yeah, I just...

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,877
got a rock in my shoe.

5
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:25,776
He didt mean it, you know.

6
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:28,968
What?

7
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:30,282
Sawyer.

8
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,097
When he said that he didn't want you
to go with him... He didn't mean it.

9
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:36,187
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

10
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:39,469
He was trying to protect you.

11
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,330
That's why I asked you
not to come back for me.

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,812
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

13
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,470
He'd never do it for you.

14
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:05,158
Because I love you.

15
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,221
Can I help you?

16
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,907
Sorry. I, uh...

17
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,561
Actually, I came, uh...

18
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:09,833
Is the funeral over?

19
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,657
There was no funeral, sir.
Only a viewing.

20
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:14,782
Nobody showed up.

21
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:17,845
Nobody?

22
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,568
- You sure?
- Just you.

23
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,015
My deepest condolences.

24
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:24,282
Friend or family?

25
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,159
Neither.

26
00:03:30,741 --> 00:03:32,226
Would you like me to open it up?

27
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:33,468
No.

28
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,593
Take your time.

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,955
Damn it.

30
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:41,763
How much further?

31
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:43,262
About an hour.

32
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:48,198
The radio tower...
when was the last time you were there?

33
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,830
The day I recorded the message.

34
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,821
I'll take you to the tower,
but I'm not leaving the island.

35
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:56,696
What?

36
00:04:56,808 --> 00:04:58,467
There's no place for me back there.

37
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,564
This is my home now.

38
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,448
We need to talk.

39
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,468
What did Ben say?
Can we kill him?

40
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,992
Is it possible to turn
this equipment off?

41
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,100
What?

44
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:55,419
You are the only ones who have it?

45
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,174
Yeah. Why?

46
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:00,259
What would happen
if the station were to be flooded?

47
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:03,502
Nothing. The casing for
the equipment is waterproof.

48
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,719
It'll keep going forever.

49
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,075
Then why do you need to be here?

50
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,438
Because Ben told us to.

51
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:09,064
We were following orders.

52
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,345
And you never asked why?

53
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,340
No, because I trust him,
and I trust Jacob,

54
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,655
and the minute I start
questioning orders, this whole thing...

55
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,942
everything that we're doing here...
falls apart.

56
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:24,998
She makes an excellent point.

57
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,909
Please...

58
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:50,721
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

59
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,569
I, too, am following orders.

60
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:06,267
No, des! Des! Don't.

61
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,468
We need her.

62
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,593
Hi. I'm Benjamin. I don't
believe we've had the pleasure...

63
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:36,769
Don't talk to him!

64
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:40,969
What do you want?

65
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:42,995
Just a moment of your time...

66
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:46,107
To talk, you and me, alone.

67
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:48,408
For what?

68
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,533
You've just killed seven of my people.

69
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,526
The least you can give me
is five minutes.

70
00:07:57,793 --> 00:07:58,912
Is he alone?

71
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,084
There's only two sets
of tracks... his and hers.

72
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,159
Five minutes.

73
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,019
I'm sorry, sir there are no more
refills left on this prescription.

74
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:40,463
Well, that... That's a mistake.
I, uh...

75
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,246
I only refilled it twice.
Could you check again?

76
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:45,590
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,

77
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:48,331
and that was the third refill,
so there's nothing I can do.

78
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,502
Fine. I've got another prescription
right here.

79
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,164
Hey, I know you.

80
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,598
You're the hero.

81
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:58,653
- I'm not a hero.
- Yeah, we...

82
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:01,127
We saw it on tv.
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

83
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,588
Just give this guy whatever he needs.
You know what he did?

84
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:04,694
Here, just... Here...

85
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:06,338
Oxycodone.

86
00:09:06,651 --> 00:09:09,038
Dr. Shephard, you can't write
a prescription for yourself.

87
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:11,539
That's not me.
That's Dr. Christian shephard.

88
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,535
I'm Dr. Jack shephard.
He's my father.

89
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:15,494
I'm gonna call his office to confirm...

90
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:18,369
- He's out of town right now.-
I'm sure somebody in the office...

91
00:09:19,968 --> 00:09:21,027
Don't bother.

92
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:37,777
Have a seat.

93
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:49,300
Not so long ago, Jack,
I made a decision

94
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,325
that took the lives
of over 40 people in a single day.

95
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,721
I'm telling you this because...

96
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:02,087
history is about
to repeat itself right here,

97
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:03,088
right now.

98
00:10:03,463 --> 00:10:04,673
Let me guess. You've...

99
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:07,475
You've got us surrounded,
and if I don't do what you say,

100
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,590
you're gonna...

101
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,328
You're gonna kill all my people.

102
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,221
No, Jack. You are.

103
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:17,866
And how am I gonna do that?

104
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,441
The woman you're traveling with...

105
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,681
The one who parachuted onto
the island from a helicopter...

106
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,668
she's not who she says she is.

107
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,589
- She's not, huh?
- No, she's not.

108
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:32,712
Then who is she?

109
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,400
She's a representative of some people

110
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,874
who have been trying
to find this island.

111
00:10:39,356 --> 00:10:40,831
She's one of the bad guys.

112
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,002
I almost forgot. You're the...

113
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:47,077
You're the good guys.

114
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Jack, listen to me.

115
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,238
If you phone her boat,

116
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,376
every single living person
on this island

117
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:55,012
will be killed.

118
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,324
So here's what has to happen.

119
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:03,026
Get that device...

120
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,826
the phone she carries with her...

121
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,651
and give it to me.

122
00:11:08,255 --> 00:11:09,276
I will turn around.

123
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:11,007
We'll go back to my people.

124
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,734
You will turn around,
go back to your people.

125
00:11:15,212 --> 00:11:16,422
I'm not going anywhere.

126
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,250
May I have my walkie back?

127
00:11:27,785 --> 00:11:30,004
- What?
- There's something you need to hear.

128
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:32,151
Please?

129
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,587
Thank you.

130
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,183
Tom, are you there?

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,733
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

132
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,226
Your plan killed seven of my people,

133
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:57,704
but the ones that you failed to kill
are now holding your friends...

134
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,490
Jin, Sayid, Bernard...
at gunpoint.

135
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:02,448
<i>Jack, don't give him any--</i>

136
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,419
<i>- Leave him alone!
- I said shut up!</i>

137
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:11,031
And what's to stop me
from snapping your neck...

138
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:14,195
Tom, unless you hear my voice
in one minute, shoot all three of them.

139
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:24,007
Bring me the phone.

140
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,768
40 seconds.

141
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,797
No.
I'm getting them all off the island...

142
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:35,714
- All of 'em!
- Let me ask you something.

143
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,453
Why do you want to leave the island?

144
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,840
What is it you so desperately
wanna get back to?

145
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:41,955
You have no one.

146
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:45,557
Your father's dead. Your wife left you,
moved on with another man.

147
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,757
Can you just not wait
to get back to the hospital,

148
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,529
get back to fixing things?

149
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,698
It's 20 seconds now.

150
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,302
Just get me the phone.

151
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,704
Ten seconds.

152
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,107
Bring me the phone.

153
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,902
- I'm not bluffing.
- I won't do it!

154
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,227
Four... three...

155
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:15,705
I'm so sorry, Jack.

156
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:49,129
Tom, are you there?

157
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,958
Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

158
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:57,365
I'm gonna lead my people
up to the radio tower,

159
00:13:58,328 --> 00:14:00,854
and I'm gonna make a call,
and I'm gonna get 'em

160
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,081
all rescued...

161
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,202
Every one of 'em.

162
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,921
And then I'm gonna come find you...

163
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:09,978
and I'm gonna kill you.

164
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,947
- What's the code?
- Go away.

165
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,713
Let's just get this over with, okay?

166
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,684
- What's the code?
- She's not gonna tell you.

167
00:14:25,722 --> 00:14:27,941
- Yeah, she's gonna tell me.
- What makes you say that?

168
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,314
'cause you said it's my destiny
to turn off that jammer.

169
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:33,283
We're both gonna die
down here, all right?

170
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:34,664
Let's be perfectly honest.

171
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,820
That one-eyed maniac
just killed your friend.

172
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,084
He shot you in the back.

173
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,715
It would appear
that your glorious leader, Ben,

174
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:41,819
put him up to it.

175
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:44,397
Are you a sodding idiot?

176
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:50,167
You have the opportunity
to make Ben very, very angry.

177
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:52,511
Why would you not take that?

178
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,852
- 5-4-5...
- What?

179
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,676
- 8-7-5-5...
- Is that a code?

180
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:04,323
- 4-3-7...
- Wait.

181
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:06,736
- Start again, start again.
- 6...

182
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,008
Start from the beginning.

183
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:09,528
- 1-3.
- Start from the beginning.

184
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:10,821
Start again.

185
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:12,939
Wake up, wake up.

186
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,448
Start again. Start again.

187
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:15,886
<i>Good vibrations.</i>

188
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,573
What?

189
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:19,196
Beach Boys.

190
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:21,759
<i>Good Vibrations.</i>

191
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:25,559
On the keypad.

192
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:26,947
The numbers...

193
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:29,634
They're notes.

194
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:35,834
It was programmed by a musician.

195
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,669
Tie him up.

196
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,661
He's coming with us.

197
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,174
What?

198
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,911
This is your mother.

199
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:07,893
Will you help me tie him up?

200
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,215
What happened?
What'd he say?

201
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:31,356
It's not important right now.

202
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,150
- Just get everybody together.
- Jack, your knules.

203
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:48,922
What happened?

204
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,235
He killed them.

205
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,484
All three of 'em. He...

206
00:18:03,024 --> 00:18:04,214
He radioed the beach.

207
00:18:06,063 --> 00:18:07,226
And I let it happen.

208
00:18:12,046 --> 00:18:13,307
I had to let it happen.

209
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,340
We can't tell Rose...

210
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:18,746
or Sun, not yet.

211
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,775
We gotta keep moving.
I promised Sayid

212
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,927
that we would keep moving.

213
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,457
So why did you bring him back?

214
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,573
Why didn't you just kill him?

215
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,259
Because I want him to see it.

216
00:18:36,358 --> 00:18:38,109
I want him to experience the moment

217
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,496
that we get off this island,
and I want him to know...

218
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,610
That he failed.

219
00:18:49,524 --> 00:18:50,855
And then I'll kill him.

220
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,831
It was an order, Tom.
We had to follow it.

221
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,828
Ben didn't know what the hell
he's talking about.

222
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:03,152
He's lost it.
I mean, look at what they did to us.

223
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,785
Instead of putting three bullets
in the damn sand,

224
00:19:06,055 --> 00:19:07,676
we should've killed them for real.

225
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,635
All they got left is
three guys and four guns.

226
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,429
And all we've got, James,
are two people and no guns.

227
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,347
So we'll wait till night.

228
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:29,724
That isn't gonna change the fact
that we're unarmed.

229
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:32,622
If you wanna kill yourself, that's fine,
but before you go and try...

230
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:37,795
You hear that?

231
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:06,823
Stay in the bus, hero.

232
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,827
Stay right there, Tom.

233
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:49,672
I give up.

234
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,633
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

235
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,487
Dude, it was over.
He surrendered.

236
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:13,279
I didn't believe him.

237
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:58,620
What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?

238
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:00,381
I was just, uh...

239
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:02,855
I was just checking the, uh...

240
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,370
The Arlen charts.

241
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:08,120
Just wanted to...
Wanted to see how the operation went.

242
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,130
I left three messages on your
voice mail. You didn't get them?

243
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:13,951
My phone's broken.

244
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:18,989
Let's go to my office.

245
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:21,313
For what?

246
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:23,987
We need to have a talk.
Come on.

247
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,252
You know, I know that you're...

248
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,709
You're new around here,
so you don't know much about me...

249
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:30,885
I know enough.

250
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:32,426
So let's go to my office...

251
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,490
If you got something to say to me,
say it to me...

252
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:36,377
Right here.

253
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,668
Will you excuse us, please?

254
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:48,437
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,

255
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:50,262
woke up in recovery
about two hours ago.

256
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:53,149
She was in some pain
but highly responsive

257
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,623
to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

258
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,625
Well, that's...

259
00:22:59,376 --> 00:23:00,376
That's great.

260
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,888
But then she described
the series of events

261
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:04,316
that caused her accident.

262
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:08,062
She says she was driving over the bridge

263
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:10,471
when she saw a man
standing on top of the railing

264
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,038
about to jump off.

265
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:18,552
She was distracted
and lost control of her car.

266
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:20,168
She ran into the median,

267
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,253
rolled over and was hit
by the van behind her.

268
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,443
So the obvious question here...

269
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,954
is how did you get
to that flaming car so fast?

270
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:35,819
What were you doing
on that bridge?

271
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,071
Do you know how many years
I've worked at this hospital?

272
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:48,688
Do you know...

273
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:50,901
Anything about me?

274
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,867
Do you have any idea...

275
00:23:55,065 --> 00:23:56,461
what I've been through?

276
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,264
How much have you had to drink today?

277
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,028
Okay, I'll tell you what.
You do this...

278
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:04,973
You get my father down here.

279
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:08,665
Get him down here right now,
and if I'm drunker than he is,

280
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:09,979
you can fire me.

281
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:14,415
Don't you look at me like that.

282
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,908
Don't you... pity me.

283
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:19,057
- I'm trying to help you...
- You can't help me!

284
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,108
<i>Attention, Others. Come in, Others.</i>

285
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,317
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

286
00:24:56,491 --> 00:24:58,345
<i>I want you to know
that we got you bastards,</i>

287
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:01,615
<i>and unless the rest of you
wanna be blown up,</i>

288
00:25:02,198 --> 00:25:04,089
<i>you best stay away from our beach.</i>

289
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,713
<i>Where are you? What's going on?</i>

290
00:25:09,973 --> 00:25:11,446
Dude, I'm back at the beach.

291
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:12,946
What?

292
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:15,300
I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer.

293
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:16,974
I saved them.

294
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,910
You're...

295
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,246
They're okay? Juliet...

296
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:26,028
Everyone's fine. Me, Sawyer,
Juliet, Sayid, Jin, bernard.

297
00:25:26,811 --> 00:25:27,911
Wait.

298
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,054
Bernard and Jin and Sayid...
They're with you?

299
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,504
Yeah, dude, I told you.
I saved them all.

300
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,847
<i>Stay where you are.
We're almost up to the tower.</i>

301
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:53,758
<i>- You'll be safer there.</i>
- Yeah, I gotcha.

302
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:56,368
We'll stay put until you,
like, you know, phone home.

303
00:25:59,632 --> 00:26:00,632
What about Charlie?

304
00:26:00,818 --> 00:26:02,145
Did he make it back yet?

305
00:26:02,443 --> 00:26:05,382
Not yet, but they're probably
paddling home as we speak.

306
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:07,390
Don't worry.
I'm sure he's fine.

307
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:22,875
There's diving gear
on those racks, yeah?

308
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:25,738
- Aye. It's plenty.
- Why don't you take care of that?

309
00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:28,340
- I'll tap out <i>Good Vibrations</i>.
- All right, mate.

310
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:32,868
You get any flashes?

311
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:35,913
No. Nothin'.

312
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:39,832
I'll meet you back here, then.

313
00:27:32,788 --> 00:27:34,002
So much for fate.

314
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,466
"Incoming transmission"?

315
00:27:54,517 --> 00:27:56,611
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

316
00:27:56,707 --> 00:27:58,270
<i>Who is this?
Who am I speaking to?</i>

317
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:01,662
Charlie Pace.
I'm a survivor of flight

318
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,031
8-1-5...
Oceanic, flight 8-1-5.

319
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,098
<i>Where are you?</i>

320
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,944
We're on an island.
We're alive.

321
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,085
<i>An island? Well, where?
What's the location?</i>

322
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:12,801
I don't know. Who's this?

323
00:28:13,033 --> 00:28:14,306
<i>This is Penelope.</i>

324
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:15,839
<i>Penelope Widmore.</i>

325
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,932
<i>How did you get this frequency?</i>

326
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,629
<i>Did you just say, "Desmond"?</i>

327
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:27,998
Yeah, he's here.
He's with me.

328
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:29,371
<i>Is he okay?</i>

329
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:30,469
He's brilliant.

330
00:28:30,531 --> 00:28:31,651
Hey, are you on the boat?

331
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,560
- <i>What boat?</i>
- Your boat...

332
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:34,893
80 miles offshore.

333
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:37,487
Naomi, parachutist.

334
00:28:37,603 --> 00:28:38,761
<i>I'm not on a boat.</i>

335
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:40,323
<i>Who's Naomi?</i>11

336
00:29:13,194 --> 00:29:14,429
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

337
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:24,924
Hey, Aaron, it's okay, sweetie.

338
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:26,447
What's the matter?

339
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:28,895
I don't know.
I think he's just a bit scared.

340
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,850
Hard to blame him.

341
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:35,853
What is it?

342
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,209
What's your boyfriend's name...

343
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,037
The rock star
who swam down to the station?

344
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:40,038
Charlie. Why?

345
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:44,987
Charlie just got us rescued.

346
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:51,825
He did it!

347
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,981
- Your friend bloody well did it.
- What?

348
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,664
The green light... it's on.
The jamming stopped.

349
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,039
Use it, then.

350
00:31:58,412 --> 00:31:59,412
All right.

351
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:02,913
<i>4-2.</i>

352
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:08,975
What's this?

353
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:12,629
It's Rousseau's message.
It's still blocking the signal.

354
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:15,225
It doesn't matter. We're here.

355
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,242
<i>Iteration 1-7-5-0-4-5.</i>

356
00:33:13,347 --> 00:33:15,276
I recorded this 16 years ago.

357
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,863
Three days before you were born.

358
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,563
I guess we don't need it anymore.

359
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,190
All right. Do it.

360
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:44,299
I can't gea signal in here.

361
00:34:02,286 --> 00:34:03,559
I'm getting something.

362
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:06,908
It's gonna work.

363
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:09,246
It's happening.
We're gonna get off of this island.

364
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,429
We'll celebrate when we're home.

365
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:18,382
I know you think
you're saving your people,

366
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:20,616
but you need to stop this.

367
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:22,187
It's a mistake.

368
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,118
The mistake was listening to you.

369
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,013
This will be your last chance.

370
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,105
I'm telling you, making that call

371
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:29,848
is the beginning of the end.

372
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,866
I've got it! I've got a signal!

373
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,041
Jack, please!
You don't know what you're doing!

374
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:37,499
I know exactly what I'm doing.

375
00:34:56,722 --> 00:34:57,878
Step back, Jack.

376
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:07,814
What did you do?

377
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,212
What I had to. Now step back.

378
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,524
Stay away from the phone.

379
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:28,328
What are you doing?

380
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,222
I don't want to shoot you.

381
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,713
Do it, John! Shoot him!

382
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:33,128
Do what you need...

383
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:44,367
Please, put the phone down.

384
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:50,541
You're done keeping me on this island.

385
00:35:56,129 --> 00:35:57,129
I will...

386
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:59,909
kill you if I have to.

387
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:01,927
Then do it.

388
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,424
You're not supposed to do this.

389
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,214
<i>Minkowski.</i>

390
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:41,025
Who is this?

391
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,395
<i>Who is this?</i>

392
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,413
My name's Jack shephard.
Are you...

393
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:48,891
Are you on the boat... the freighter?

394
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:50,782
<i>How'd you get this channel?</i>

395
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:53,854
Naomi told us about your search team,

396
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,091
about the boat.

397
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:59,048
<i>Naomi? You found her?
Where is she? Who are you?</i>

398
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:03,585
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

399
00:37:05,842 --> 00:37:07,566
Can you get a fix on our location?

400
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:09,341
<i>Hell, yeah, we can.</i>

401
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:12,080
<i>Sit tight.
We'll be right there.</i>

402
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:16,591
It's me.

403
00:38:18,081 --> 00:38:20,339
Wait. Don't...
Don't hang up, please.

404
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:24,863
I know what you said.
I just...

405
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,115
I just need to see you.

406
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:30,217
Please.

407
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:35,783
Yeah, out at the airport.

408
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:38,654
You know where.

409
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
Thank you.

410
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:06,770
Saw you on the news.

411
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:10,857
Still pulling people
out of burning wreckage, huh?

412
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:12,904
Old habits.

413
00:40:16,953 --> 00:40:18,091
You look terrible.

414
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:21,718
Thanks.

415
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,024
Why did you call me?

416
00:40:37,587 --> 00:40:39,342
I was hoping that you'd heard,

417
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:41,558
that maybe you'd go to the funeral.

418
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,753
Why would I go to the funeral?

419
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,165
Been flying a lot.

420
00:41:03,124 --> 00:41:04,146
What?

421
00:41:04,217 --> 00:41:05,828
The golden pass that they gave us.

422
00:41:06,654 --> 00:41:07,917
I've been using it.

423
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,478
Every friday night, I...

424
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:14,487
I fly from L.A. to Tokyo or...

425
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:19,056
Singapore or... Sydney.

426
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,061
And then I...

427
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:24,468
I get off, and I...

428
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,435
have a drink
and then I fly home.

429
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:30,466
Why?

430
00:41:33,905 --> 00:41:35,641
Because I want it to crash.

431
00:41:39,786 --> 00:41:42,178
I don't care
about anybody else on board.

432
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:46,350
Every little bump we hit or...

433
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:48,331
turbulence, I mean, like,

434
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:51,379
I actually close my eyes,

435
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,181
and I pray

436
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:56,477
that I can get back...

437
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,994
- This is not gonna change...
- No, I'm sick...

438
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:08,844
of lying.

439
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:13,905
We made a mistake.

440
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:21,842
I have to go.

441
00:42:22,654 --> 00:42:24,355
He's gonna be wondering why I'm...

442
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,466
We...

443
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,638
were not supposed to leave.

444
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,467
Yes, we were.

445
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:46,406
Good-bye, Jack.

446
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:56,905
We have to go back, Kate.

447
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:15,969
We have to go back!
