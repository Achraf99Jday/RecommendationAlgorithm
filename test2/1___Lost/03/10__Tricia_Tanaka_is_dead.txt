1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,851
Wash away my troubles

2
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,686
wash away my pain

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,190
with the rain of Shambala

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,317
wash away my sorrow

5
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,277
wash away my shame

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,906
with the rain of Shambala...

7
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,325
You got this thing
running yet, buddy?

8
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:36,119
Nah, but I got your
tools all set.

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,622
See if we can get this
thing started, okay?

10
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:41,120
I thought we needed
a new carburetor.

11
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:43,370
Well, maybe we don't. Come on.

12
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:45,717
Slide behind the wheel.
We'll fire this up.

13
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,055
What's the matter? Go ahead.

14
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,900
This is stupid. Without a new
carburetor, it's not gonna work.

15
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,070
Having hope is never stupid.

16
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,540
You gotta believe good things
will happen, and then they will.

17
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:22,782
Understand what I'm saying?

18
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:26,121
In this world, son,

19
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:30,710
you gotta make your own luck.
All right?

20
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:32,462
All right. Come on.

21
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:39,090
Well, what do you
want to fix today?

22
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:45,182
We're gonna have to put that on hold
for a little while, 'cause, uh,

23
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:49,101
I gotta go to Vegas.
You know, I got some work out there.

24
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,060
What about the road trip?

25
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:54,361
Well, the Grand Canyon will still be
there when I get back, little dude.

26
00:01:55,076 --> 00:01:56,862
Hey, I got something for you.

27
00:01:58,288 --> 00:02:00,872
I'm... not supposed
to mom says.

28
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,992
Live a little, Hugo.
It's just a candy bar, okay?

29
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,331
- All right.
- I'll be back before you know it, all right?

30
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,380
Hold down the fort?

31
00:02:11,595 --> 00:02:12,920
You're my man? All right.

32
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:03,723
So then the Others take the bags off our
heads and we're on the other side of
the island.

33
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:08,600
And they take Jack,
Kate and Sawyer someplace, and

34
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:13,061
they sent me back to warn
everyone to stay away...

35
00:03:13,408 --> 00:03:14,572
which I did...

36
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:18,033
and now everyone's freaked out.

37
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:23,071
With them gone,
and what happened to Eko,

38
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,080
they're all scared...

39
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,502
and I'm scared.

40
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,753
But then I've...

41
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:41,511
been scared most of my
time here, anyway...

44
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,093
Bloody hell.

45
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,802
- Dude, you okay?
- Peachy.

46
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,300
Really? 'Cause you've kinda
been moping the last--

47
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,471
Look, it's not worth talking about,
Hurley, okay?

48
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:29,223
Dude, you can tell me anything.

49
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:35,650
Desmond...

50
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:38,862
said I was gonna die.

51
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:41,533
He told me he has
these flashes...

52
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,033
visions, whatever...

53
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,453
and in them, I always die.

54
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:53,961
So this is the part
where you tell me,

55
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:57,920
"it's ridiculous.
Don't be daft. He's a nutter."

56
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,301
I think he might be right...

57
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,590
and I think it
might be my fault.

58
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,342
Your fault?

59
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,722
I'm... kinda cursed.

60
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:12,101
Death finds me, dude.

61
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,232
Vincent?

62
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:23,441
Is that an arm?

63
00:05:29,585 --> 00:05:31,910
Here, Vincent.
Come here, Vincent.

64
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,701
I think we need to get that.

65
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,332
Yeah, chase the dog with the
skeletal arm into the creepy jungle.

66
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:39,253
- You be my guest.
- Uh, okay.

67
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:42,170
If I'm not back in three hours,
tell somebody.

68
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,512
Vincent!

69
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:53,893
Vincent, come here!

70
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,453
Vincent!

71
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:35,473
Vincent.

72
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:53,701
Awesome.

73
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:03,001

74
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,390
It's everyone's fantasy--
winning the lottery--

75
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:16,851
untold millions falling
into your lap overnight.

76
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,140
What would you do
with all that money?

77
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:23,650
Well, one such lucky winner
recently bought a chicken shack.

78
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,070
I'm Tricia Tanaka
with Hugo Heyes,

79
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:29,861
winner of a record $114 million, outside
mr. Cluck's chicken shack in
Diamond Bar,

80
00:07:29,956 --> 00:07:35,780
which will be having its
grand reopening tomorrow.

81
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:39,502
So, Hugo, I think the question
on everyone's mind is

82
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,960
why did you buy Mr. Cluck's?

83
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:42,920
Uh...

84
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,503
I like chicken.

85
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:56,602
Um, also with us is, uh, Hugo's former
boss and now employee, Randy Nations.

86
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,940
That's probably every working
stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes?

87
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,780
So, Hugo, tell us what else you've done
since you got on your lucky streak.

88
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,070
Actually, I've kind of
had some bad luck, too.

89
00:08:13,246 --> 00:08:16,332
My, uh,
grandpa Tito died of a heart attack,

90
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:19,081
and the first house I
bought my mom burnt down.

91
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,833
My friend Johnny ran off
with my girlfriend Starla...

92
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:24,712
oh, and this guy jumped
off my accountant's roof.

93
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,502
Cut.

94
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,001
What the hell was that?

95
00:08:29,595 --> 00:08:32,840
It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes.
Do you know what that is?

96
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:34,383
Yeah.

97
00:08:35,596 --> 00:08:37,221
Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.

98
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:41,812
Um, uh, do you mind if we go inside and,
uh, shoot some B-roll?

99
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,912
- Oh, I don't know...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can.

100
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:48,191
Oh, he's just superstitious.
You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.

101
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:50,230
Okay, let's go.

102
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:54,322
Ugh! God, I hate this.
I always get the stupid stories.

103
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,412
- Hey, you sure it's okay?
- Yeah, relax.

104
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,742
The safety guards
are on the fryers?

105
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,912
Dude, those fryers are stone-cold.
All right?

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,713
We don't even start
cooking till tomorrow.

107
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,122
You hear something?

108
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,043
And then pan through the--

109
00:09:57,846 --> 00:10:00,351
Well, we are out of
Dharma oat bars.

110
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,510
- Already?
- Yep.

111
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,562
Did you check behind
the powdered milk?

112
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:07,442
Will you pass me
the box of cereal?

113
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:13,823
Will you... pass me...
the cereal?

114
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:19,203
From now on,
I will only speak to you in English.

115
00:10:19,367 --> 00:10:21,202
It's how you will learn.

116
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:25,332
It will be hard at first...

117
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:27,871
Hey! Hey!

118
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,383
Hey, everyone, hey!

119
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:31,883
Hurley, what is it?

120
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:33,423
Is it the Others?

121
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,711
- Are you okay?
- What's going on, man?

122
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,171
Car.

123
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:39,930
I found a car...

124
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:41,971
tipped over in the jungle.

125
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,600
You found a... car.

126
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,482
And we can totally fix it
and get it going again.

127
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:49,310
It's not far. Come on.

128
00:10:49,905 --> 00:10:51,811
Why do we need to start a car?

129
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,440
Because it'll be fun.

130
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:57,032
Oh.

131
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,820
We could all use some fun.

132
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:02,030
I mean, after everything
that's happened, we need it.

133
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,662
Especially you, dude.

134
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,252
So who's with me?

135
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,382
Well, I...
gotta get some bananas. Sorry.

136
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,172
I don't think so, Hurley.

137
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:22,343
Come on! Anyone?
We're gonna drive it!

138
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,180
Who's coming?

139
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,400
Thanks, dude.

140
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:42,700
You have no idea what you
volunteered for, do you?

141
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,491
Come on.

142
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:48,081
Are we there yet?

143
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:52,000
If we are where I think we are,

144
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,670
then our beach should be
just through those trees.

145
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:56,507
We'll be home in
about five minutes.

146
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,715
Try to contain your
excitement, freckles.

147
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,343
Forgive me if I'm not
excited about explaining

148
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:04,053
why there's only two of
us coming back, James.

149
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,142
Well, maybe they should explain
why they ain't come looking for us.

150
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,892
In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke--
ow! Aah!

151
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,400
- What happened?
- Stepped on something. Son of a bitch!

152
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:17,153
Here, let me see.
Looks like a... Sart.

153
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,782
How the hell did
it get out here?

154
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,712
All right,
just relax your foot for a second, okay?

155
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,992
I'm gonna pull it out on the
count of three. You ready?

156
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:24,452
One...

157
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:27,162
Ow! I thought you said three.

158
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:30,370
Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst
part. I thought I would spare you.

159
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:44,892
You know,
all you have to do is say sorry.

160
00:12:45,145 --> 00:12:48,762
We could start again,
give each other a clean slate.

161
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,941
A clean slate...
Like on "little house"?

162
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:56,062
- What?
- "Little house on the prairie"?

163
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:59,040
Laura Ingalls used to write on
this little chalkboard at school?

164
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:01,031
You call it "Little house"?

165
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:05,572
I had mono when I was a kid.
I missed two months of school.

166
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,742
We only got one
channel in my trailer.

167
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,581
What are we even talking about?

168
00:13:16,676 --> 00:13:19,041
Ah, we ain't talking
about nothing.

169
00:13:20,305 --> 00:13:24,550
- James...
- and I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

170
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:28,603
So that's how it's gonna be?

171
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,893
Welcome home, Sawyer.

172
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:40,983
Welcome home, Kate.

173
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,710
Hugo?

174
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,501
Is that you, Hugo?

175
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,473
Oh, my God.

176
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:48,511
What happened?

177
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:51,052
- Tricia Tanaka's dead.
- What?

178
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,011
Mr. Cluck's...
it got hit by a meteor...

179
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,183
or an asteroid...

180
00:14:57,106 --> 00:15:00,851
I don't know the difference,
but it's gone.

181
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,023
- That's crazy.
- It's not crazy.

182
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:04,401
It's the lottery money.

183
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,152
The numbers--I'm cursed.
And now Tricia Tanaka's dead,

184
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,952
and her camera dude,
and it's all my fault.

185
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:13,200
- It was an accident.
- It's not an accident.

186
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:16,251
It is a curse.
There's only one way to stop it.

187
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,661
- I have to go to Australia.
- Again with Australia?

188
00:15:18,838 --> 00:15:20,871
That's where the
numbers came from.

189
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,382
Lenny in the institution--

190
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,380
he told me.

191
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,420
Hugo, Hugo, wait.

192
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:29,050
I can prove to you
you're not cursed.

193
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:31,683
- You can?
- Yes.

194
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:35,763
Come here with me.
I have to show you something.

195
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:39,812
Hey, Hugo!

196
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,110
After 17 years,
your father has returned.

197
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:53,952
Hey, wow. Your mom wasn't
kidding about those candy bars.

198
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,492
Just kidding.

199
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,670
Poor...

200
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:03,923
Roger.

201
00:16:06,427 --> 00:16:08,381
Sorry about your arm, dude.

202
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:12,341
Hurley!

203
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,012
In. In.

204
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:19,312
Totally. Let's check it out.

205
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:28,732
Dude, Roger was on a beer run.

206
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:35,490
Oh, man, I suck at charades.
You want to what?

207
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:42,041
Oh, you wanna take Roger out...

208
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,082
then and turn it over? Cool.

209
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:46,212
I understand!

210
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,930
Okay, on three.

211
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,260
One...

212
00:16:58,607 --> 00:16:59,393
two...

213
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,102
three.

214
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,860
We'll get that later.

215
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:23,873
So when's it gonna happen?

216
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,422
When's what gonna happen?

217
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:31,170
Don't play stupid
with me... brother.

218
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,012
I was drunk.
You know, if I said anything--

219
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,260
I have a right to know
when I'm gonna die.

220
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,693
- It doesn't work like that.
- What doesn't work like that?

221
00:17:44,948 --> 00:17:46,233
Hey, Oliver Twist.

222
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,770
Where the hell's my stuff?

223
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:52,281
- What stuff?
- Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff.

224
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:56,150
I had books, food, porno,
a bottle of scotch.

225
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,322
Aye, apologies for
the scotch, mate.

226
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:01,451
You drank it?!

227
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,750
Well, to be fair, there was, uh...
there was three of us.

228
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:08,003
Yeah, there was.

229
00:18:08,216 --> 00:18:09,961
You, the Munchkin and who else?

230
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:18,681
Oh, I got it.

231
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:20,551
We're gonna tip it up.

232
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,723
Crafty.

233
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:23,560
Crafty?

234
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:27,023
Yeah, crafty. It's like...

235
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:30,061
when you're good at... crafts.

236
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,233
Never mind.

237
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,651
Hey, where the hell's my stuff?

238
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,740
- What are y'all doing?
- Dude! You're alive!

239
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:43,951
- Alive!
- Yeah, yeah, snuffy.

240
00:18:44,085 --> 00:18:46,042
It's good to see you, too.

241
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,920
I'll be damned.
Y'all found yourselves a hippie car.

242
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:50,001
Pretty cool, huh?

243
00:18:50,256 --> 00:18:51,672
- Sawyer.
- Jin-bo.

244
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:56,590
- How you doing?
- Good... see you.

245
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,972
Well, look at that.
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

246
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,643
What about Jack and Kate?

247
00:19:01,856 --> 00:19:03,223
They with you? They all right?

248
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,723
Kate's with me...

249
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,352
but the doc...

250
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,560
they still got him.

251
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:10,481
Okay, it's okay.

252
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,613
It's gonna be all right.
Jack's gonna be all right. We all are.

253
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,230
Well, what a relief.

254
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,842
Nah, see,
things are getting better.

255
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:20,031
The car, you coming back safely--
it's a sign.

256
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,242
Yeah, a sign I want
my stuff back.

257
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,412
Unh-unh. You're gonna
help us fix this thing.

258
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,253
And why in the hell
would I do that?

259
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:30,462
'Cause there's beer.

260
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:34,502
Why did he say,
"don't come back"?

261
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,590
He sacrificed himself
so we could escape.

262
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,352
Probably didn't want
it to be for nothing.

263
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:41,302
Hurley told us they
released Michael and Walt.

264
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,763
Yep. They gave Michael a boat.

265
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:45,600
They took off and
never looked back.

266
00:19:45,605 --> 00:19:46,891
Did you see any other boats?

267
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:50,523
No, but something tells me they
didn't give away their only one.

268
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,940
- So they can leave the island?
- I don't know, John.

269
00:19:56,366 --> 00:20:00,112
This "zoo" where they held you--
is that where they live?

270
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,781
We escaped with one of them--
a kid named Karl.

271
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,661
He said that they
live on this island.

272
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,120
He could've taken us there,
but Sawyer let him go.

273
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,203
Why?

274
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,873
You're gonna have
to ask Sawyer.

275
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,463
- Kate, where are you going?
- I don't care what Jack said.

276
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:19,170
They've got him, and we have to
get him back. I owe him that...

277
00:20:19,387 --> 00:20:21,221
so I'm going to get help.

278
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:23,261
Help from who?

279
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:31,732
Now that's a hell of a Jesus.

280
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,690
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.

281
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,273
He knows of my love
for the Savior,

282
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,942
so he commissioned
artisans in Taxco

283
00:20:40,077 --> 00:20:43,912
to custom carve for me
this statue in solid gold.

284
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,660
Wow, that smells
like great lasagna.

285
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,331
The Trons made it themselves.

286
00:20:51,546 --> 00:20:54,003
Hugo found them in Bennigan's.

287
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,502
Now they are our butlers.

288
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,800
Something wrong, Hugo?

289
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:03,973
Your father asked
you a question, Hugo.

290
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:05,972
My father?

291
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,063
You're acting like
he never left us,

292
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,313
like he hasn't been
gone for 17 years.

293
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:12,760
And all of a sudden
he shows up?

294
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:14,902
Aren't you at least
a little suspicious?

295
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,321
I showed up because your mom called
and said you were in trouble.

296
00:21:18,615 --> 00:21:19,362
What?!

297
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:22,152
All these numbers and curses.

298
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:24,151
Hugo, I don't know
what to do anymore.

299
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:26,530
I thought you needed
a manly influence,

300
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,333
a father to get you to
stop this nonsense.

301
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:30,491
I'm not crazy!

302
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,083
And the only reason he's back

303
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,790
is 'cause he wants the money.

304
00:21:34,008 --> 00:21:35,001
Oh, now that hurts.

305
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,960
Well, guess what?
There isn't gonna be any money. Ha!

306
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:40,250
Mr. Tron, lady Tron.

307
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:42,171
Your services will
no longer be needed.

308
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:43,972
Severance.

309
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,681
Trust me,
I'm doing you a huge favor.

310
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,470
It's only a matter of time
before the curse gets you,

311
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,643
and you... die, or worse.

312
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:53,143
Hugo, what are you doing?

313
00:21:53,315 --> 00:21:54,812
Getting rid of it, all of it--

314
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,600
the money, the houses,
the livestock--

315
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:58,772
and I'm starting with him.

316
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,820
No, Hugo.
Your father is staying with us.

317
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,153
Staying with us? Where?

318
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:06,032
It's been 17 years, Hugo.

319
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:07,533
What's been 17 years?

320
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:15,120
I have needs.

321
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:21,461
No, no, no!
This can't be happening!

322
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:23,882
He has to go! He has to!
I want him gone!

323
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:25,720
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

324
00:22:25,885 --> 00:22:29,260
Why don't you show your father
what you have in the garage, Hugo?

325
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:43,440
I can't believe it.

326
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,653
You saved it.

327
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:51,201
Tou saved it.

328
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:13,813
Me first now. Come on.

329
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,982
What's up with all
this recycling?

330
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:18,600
You got me, dude.

331
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:25,941
Looks like those Dharma freaks were
building some sort of dirt road.

332
00:23:26,745 --> 00:23:29,280
Whoo! Ha ha! Now we're talkin'.

333
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:30,410
Hugo...

334
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:34,990
Looks good to me.

335
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,450
Engine's fine, right?

336
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,120
Son of a--
what's a head doing back here?

337
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:41,961
Oh, that's just Roger.

338
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:45,923
I'm gonna start the car now!

339
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:50,302
Engine...

340
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,513
dude, even if you were
speaking english,

341
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:55,512
I wouldn't understand
a word you're saying.

342
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,890
Just relax. We're good.
This'll work.

343
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,521
I have hope.

344
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:06,690
This will work.

345
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,412
Damn it.

346
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:30,593
Ooh. It's flat, and it stinks.

347
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:33,222
Can you get it to work?
Do you know what's wrong?

348
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:34,892
Chill out.
Let the man do his thing.

349
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:38,273
Dude, that beer's been sitting
there since before "Rocky III,"

350
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:41,310
maybe even "II." It's
probably poison by now.

351
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:43,401
Skeletor seems to like it.

352
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:44,481
Bottoms up.

353
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:45,771
That's not cool, dude.

354
00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:49,442
That guy had a mom,
a family and friends.

355
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:53,203
Oh, and a name. Not Skeletor--
it's Roger Workman.

356
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:58,163
It's work man, you blockhead.
That's his job.

357
00:24:58,338 --> 00:24:59,911
He was a Dharma janitor.

358
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,213
Yeah, well you should
still respect the dead.

359
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:07,463
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you fix it?

360
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:10,382
No. No fix.

361
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,430
But you have to.

362
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:19,473
I mean, can't you try, dude?
I mean, we gotta get this running.

363
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:22,890
Hey, leave the man alone.
He's right. "No fix."

364
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:25,812
Take a look at that mess.
There's no way it's gonna get running.

365
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,323
- How thick are you?
- What's your problem, man?

366
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,321
Why don't you want
this to work?

367
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,993
I don't care if it works.
Why is it so important to you?

368
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,782
Because we could all
use a little hope.

369
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,492
If it's hope you're
looking for, ese,

370
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:38,080
you're on the wrong
damn island...

371
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:41,372
'Cause there sure as
hell ain't no hope here.

372
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,973
Come on, Hugo, time to get up.
Come on! Rise and shine.

373
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:59,352
Hit the deck. Come on,
we're burning daylight. Let's go.

374
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:06,020
- What's with the earphones?
- It's for the noise.

375
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:09,482
Oh, well,
your mother's a very passionate woman.

376
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:11,320
That is disgusting.

377
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,360
Come on. We're going on an adventure.
Let's go.

378
00:26:13,495 --> 00:26:15,200
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

379
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,663
Look, just do this
one thing with me.

380
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:22,162
If it doesn't work, you can go to
Australia. I won't stop you. Okay?

381
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:25,212
What one thing?

382
00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,252
We're gonna break the curse.

383
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,760
- This is stupid.
- Just give her a chance, man.

384
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,260
Cut the deck, please.

385
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,812
You've recently come into
a great deal of money.

386
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,613
Could've seen that on the news.

387
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,622
But it hasn't brought
you happiness.

388
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:03,123
No, it's brought you
great misfortune.

389
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:07,001
Hmm. She didn't see
that on the news.

390
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,962
I'm seeing numbers.

391
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:10,883
What numbers?

392
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:18,013
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

393
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:23,432
There's darkness around
these numbers...

394
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:25,771
great tragedy.

395
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,771
I'm... I'm sorry.

396
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:35,730
What? What is it?

397
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,400
Death...

398
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,450
surrounds you...

399
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:44,871
and more is coming.

400
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,213
Your hands, please.

401
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,791
There's a curse on you...

402
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:56,380
but it can be removed.

403
00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:02,851
Now, Hugo,
I need you to remove your clothes.

404
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:06,972
My clothes?

405
00:28:07,397 --> 00:28:11,060
A curse is like an unwelcome
entity that lives inside you,

406
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:15,401
and it must be exorcised.

407
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,410
Did my dad put you up to this?

408
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,291
- What?
- Hugo, please.

409
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,503
I'll give you $1,000 right now

410
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:33,670
if you admit that my dad
told you to say this stuff.

411
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:37,093
The mystic arts are not subject
to bribes. How dare you--

412
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,340
- $10,000.
- Your dad put me up to it.

413
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,430
I was just trying to help.

414
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:52,732
Help who?

415
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:02,072
Beer.

416
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:04,782
Beer.

417
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:07,701
Bingo. Beautiful.

418
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,331
Car.

419
00:29:11,915 --> 00:29:13,170
Car.

420
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:15,331
Okay.

421
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:18,212
International house
of pancakes.

422
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,170
What are you doing over there?

423
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,511
- I'm praying.
- Praying for what?

424
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:27,100
Help.

425
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:30,181
Well, hell,
I got you a little help right here.

426
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:43,150
Dude!

427
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,113
Hey, dude.
Stop moping. Come on.

428
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,453
I'm not moping. I'm thinking.

429
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:53,413
Unh-unh. When people stare out at
the ocean and get all quiet-like,

430
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:54,503
they're moping.

431
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,122
So get up and come with me.

432
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:57,501
That car I found--

433
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,791
we're getting it running.

434
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,592
What's the point?

435
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,971
- Ow! What did you do that for?
- Snap out of it.

436
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,930
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
'cause someone said you're gonna die.

437
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:10,931
I got an idea that's
gonna help us both.

438
00:30:10,856 --> 00:30:11,853
Now...

439
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:13,521
it is dangerous,

440
00:30:14,317 --> 00:30:17,020
and there's a very good
chance that you will die.

441
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,523
This is supposed to convince
me to come with you?

442
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:22,071
It is, 'cause if you don't die,

443
00:30:22,577 --> 00:30:23,780
then we win.

444
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:24,862
Win?

445
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:26,663
Look, I don't know about you,

446
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:29,120
but things have really
sucked for me lately,

447
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:30,740
and I could really
use a victory.

448
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,740
So let's get one, dude.

449
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,122
Let's get this car started.

450
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,790
Let's look death in the face and say,
"whatever, man."

451
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:38,172
Let's make our own luck.

452
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:39,633
What do you say?

453
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:46,550
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:50,850
I'm sorry.

455
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:54,181
Okay, nice. Keep it coming.

456
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:59,773
Uh... you... were... right.

457
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:04,032
Okay. That's two. Hit me.

458
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:11,161
Those pants don't
make you look fat.

459
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:16,500
Now you got it-- the only three
things a woman needs to hear.

460
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,881
Come on, get up.
We got work to do.

461
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:22,003
What's your problem, Jumbotron?

462
00:31:22,218 --> 00:31:24,053
Shut up, red...

463
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,462
neck... man.

464
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,130
Touche.

465
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:31,551
What's Jiminy
Cricket doing here?

466
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:34,143
- We need another man.
- Another man for what?

467
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,891
To push this car, dude.

468
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:37,642
Push it? Push it where?

469
00:31:39,358 --> 00:31:41,063
Hey! Aah!

470
00:31:42,488 --> 00:31:46,532
Go, go, go, go.

471
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,563
Oh, this is gonna be real good.

472
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,863
So you're going to
Australia, huh?

473
00:32:29,326 --> 00:32:31,860
Long way to go 'cause
some stupid numbers--

474
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,662
I'd really like you to leave.

475
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:37,373
When your mom called
me about the lottery,

476
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,581
I was on my bike before she
could hang the phone up.

477
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:44,131
I'm getting old.

478
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:47,550
Yeah, I saw my retirement.

479
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:51,722
You're right.

480
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,012
I'm here for the money.

481
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,021
Well, you're not
getting any of it.

482
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:02,271
Well, that's not why I'm
here talking to you now.

483
00:33:03,195 --> 00:33:07,901
I'm here talking to you now because
going to Australia's not gonna break
any curse.

484
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:10,281
You don't need to leave.

485
00:33:10,578 --> 00:33:15,200
You just...
you need a little hope.

486
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,793
We make our own luck, Hugo.

487
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,121
You know what I
think you should do?

488
00:33:23,256 --> 00:33:24,081
What?

489
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:28,423
I think you should
give away the money--

490
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:30,172
all of it, every penny.

491
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,760
Just save enough for a...

492
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:35,430
a carburetor.

493
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,101
Work on the Camaro,

494
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,143
you know, just you and me.

495
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:47,150
Take it off the blocks and make
that road trip to the Grand Canyon.

496
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:53,362
Never too late
for a fresh start.

497
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,043
I'll send you a
postcard from Sydney.

498
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:10,593
Hey...

499
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,881
I'll be here when you get back.

500
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:24,390
Are you nuts?
You're not gonna drive down that.

501
00:34:24,777 --> 00:34:27,022
We're gonna jump-start it.

502
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,293
You guys are gonna push it,
and then on the way down,

503
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:32,083
I'm gonna pop the clutch
and get it started.

504
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:33,862
You see those rocks?

505
00:34:34,156 --> 00:34:37,112
All you're gonna do is
crash into those real fast,

506
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:38,703
if you don't roll over first.

507
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,411
Hurley, no.

508
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:42,292
Dudes, I know how to drive.

509
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,173
Now come on. Just push me.
This will work. I know it.

510
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,251
And what are you out here for--
watch him crash and burn?

511
00:34:54,727 --> 00:34:56,973
I came to ride shotgun.

512
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,890
Well, it's your funeral.

513
00:35:07,445 --> 00:35:10,272
Come on.
Let's give 'em their ride.

514
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,680
Are you sure you
want to do this?

515
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,951
Victory or death.

516
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:27,872
Push!

517
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,271
- Whoa, jeez!
- Careful now.

518
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,830
Now would be a
good time, Hurley.

519
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,630
Like right now!

520
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:12,882
There is no curse.

521
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:14,341
You make your own luck.

522
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:16,051
You make your own luck.

523
00:36:16,266 --> 00:36:17,382
There is no curse!

524
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:46,952
Son of a bitch.

525
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,463
On the road to Shambala

526
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,461
everyone is lucky,

527
00:36:54,677 --> 00:36:56,340
everyone is so kind

528
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:59,882
on the road to shambala

529
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:07,011
Come on, come on!

530
00:37:10,275 --> 00:37:12,483
Get in here.

531
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:16,323
All right, come on!

532
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:22,031
How does your light shine
in the halls of Shambala?

533
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:30,081
How does your light shine
in the halls of Shambala?

534
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:11,450
Kate, if you were looking
for help to find Jack,

535
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,083
why didn't you ask us?

536
00:40:13,338 --> 00:40:14,121
Two reasons--

537
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,581
you don't know where to look,
and you're not motivated.

538
00:40:16,797 --> 00:40:18,041
And I don't blame you.

539
00:40:18,297 --> 00:40:20,962
Why would you want to go on
another trek across the island,

540
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,042
risk more lives just
to get Jack back?

541
00:40:23,096 --> 00:40:24,001
You're wrong.

542
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,050
Oh, really?
Then why didn't you come after--

543
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:28,450
Not about the motivation,
just about knowing where to look.

544
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:32,012
We got a compass bearing,
and I'm pretty sure if we follow it,

545
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,853
it'll lead us right to him.

546
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:34,763
How?

547
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:39,520
Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr.
Eko's stick when john was burying him.

548
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:44,442
So now you know our secret.
How about you tell us yours?

549
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:48,032
No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

550
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,903
It's all right! It's safe!

551
00:40:51,206 --> 00:40:53,162
We're just here to talk!

552
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,660
You can come out!

553
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:23,652
What are you doing here?

554
00:41:25,198 --> 00:41:27,232
I came to ask for your help.

555
00:41:28,538 --> 00:41:29,942
To do what?

556
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:32,823
I'm heading to
the Others' camp,

557
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,160
and if I'm gonna find it,

558
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:37,161
I need someone who
knows the island.

559
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:40,411
What makes you think I have
an interest in helping you?

560
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,253
Because they had me,

561
00:41:44,507 --> 00:41:46,172
and they would have
never let me go.

562
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:49,093
They probably would've killed
me if I hadn't escaped.

563
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:53,221
And the girl who
helped me escape...

564
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:56,432
she was about 16 years old.

565
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,521
And her name was Alex.

566
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,351
I'm pretty sure that
she's your daughter.

567
00:42:08,446 --> 00:42:13,950
