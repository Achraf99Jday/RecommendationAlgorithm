1
00:00:06,526 --> 00:00:08,707
<i>It's the story that began
with a simple question.</i>

2
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:10,490
Where are we?

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:11,954
<i>But the search for the answer...</i>

4
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:13,078
So what do we do now?

5
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:14,466
<i>was just the beginning.</i>

6
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:17,480
I wanna get off this island
more than anything else in the world.

7
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:18,888
We're all in this together, man.

8
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,237
<i>A mysterious island...</i>

9
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:22,841
They have houses and dormitories
with water and power.

10
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:24,172
<i>A group of strangers...</i>

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,485
Let's trust this guy.

12
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:26,740
<i>fighting for survival.</i>

13
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:28,341
If we can't live together...

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,567
This is our island.

15
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:30,670
We're gonna die alone.

16
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:31,855
<i>And seeking redemption.</i>

17
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,696
I'm on my own journey now.

18
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:35,883
<i>We've been presented
with baffling mysteries...</i>

19
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:37,074
Dad!

20
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,197
<i>and extraordinary revelations.</i>

21
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:40,467
I think we found it.

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,706
<i>But this story is just hitting stride.</i>

23
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,184
Kate, damn it, run!

24
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:47,149
<i>So what better time</i>

25
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>to remember</i>

26
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,574
<i>all that we've learned?</i>

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,386
You can come out!

28
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:55,627
<i>"Lost" producers</i>

29
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:59,101
<i>Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse
are here to shed some light...</i>

30
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,502
Did I give that away?

31
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:01,933
<i>and provide the final word.</i>

32
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:04,514
That is the definitive answer as
to why the plane crashed.

33
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:06,332
Why do you find it
so hard to believe?

34
00:01:06,537 --> 00:01:07,874
Why do you find it so easy?

35
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,545
<i>- So many mysteries...</i>
- She's alive.</i>

36
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,497
- There were no survivors.
<i>- So little time.</i></i>

37
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,630
Charlie, duck!

38
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,471
I want some friggin' answers!

Synchro:
Golgi, Loky

44
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,376
<i>for answers to
the many mystery of Lost.</i>

45
00:01:28,912 --> 00:01:30,355
Do you wanna know a secret?

46
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,361
<i>Tonight we go right to the source.</i>

47
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,143
<i>Sometimes you answer a question,</i>

48
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,301
but another question crops up
as a result of it.

49
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:38,471
So if you reveal that
Locke is in a wheelchair,

50
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:41,061
the question then becomes,
"how did he get in the wheelchair?"

51
00:01:41,107 --> 00:01:43,691
<i>I think it's a lot like life. Mean,
you march forward and get answers</i>

52
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,748
<i>to certain issues and
certain questions in your life,</i>

53
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,387
but new ones always arise,
and I think that

54
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:48,986
that's what we really try
to do on the show.

55
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,338
The show never becomes
completely vacant of mystery,

56
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,631
because it's a mystery show.

57
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:55,585
That's part of the DNA of "Lost,"
and we embrace it.

58
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:57,688
You'd think they would've come by now.

59
00:01:58,773 --> 00:01:59,798
Who?

60
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:00,959
Anyone.

61
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:03,939
<i>The plane crashes. They...
They're on this island for many days.</i>

62
00:02:04,072 --> 00:02:06,539
<i>No rescue comes.
No one shows up.</i>

63
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:08,833
<i>The characters don't know
anything about each other.</i>

64
00:02:08,908 --> 00:02:11,031
<i>If you were on an airplane,
and it crashed,</i>

65
00:02:11,268 --> 00:02:14,232
<i>you wouldn't know anything
about the guy who was in 16C.</i>

66
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:16,576
So first plane crash?

67
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:19,787
- What gave it away?
- I can always spot the newbies.

68
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,291
I don't know your name.

69
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:24,406
I'm Kate.

70
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,936
The show has been sort of an exploration
into these characters' pasts.

71
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,138
They're mysterious
in addition to the island,

72
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,942
<i>and so little things like
"what did Kate do?" or</i>

73
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:36,118
<i>"why did Sayid torture somebody?" or
"how did Jack get his tattoos?"...</i>

74
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:38,450
<i>Those are mysteries
that have been slow going</i>

75
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:39,976
<i>because they don't like
to talk about it.</i>

76
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,445
We learned that Jack is a doctor.

77
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,506
<i>We come to learn that
he was a spinal surgeon.</i>

78
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:45,930
<i>We know that Jack had
a lot of issues with his father.</i>

79
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,104
How many drinks did you have
at lunch, dad?

80
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:50,397
<i>We know that his wife
was someone who...</i>

81
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,370
<i>She had been in a car crash
and had a bad spinal injury.</i>

82
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:54,471
It's okay.

83
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,991
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.

84
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:59,448
<i>He believes that
this is an impossible surgery,</i>

85
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,125
and the next day,
lo and behold,

86
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,295
<i>he pokes Sarah's foot with a pencil
and it... and it wiggles.</i>

87
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,186
Can you feel this?

88
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,603
<i>So he has to believe in some way,
that this is his destiny,</i>

89
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:12,322
but then when that marriage
begins to come apart at the seams...

90
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,976
- Wait a minute.
<i>- Maybe...</i>

91
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:15,644
<i>there was purpose behind this.</i>

92
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,048
Look at the bright side.

93
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,750
Now you have something to fix.

94
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,150
<i>He holds himself
to a very high standard.</i>

95
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:25,495
<i>He's insecure in many ways, although,
at he same time, he's a great hero.</i>

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,293
Everything's gonna be okay.

97
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,003
We're gonna stay
here tonight, okay? Together.

98
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,685
You did a good thing...

99
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:33,535
Taking care of everybody and...

100
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:35,671
just giving them something to count on.

101
00:03:36,046 --> 00:03:37,970
Kate was a fugitive
before she came the island.

102
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,071
She still is a fugitive.

103
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,729
- She is still a fugitive.
- Once a fugitive, always a fugitive.

104
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,721
<i>A lot in the pilot is made up
of these handcuffs that Walt finds,</i>

105
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,324
<i>leading to the ultimate reveal that
somebody on the plane was a fugitive.</i>

106
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,784
<i>We reveal by the end
of the pilot that it's Kate.</i>

107
00:03:50,843 --> 00:03:52,944
Katherine, what did you do?

108
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:54,188
I took care of you, ma.

109
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:01,055
She actually blew up a house
containing her stepfather,

110
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,572
<i>and there is a US Marshal
who's been chasing her.</i>

111
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,535
Kate Austen,
you're under arrest for murder.

112
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,318
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

113
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:09,523
He's taking her on the plane back to

114
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:12,378
<i>the United States, and that's really
where the story begins.</i>

115
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:15,200
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you're worried about me, Jack.

116
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,317
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you have a problem

117
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,100
staying in one place
for very long, Kate.

118
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,755
<i>So here she is,
stuck on this island,</i>

119
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:23,055
<i>which sort of forces her
into very tricky relationships,</i>

120
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,897
<i>especially when it comes
to Jack and Sawyer.</i>

121
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,276
How about you come a little closer?
Warm me up?

122
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,737
You sure know how to make
a girl feel special, Sawyer.

123
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:36,062
Guys, this isn't just a bear.

124
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:37,472
It's a polar bear.

125
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,084
<i>The sort of practical questions,</i>

126
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,375
we really do try to answer.

127
00:04:40,473 --> 00:04:42,238
I mean, right at
the beginning of the show,

128
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,045
I don't think anyone
expected us to meet

129
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:46,334
<i>with the person who
send out the mysterious signal.</i>

130
00:04:47,275 --> 00:04:48,289
We've got a bar!

131
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:51,951
It's french! The rescue party.
It has to be.

132
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,959
Please, someone come.

133
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,411
The Others... They...

134
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,478
They're dead.

135
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,636
It's a loop.

136
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,071
It's a distress call.

137
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,108
It's been playing
over and over for 16 years.

138
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,929
Guys, where are we?

139
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:10,344
<i>Charlie looked around and realized,</i>

140
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,648
you know, this might not be
a regular island. He said,

141
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:14,307
<i>you know, "guys, where are we?"</i>

142
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,689
I found a wire on the beach.

143
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,345
I thought it might have
something to do with

144
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,779
the transmission
we picked up on the receiver,

145
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,335
with a french woman repeating
on a loop for 16 years.

146
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,023
Has it really been that long?

147
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,669
There's a woman named
Danielle Rousseau on the island.

148
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:32,146
<i>She was on some sort
of a research vessel.</i>

149
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,738
It crashed. Her crew died,

150
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,563
<i>and she's been sort of
wandering around this island.</i>

151
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,966
Your distress signal... you said,

152
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:41,609
"It killed them all."

153
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,791
Have you seen other people
on this island?

154
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,673
No, but I hear them.

155
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:50,866
Out there in the jungle...
the Others.

156
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:54,367
Listen to me.

157
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,408
We're not alone.

158
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:58,623
<i>The big question out there is...</i>

159
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,470
Where are they?
What is this island?

160
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:02,109
<i>Why can't anybody find them?</i>

161
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,009
<i>Why all these people?
Why were they all brought together?</i>

162
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,042
<i>You know,
what were they doing on the plane?</i>

163
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:10,247
<i>These are kind of the big,
unanswerable questions in this season,</i>

164
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,504
<i>but as we move forward,</i>

165
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,600
<i>stuff that we're very
focused on answering.</i>

166
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:16,365
<i>I think the show is
kind of a giant mosaic, and...</i>

167
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,538
<i>you know, we have
the present, and we have the past,</i>

168
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:21,998
<i>and there is the future,
and by the end of the series,</i>

169
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,955
<i>we will have filled in
all those tiles, and you'll have</i>

170
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,953
<i>not only a sense of who
these characters were, who they are,</i>

171
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,370
<i>but also who they're going to become.</i>

172
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:35,852
<i>By the end, this picture
will form the complete story of "Lost."</i>

173
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,083
<i>This is Lost, the answers.</i>

174
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:42,801
<i>Asking the question,</i>

175
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:46,314
<i>"was the crash of Oceanic 815
a random event?"</i>

176
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:49,139
You think we crashed
on this place by coincidence?

177
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:50,657
Especially this place?

178
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,719
<i>At the center of the show,
there has always been this conflict</i>

179
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,201
between Jack and Locke,
and that...

180
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:57,703
conflict has sort of been rooted
on the axis of empiricism versus faith.

181
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:01,348
- We were brought here for a purpose.
- And who brought us here, John?

182
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,097
The island.

183
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:05,201
<i>You have a guy like Jack,
who's basically saying,</i>

184
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,564
"This is coincidence."

185
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,954
"I was a guy. I got on a plane.
The plane crashed on the island."

186
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:12,036
"The island's weird,
but that's not my problem.

187
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,132
"I just want to get off."

188
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,697
I don't believe in destiny.

189
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:16,165
Yes, you do.

190
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:17,703
You just don't know it yet.

191
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,159
And then you've got a guy like Locke,
who basically says,

192
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:22,212
"There must be a purpose,
a design to this."

193
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:24,134
This place is different.

194
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:26,584
<i>He is completely
a believer in the island</i>

195
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,843
<i>and the island's magical
and mysterious powers.</i>

196
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,599
<i>He wants there to be
an explanation, a meaning to all this.</i>

197
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:36,263
<i>But even Locke's faith was not
entirely without reason.</i>

198
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,284
He was paralyzed
before the plane crashed.

199
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,474
Just put me on the bus
right now. I can do this.

200
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:41,734
No, you can't.

201
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,550
You don't know
who you're dealing with!

202
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,409
Don't ever tell me
what I can't do! Ever!

203
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,534
<i>We learned this year</i>

204
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:48,857
exactly how it was that
Locke got in the wheelchair.

205
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,652
This is... awkward.

206
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:53,366
<i>He finds out his father
is this man named Anthony Cooper.</i>

207
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,569
<i>Locke loves this man and
wants to have a relationship with him.</i>

208
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,511
I'm so thankful for you, John.

209
00:07:58,737 --> 00:08:00,427
<i>But this is a big elaborate con.</i>

210
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:02,038
You stole my kidney?

211
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,711
You needed a father figure,
and I needed a kidney.

212
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,971
Get over it.

213
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,104
<i>So he goes and confronts
his father and he says,

214
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,153
"I'm going to expose you.
I'm gonna rat you out."

215
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,725
Phone's right over there, John.

216
00:08:18,055 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>When Locke got to this island,
suddenly he could walk again.

217
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,681
<i>So landing on this island

218
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,256
<i>was the greatest thing ever
to happen in John Locke's life.

219
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:26,091
<i>He becomes sort of the hero

220
00:08:26,316 --> 00:08:29,096
<i>that he always wanted to be
in his former life but never could be.

221
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:32,076
<i>The last thing he wants to do
is ever go back to the outside world.

222
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,473
- I like it here.
- I like it here, too.

223
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:37,273
<i>In fact, Locke's conviction
led him to solve

224
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:40,045
<i>one of the island's
most profound mysteries.

225
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,857
He finds this mysterious hatch

226
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,625
<i>that's buried in the ground,
and he excavates it.

227
00:08:44,878 --> 00:08:46,539
So you want me to go down first?

228
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:48,041
Hell, you're lighter.

229
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,309
<i>One of the biggest questions ever
on the show is, what's in the hatch?

230
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:52,609
What is it?

231
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,340
I think there's something down...

232
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,556
<i>And the answer is Desmond.

233
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,939
Behind you.

234
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:01,812
<i>He was in a solo,
around the world sailing race.

235
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,979
<i>He crashed on the island.
Our gang finally finds him.

236
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:08,650
<i>They discover that this is
the first of a series of hatches

237
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:11,803
<i>that were built on this island
by this mysterious, Dharma Initiative.

238
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:14,506
<i>You and your partner are
currently located in station three,

239
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,863
<i>where scientists could work
to understand the unique

240
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,287
<i>electromagnetic fluctuations
emanating from...

241
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,893
<i>this sector of the island.

242
00:09:21,182 --> 00:09:23,845
<i>The Dharma Initiative was
on this island, back in the...

243
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,464
<i>late 70's and early 80's and they...

244
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,199
<i>built these hatches
all over the island

245
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:29,544
<i>where they conducted
various scientific experiments,

246
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,683
<i>but the most important hatch
was called the swan,

247
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,943
<i>and that's where Desmond
spent three years down there,

248
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,470
<i>pushing this button
every 108 minutes, and...

249
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:39,519
<i>he was told that if he didn't push
that button, the world would end.

250
00:09:39,696 --> 00:09:41,959
<i>One day, he actually adventured
outside of the hatch.

251
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,166
<i>Desmond failed to enter the code
in the computer in the hatch.

252
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,383
<i>As a result, 815 crashes.

253
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:49,980
- When did you come here?
- September, 22nd.

254
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,520
I think I crashed your plane.

255
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:54,022
That is the definitive answer
as to why the plane crashed.

256
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,269
<i>The electromagnetic pulse
shot out of the hatch,

257
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:59,920
<i>fried the instrumentation on the plane.
The plane crashed.

258
00:10:00,586 --> 00:10:02,195
<i>But the crash was not welcome news

259
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,970
<i>to a community of people
already living on the island...

260
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:08,113
<i>A group the survivors would come
to know as the Others.

261
00:10:08,258 --> 00:10:09,258
Goodwin.

262
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,202
You run, you could make
that shore in an hour.

263
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,657
Get up there to that fuselage.

264
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,176
There may actually be survivors.

265
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:16,946
Listen. Learn.
Don't get involved. Go.

266
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:20,717
<i>The Others are a community
of around 30 or 40 people, we think.

267
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:24,025
<i>They do not want</i> anyone
from the outside world to find them.

268
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:25,799
This is not your island.

269
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:27,977
This is our island.

270
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:31,284
<i>Nor are they particularly happy when
new people arrive on the island

271
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,316
<i>- and threaten their privacy.</i>
- Hello there.

272
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:35,391
<i>Now the first guy we meet
is a guy named Ethan.

273
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:38,026
<i>He kidnaps Claire,
does all sorts of nasty things to her.

274
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,065
You're just gonna feel a little pinch.

275
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:42,858
<i>He ends up getting killed
by, uh, Charlie.

276
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:46,114
I wasn't gonna let that animal
anywhere near her again.

277
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:48,068
There is this guy... Richard Alpert.

278
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,356
We're looking

279
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:52,194
for someone to remind us that
we're here for more important reasons.

280
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:54,479
<i>- Then there's mr. Friendly.</i>
- It's a good thing we found you.

281
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,596
He's actually, in some ways,
kind of a nice guy.

282
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,337
I'm not showering in front of you.

283
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:00,620
You're not my type.

284
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,330
<i>He always has something mean to say,

285
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,201
but he makes it sound
as nice as possible.

286
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,160
What kind of people
do you think we are, Jack?

287
00:11:06,242 --> 00:11:09,170
The kind of people that would
hang Charlie from a tree,

288
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:11,229
kidnap children.

289
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:12,627
We're gonna have to take the boy.

290
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,187
Help me, dad!

291
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,091
That's the kind of people
I think you are.

292
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,262
<i>But we do know that
he is a football player.

293
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,478
Based on the way he throws the ball,
I would say he's

294
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,480
- probably, on the defense.
- Not a quarterback.

295
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,359
<i>But Mr. Friendly answers to someone.

296
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,459
My name is Benjamin Linus,

297
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:29,806
and I've lived on this island
all my life.

298
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,465
<i>Ben is the leader of the Others.

299
00:11:32,656 --> 00:11:35,520
<i>He is a very interesting
and complex guy.

300
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,840
You came striding
out of the jungle, John,

301
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:42,087
to make my dream come true.

302
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,520
He's very smart, he's very creepy,

303
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,015
and he's very dangerous.

304
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:50,567
If you want me dead, why don't you
just shoot me and get it over with?

305
00:11:50,704 --> 00:11:53,246
Because we're not killers, james.

306
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:56,137
This conflict between the Others
and our beach survivors

307
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:58,606
has been brewing for
the entire history of the show.

308
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:00,182
They've attacked us,

309
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,407
sabotaged us, abducted us,

310
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:04,235
murdered us!

311
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:08,303
We're not the only people
on this island, and we all know it!

312
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,510
<i>For the survivors of Oceanic flight 815,

313
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,689
That was weird, right?

314
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:22,069
<i>the search for answers
began the very first night.

315
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,595
<i>The first mystery of the island
was when all of a sudden,

316
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:28,545
the trees were moving, and our
characters heard a noise,

317
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,185
<i>and they're wondering what
the heck is going on out there.

318
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:41,299
The first question is, what does
that thing look like? Is it a dinosaur?

319
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,793
<i>Is the monster man-made? We don't know.

320
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,229
Does the monster have some
sort of ability to judge you?

321
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,570
<i>Locke passed it
the first time he saw it,

322
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,550
<i>but then later on,
the monster grabbed him

323
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,756
<i>and tried to pull him into a hole.

324
00:12:55,027 --> 00:12:57,525
And then what does it do with
that judgment is a very sort of

325
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,838
interesting question as
we move forwards on the show.

326
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:01,860
Did you see it, Kate?

327
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:04,930
Then I guess we're both crazy.

328
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,518
Now we've seen what it
looks like on several occasions.

329
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,033
<i>It's this sort of column
of mysterious black smoke.

330
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,779
This season, when
the monster experiences juliet,

331
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:22,800
<i>you see several flashes, almost
as if it's taking pictures of her.

332
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,615
<i>Is the monster a manifestation
of the island? We don't know.

333
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:30,021
We do know that when
it looks at you, it seems to be able

334
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,780
<i>to process certain memories
that you may have had.

335
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:35,563
<i>And some memories
can become quite real.

336
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,057
<i>We have learned, uh,
that the island is...

337
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,880
<i>capable of these apparitions.
You know,

338
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:43,217
<i>Jack can see his dead father.

339
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,261
<i>Walt, who was off, you know,
in some other place,

340
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:48,948
<i>mysteriously appears
for Shannon and Sayid.

341
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,983
<i>Kate sees a horse
that was part of her past.

342
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,689
All these characters
are sort of seeking redemption

343
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,609
<i>for misdeeds of their past.

344
00:13:56,829 --> 00:13:58,537
<i>Sun and Jin are two survivors

345
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,242
<i>who arrived with much to overcome.

346
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:03,385
<i>They came to
the island incredibly estranged.

347
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:06,293
You think we should do something?

348
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:07,878
We've learned that Sun had an affaire

349
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:10,155
<i>when her marriage wasn't
really working out with Jin.

350
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:11,334
What's wrong?

351
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:12,947
What's wrong is i'm married.

352
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:17,019
Once Sun and Jin got to then they
sort of reconciled their relationship.

353
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,767
<i>We reveal in her past

354
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,026
<i>that she had been told
that her and her husband Jin

355
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:25,651
<i>would never be able to
have a baby.

356
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,914
<i>It's Jin who is infertile, not her.

357
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,331
<i>Then we discover that Sun is pregnant.

358
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:32,244
Positive is a positive.

359
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,995
But it's impossible.

360
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:35,757
Oh, no, it's possible.

361
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:38,752
<i>And the big mystery is
whose baby is it?

362
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:41,414
<i>That question was answered one night,

363
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,473
<i>when Sun was brought
to the Dharma medical station.

364
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,368
You got pregnant on the island.

365
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,382
It's Jin's.

366
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,569
<i>These are all people
who need to redeem themselves.

367
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,427
They've made huge
mistakes in their past,

368
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,288
and now that they're on this island...
<i>They get the opportunity to</i>

369
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:02,979
<i>put all those mistakes behind them.

370
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,758
Charlie, I need you to go get jack.

371
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:06,343
I might not know what i'm doing,
but i'll figure it out.

372
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,189
If I can kick drugs,
I can deliver a baby.

373
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,034
Let me explain. I'm a drug addict.

374
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:11,674
I was a drug addict. I'm clean now.

375
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:12,877
Get Jack!

376
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,791
<i>Charlie and Claire have a long and,
complicated history together.

377
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:20,679
Charlie starts out very early on
kind of providing her comfort, and

378
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:23,529
imagining a jar
of peanut butter.

379
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:25,777
Stick to the roof of your mouth.

380
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,313
Extra smooth.

381
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:30,471
<i>He loves her,
and part of her really loves him,

382
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,526
<i>but because Charlie was an addict,

383
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:34,872
Claire isn't entirely sure
she can trust him.

384
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,655
Give them to me.

385
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,392
I'm proud of you, Charlie.

386
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,178
Over time, he has become sort of
the surrogate father for Aaron,

387
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:48,804
her child, and the three of them
kind of comprise

388
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:51,892
the closest thing to a nuclear
family that exists on "lost."

389
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,591
You know i'm not giving
up on you either, Charlie.

390
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:57,489
We'll get through this together.

391
00:15:58,187 --> 00:16:00,960
<i>Our characters really seem
to be able to rise to the occasion

392
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:05,309
and are incredibly heroic
and exhibit qualities

393
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:09,015
that really transcend
the people that they once were.

394
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,824
Who's that?

395
00:16:11,002 --> 00:16:12,279
Her name's Penny.

396
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,756
That's not bad, des, not bad at all.

397
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:19,104
<i>Desmond is a guy who's
had an issue with cowardice.

398
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,824
Desmond, what are you running from?

399
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:23,120
I have to get my honor back.

400
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:27,632
<I<And trying to do the right thing
to be a hero in his life.

401
00:16:27,983 --> 00:16:29,000
I've gotta go,

402
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:32,052
and you've gotta get as far away
from here as possible.

403
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:33,929
<i>System failure.

404
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,570
<I>Desmond's moment of heroism arrived

405
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,476
<I>when he sacrificed himself

406
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,005
<i>to save his new friends.

407
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,978
<i>With the turn of a key,

408
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,774
<i>Desmond destroyed the hatch,

409
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:52,458
<i>releasing the magnetic pressure

410
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,546
<I>and preventing global catastrophe.

411
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,463
<i>And in the process, he may have
provided the outside world

412
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,972
<I>with a clue to the whereabouts
of the island.

413
00:17:03,206 --> 00:17:05,617
<i>For the first time in the show,
we've gone off the island,

414
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:08,350
you find these two guys in
this mysterious snow hut someplace,

415
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,168
<i>that electromagnetic pulse
suddenly makes

416
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,466
<i>the island visible,
and they pick up the telephone,

417
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:14,827
and they call Penny Widmore...
Desmond's girlfriend.

418
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,224
I think we found it.

419
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:20,180
<i>The implication is
the island is hard to find,

420
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,027
and only because of this
extraordinary electromagnetic event,

421
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,471
did it reveal itself
for a moment and was found.

422
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:28,467
<i>That is a big question that
remains hanging over the show.

423
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:31,744
<i>Desmond survived the blast
with a surprising new ability.

424
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:33,290
<i>He starts having these flash.

425
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:38,238
Sort of precognitive visions of things
that are gonna happen in the future.

426
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,332
How'd you know claire was drowning?

427
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,044
You hear the lightning as well?

428
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,416
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,

429
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,712
you were electrocuted,

430
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,601
and when you heard claire
was in the water, you...

431
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,743
You drowned trying to save her.

432
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,752
No matter what I try to do...

433
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:01,610
You're gonna die, Charlie.

434
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,800
Beautiful, isn't it?
No matter how much time

435
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,488
you spend on the island,
you just never get tired of this view.

436
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:08,104
<i>A mysterious place

437
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:10,062
<i>that raises so many questions.

438
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:11,589
What is the history of this island?

439
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:14,465
<i>Why has the island been drawing
people to it all this time?

440
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,614
The place we're
taking you to is special.

441
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:17,999
Special, huh?

442
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:20,699
You'll see things there
that you never imagined.

443
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,089
<i>The Others... Where did
they come from initially?

444
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:25,151
What is their genesis?
<i>We know that the Others</i>

445
00:18:25,348 --> 00:18:28,609
have been able to leave the island.
Go to and from it. They recruit Juliet.

446
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,053
Mind if i ask you something?

447
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,281
Sure.

448
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,233
What do you see?

449
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:36,064
We discovered that Juliet,
in fact, is a very successful

450
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:37,759
fertility research doctor.

451
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,959
Judging from the decomposition
of the endometrium,

452
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:42,432
i would say the the woman
was somewhere in the seventies

453
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,828
- Well, actually, she's 26.
- What happened to her?

454
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:48,209
What if i told you that you could have
complete freedom and money to find out?

455
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:51,450
<i>There's something inside of her
that is really intrigued by this offer..

456
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,572
We're here.

457
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:55,516
And they actually take Juliet
to the island and

458
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,474
basically install her their
resident expert on fertility.

459
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,363
My name is Benjamin Linus.

460
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:02,839
I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

461
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,376
<i>Her job there is to try to see
whether she can find out</i>

462
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:07,502
<i>why pregnant women
on the island are dying.</i>

463
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,226
I think it happens at conception.

464
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,584
There's nothing I can do about it,
at least not here.

465
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,161
- Not sure I understand.
- The only way to see if I'm right

466
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,048
- is to take a woman off the island.
- No, you're not taking anybody

467
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,223
off the island.

468
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,096
<i>Juliet, at a certain point,
really becomes</i>

469
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,231
aware that Ben is manipulating her, and
all she wants is to get off this island.

470
00:19:24,477 --> 00:19:26,624
That's not our agreement.
You need to stay here

471
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,818
- until your work is finished.
- It's impossible!

472
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,080
- The mothers keep dying.
- Then we'll find more mothers.

473
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,048
<i>We learned that Ben is sick.</i>

474
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,044
You're problem is a large tumor
surrounding your L4 vertebrae.

475
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,376
<i>And right about then,</i>

476
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,313
<i>our survivors have sort of entered
the world of the Others.</i>

477
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,451
Did you see it?

478
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,517
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

479
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,957
- Of course we saw it.
- <i>When Oceanic 815 crashes,</i>

480
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,599
<i>Ben's got live footage of the plane,
and the crash news has already hit.</i>

481
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,427
I want detailed files on
every single passenger.

482
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,118
<i>Those files revealed
there was a surgeon on board.</i>

483
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,457
- Hello again.
- <i>Jack and his friends were captured</i>

484
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:06,835
<i>and taken to an abandoned Dharma Station
where polar bears were once kept.</i>

485
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,250
The Dharma Initiative was doing
research on polar bears.

486
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,319
They had them in cages.
They obviously escaped.

487
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,147
They're roaming free.

488
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,630
Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit.

489
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,435
- I figured out your complicated gizmo.
- Only took the bears two hours.

490
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,622
How many of 'em were there?

491
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,558
- Jack is being asked to do the surgery.
- You need to be in surgery yesterday.

492
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,967
All right, then.
Whatever you need, it's yours.

493
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,420
No, I think you misunderstood me.
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

494
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,362
I just wanted you to understand
how you're gonna die.

495
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:39,336
<i>And Kate is being told that if Jack
doesn't do the surgery,</i>

496
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,516
- <i>that Sawyer will be killed.</i>
- You have to do it.

497
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,960
- What?
- They're gonna kill Sawyer!

498
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,037
One of the big questions
that arises on the show

499
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,351
<i>is who's Kate gonna choose...
Jack or Sawyer.</i>

500
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,121
<i>I guess the question was more,
who is Kate gonna sleep with first?</i>

501
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,071
And we answered that question.

502
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,252
<i>Jack now sees this happen.
It's this sort of heartbreaking moment.</i>

503
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,347
<i>He sees Kate has, in fact,
chosen Sawyer.</i>

504
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,386
<i>Instead of getting angry,
he actually decides to rescue them.</i>

505
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,054
Jack begins the surgery,
<i>but before he gets too into it,</i>

506
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,449
<i>he does a trick.</i>

507
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:14,438
Kate, you have about an hour head start
before they come after you.

508
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,478
If I don't get a call from you
in the next hour,

509
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:18,895
I'm gonna know something
went wrong, and he dies!

510
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:20,730
We've got a boat.
They're letting us go.

511
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,682
- So you're safe, you and Sawyer?
- Yes. Yeah.

512
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,307
Promise me that you'll never
come back here for me.

513
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,320
<i>He wants to protect them both.</i>

514
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,095
<i>He says it out of love,
not out of heartbreak or jealousy.</i>

515
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,426
<i>Although Juliet's a woman,</i> and she
interprets it a little bit differently.

516
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,312
<i>She decides that she's going
to throw her lot in with Jack</i>

517
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,864
<i>and try to get off the island.</i>

518
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:41,164
He said that if I helped you,

519
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,770
that he would finally let me go home.

520
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,572
<i>But I don't think that Jack
has given up on Kate.</i>

521
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,440
No, I don't think so either.

522
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,410
- Kate, where are you going?
- I don't care what Jack said.

523
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,180
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

524
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,172
<i>Locke and Kate and Sayid decide
to go back across the island</i>

525
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,580
<i>in order to get Jack.</i>

526
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:02,548
I'll go around and cover the back,
you head in through the side door.

527
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,395
What are you doing here?
Get out of here.

528
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,491
- Jack...
- Kate, they're watching me.

529
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,160
Step back, doc.

530
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,496
I made a deal with them.

531
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,699
They're gonna let me go.

532
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:14,933
Where?

533
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,072
Home.

534
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,011
<i>Jack's goal is simply to get
these people off the island.</i>

535
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,967
And over the course of this season,
we've seen a lot of conflict

536
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,541
between Jack and Locke,
principally on this exact issue.

537
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:27,779
You don't have to point the gun at me,
I can tell you where Jack is.

538
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,197
I'm not looking for Jack.

539
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,350
I'm looking for the submarine.

540
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:32,553
What submarine?

541
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:34,994
The one you use to travel
to and from the island.

542
00:22:35,246 --> 00:22:36,677
It started back in season one...

543
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,087
Locke's desire to keep
everybody on the island,

544
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,517
<i>and slowly but surely,
he's methodically picking off</i>

545
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,203
<i>every possibility of rescue.</i>

546
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:46,581
- What are you doing here, John?
- I'm sorry, Jack.

547
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:47,999
Sorry for what?

548
00:25:54,447 --> 00:25:56,121
It's been nice chatting.

549
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,605
See you in another life, yeah?

550
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,090
<i>Crossing paths and intersecting lives...</i>

551
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,284
In some sense, I think this show
is about about

552
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,250
how we are all intertwined
in our lives.

553
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,727
<i>The linkage between these characters
is an important part</i>

554
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,094
<i>of their journey, and connected
metaphorically,</i>

555
00:26:09,183 --> 00:26:11,432
<i>the kind of journeys that
we all have in our own lives.</i>

556
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:14,233
<i>But the question remains...
Is it all for a reason?</i>

557
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,951
I fell in love with the wrong guy.

558
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,317
He conned me and embarrassed me.

559
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,874
- He was a bad guy.
- I have a son who's about your age.

560
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,048
<i>We find out, for example, that Jack
and Claire have the same father...</i>

561
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,737
- And I don't even know your name.
- Although they don't know

562
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:29,625
that they are half brother
and half sister.

563
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:30,870
I want it to stay that way.

564
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,466
<i>These are all stories about,
what are the series of events</i>

565
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,920
<i>that led them to get on this plane.</i>

566
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,802
<i>'Cause everything had to happen exactly
the way that it did happen,</i>

567
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,101
<i>and when they bump up against
each other, you realize</i>

568
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,701
<i>many of them wouldn't have made
the choice to get on that plane</i>

569
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:45,082
- <i>were it not for other people.</i>
- Tell me, what's a, um,

570
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,038
- walkabout?
- The walkabout

571
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,060
is a journey of spiritual renewal.

572
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,142
You wanna tell me something, Reyes?

573
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,212
The most significant event in Hurley's
life was that he was the lottery winner,

574
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:59,799
<i>that he's worth somewhere
north of $150 million.</i>

575
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,229
I've had some bad luck, too.

576
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,837
My, uh, grandpa Tito
died of a heart attack,

577
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,499
and the first house I bought
my mom burnt down.

578
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,564
<i>He bought himself
a Chicken Shack restaurant.</i>

579
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,630
<i>It's hit by a meteor.
Or is it a meteorite?</i>

580
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,210
- It's bad luck either way.
- <i>He comes to believe</i>

581
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:16,884
<i>that his life is cursed.</i>

582
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,120
<i>On the island, he's the guy that
everybody loves and gets along with.</i>

583
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,640
I bet four papayas.

584
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,817
<i>At the same time, he is hoping that</i>

585
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,705
<i>this island
has shed him of his unlucky curse.</i>

586
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,580
I have hope.

587
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,814
<i>There is a Dharma
bus on the island.</i>

588
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,274
<i>He decides that getting
this car running</i>

589
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,523
<i>will really be a manifestation
of the possibility of hope.</i>

590
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,428
Son of a bitch.

591
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,878
<i>But the van actually represents a little</i>
more than just that because

592
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,209
Hurley finds a dead body in the van.

593
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,705
- Poor... Roger.
- "Work man"?

594
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:57,388
- I'm a janitor?
- <i>He's, in fact, Benjamin Linus' father.</i>

595
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,196
A shocking revelation that
we've made recently is that Ben

596
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,343
<i>came to the island when he was
young child with his father,</i>

597
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,898
<i>who was janitor working
for the Dharma Initiative.</i>

598
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,656
<i>We know that he had a troubled
relationship with his daddy.</i>

599
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,255
It's your birthday.

600
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,390
Sorry I forgot.

601
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,126
Kinda hard to celebrate on the day
you killed your mom.

602
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,267
We went for a hike,

603
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,395
but you had to come early.

604
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,450
Now she's gone...

605
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,044
And I'm stuck here on this island...

606
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,738
with you.

607
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:30,216
<i>And that led him to become
a fairly dark and twisted individual.</i>

608
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,027
I've missed her, too.
Maybe as much as you have.

609
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:37,847
But the difference is
that for as long as I can remember,

610
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,182
I've had to put up with you.

611
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,088
Good-bye, dad.

612
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,878
<i>Many have wondered what became
of the Dharma Initiative.</i>

613
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,983
<i>We learned the answer when
Ben led a mass extermination</i>

614
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,576
<i>and emerged as
the leader of the Others.</i>

615
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,238
You want us to,

616
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,572
- go get his body?
- No, leave him out there.

617
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,153
<i>And we discovered that the Others and
the Dharma Initiative are not the same.</i>

618
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,866
<i>So while Sawyer is sitting there next
to this skeleton drinking beers,</i>

619
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:08,509
<i>they don't realize the sort
of dark story behind this van</i>

620
00:29:08,762 --> 00:29:09,888
<i>that has actually unfolded.</i>

621
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,121
- He's drinking beers with a skeleton...
- Correct.

622
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,067
And he's not aware that there's
anything dark about that?

623
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,014
No, he's having a good time,
believe it or not.

624
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:18,388
I mean, you get your kicks
any way you can on the island.

625
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,400
<i>Ben would be very happy if he was able
to be the leader of The Others</i>

626
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:23,710
<i>and was to grow them
into a prosperous society,</i>

627
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:25,281
<i>and now John Locke has shown up,</i>

628
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:28,416
<i>and John Locke has sort of exhibited
a certain specialness,</i>

629
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,535
<i>and that's really threatening to Ben.</i>

630
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:33,066
What if I told you that somewhere
on this island

631
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,310
there's a very large box,

632
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,162
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

633
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,957
when you opened that box,
there it would be.

634
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,841
- <i>That was a metaphor.</i>
- Dad?

635
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,402
<i>The whole island is a magic box.</i>

636
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,615
<i>The presence of Anthony Cooper
gave Ben an opportunity</i>

637
00:29:48,863 --> 00:29:50,787
- <i>to challenge Locke...</i>
- When people join us

638
00:29:51,045 --> 00:29:54,153
here on this island, they need to make
a gesture of commitment.

639
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,502
That's why you're gonna have
to kill your father.

640
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,204
<i>A challenge he knew would end
in Locke's disgrace.</i>

641
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,783
I'm sorry. He's not who
we thought he was.

642
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,924
<i>That is, until Richard
proposed an alternative.</i>

643
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,601
Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

644
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,871
Keep reading.

645
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,264
Sawyer, when we first meet him
on the island,

646
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,305
<i>he's carrying around
this mysterious letter.</i>

647
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,514
You wanna know what kind
of human being I am?

648
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,018
Read it.

649
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,195
"Dear Mr. Sawyer,
you don't know who I am,

650
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,383
but I know who you are
and I know what you done."

651
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,337
"You had sex with my mother, and then
you stole my dad's money all away... "

652
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:31,616
Get under the bed.

653
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:33,369
- Don't make a sound.
- Open this door!

654
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,734
"So he got angry
and he killed my mother... "

655
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,970
"and then he killed himself, too."

656
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,057
A very big thing that we've learned
about Sawyer

657
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,410
is that his name isn't Sawyer.

658
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,871
<i>The man who conned his parents
is named Sawyer,</i>

659
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:48,093
<i>and Sawyer has sort of taken
in a bizarre homage</i>

660
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:50,626
- <i>to this man that he wants to kill.
- We come to discover </i>

661
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,718
that the original Sawyer
is actually Locke's father.

662
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,369
<i>This is an incredible coincidence
as far as he's concerned,</i>

663
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,555
<i>but something that Locke knows about,
and that's why</i>

664
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,012
<i>he puts them in a room together.</i>

665
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:04,495
<i>And now Sawyer has this opportunity to
do what he's wanted to do for so long.</i>

666
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:06,027
Read it.

667
00:31:17,756 --> 00:31:20,920
<i>When you look at Cooper,
he's basically responsible for Locke

668
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:22,744
<i>becoming the man
that he became,

669
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:25,773
<i>and he's responsible for Sawyer
becoming the man that he became.

670
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,016
Thank you.

671
00:31:27,192 --> 00:31:30,071
Neither of those men would've
ended up on Oceanic 815

672
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:31,954
were it not for this guy.

673
00:31:32,197 --> 00:31:34,156
<i>Locke's return made it clear to Ben,

674
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:35,915
<i>that he was indeed a threat.

675
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,777
You said that if I killed my father,

676
00:31:40,216 --> 00:31:42,676
you'd tell me everything
I wanted to know about the island.

677
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:47,367
So why don't you start
at the beginning.

678
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:50,405
<i>Ben takes locke to this cabin
as sort of a litmus test

679
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:53,181
<i>to find out if Locke is
indeed special, and

680
00:31:53,451 --> 00:31:55,903
<i>the way he can determine whether
Locke is special is whether

681
00:31:56,255 --> 00:31:58,868
<i>he can commune with this mysterious
guy, Jacob, who is obviously

682
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,757
<i>above Ben in the hierarchy...

683
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,105
Help me.

684
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:04,704
And Locke hears Jacob say
"help me..."

685
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:06,228
What did you just say?

686
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,242
And that is enough for Ben to realize
that Locke represents

687
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:12,128
a massive threat to his primacy
as the leader of the Others.

688
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:15,066
So he lures Locke out to
this ditch where

689
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:18,110
all the dead Dharma bodies
were taken.

690
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,783
These are my people.

691
00:32:20,581 --> 00:32:22,294
They came here seeking harmony.

692
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:25,572
They couldn't even coexist
with the island's original inhabitants.

693
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,707
I was one of the people
that was smart enough

694
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,982
to make sure that
I didn't end up in that ditch...

695
00:32:30,506 --> 00:32:33,099
Which makes me considerably
smarter than you, John.

696
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,656
Why did you do this?

697
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,756
Because you heard him.

698
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:44,904
Now I need to know what he said.

699
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:46,371
He said...

700
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:48,987
"help me."

701
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:53,804
Well, I certainly hope
he helps you, John.

702
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:56,837
...myself to you?

703
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:59,825
You were standing right next to me
when that submarine exploded.

704
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,528
In that moment, I saw it yours eyes.

705
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:04,701
you want to get off this island more
than anything else in the world.

706
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,352
Make she's one of us.

707
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,800
After a long absence,

708
00:33:09,094 --> 00:33:10,490
the leader returned.

709
00:33:10,986 --> 00:33:12,839
Jack has now been liberated
from the Others.

710
00:33:13,085 --> 00:33:15,220
He's now back on the beach camp
with everybody else.

711
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,698
He brings Juliet with him.

712
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,241
What the hell is she doing here?

713
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:19,871
Our people don't trust Juliet.

714
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:22,299
Jack says, "leave her alone."
that makes Jack

715
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,768
impeachable in everybody else's eyes.
They wonder,

716
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:27,818
"why is he protecting her,
why is he defending her?"

717
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:29,712
Do you want him to get suspicious?

718
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:31,142
Suspicious of what?

719
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:33,306
Desmond has started
having these premitions.

720
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:36,778
There's a wire,

721
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,226
a cable buried in the sand.

722
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,797
This is future crap, isn't it?

723
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:41,046
This is important.

724
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:42,266
Why?

725
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:43,579
Because someone's coming.

726
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,597
- Is that a helicopter?
- Rescue.

727
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:48,447
Is that how a helicopter
is supposed to sound?

728
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:50,805
<i>The big event that happens
is this mysterious woman

729
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,259
<i>parachutes on to the island...

730
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:53,444
Sorry.

731
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:58,100
<i>And she's got a picture of
Penny and Desmond with her.

732
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,308
My God.

733
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:00,891
She is here with a group of people.

734
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:03,571
They're on a freighter 80 miles off
the coast, and their job

735
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,325
is to come rescue Desmond.

736
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,412
It's a satellite phone.

737
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:09,776
Assuming that they can get
that radio to work,

738
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,418
our guys can call that freighter
and they can get rescued.

739
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:13,609
Mom?

740
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:16,181
- But that's never gonna happen.
- Well, so you say.

741
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:18,327
<i>If they get off the island,
the show's over.

742
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:20,170
- Who are you?
- Hugo reyes.

743
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,475
I crashed here on Oceanic flight 815.

744
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:23,742
That's not possible.

745
00:34:23,994 --> 00:34:25,835
- It wasn't easy, but we found food.
- No.

746
00:34:26,082 --> 00:34:27,607
They found the plane.

747
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:29,806
There were no survivors.

748
00:34:30,479 --> 00:34:32,133
<i>One theory is that
they're in purgatory.

749
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,890
But you and I have said publicly
that they're not in purgatory.

750
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:37,287
<i>They're not ghosts. They are
actually alive and breathing

751
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,024
<i>somewhere in the space-time
continuum.

752
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:41,141
I need to talk to you...

753
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:42,303
In private.

754
00:34:42,496 --> 00:34:44,983
Anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of her.

755
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,936
Yeah, you know what?
You should stay.

756
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:49,329
It seems only fair considering
that she's the reason

757
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:51,939
no one wants to tell you that
there's a woman in Hurley's tent

758
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:53,702
who parachuted on to
the island yesterday.

759
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:55,104
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

760
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,016
Because they don't trust you.

761
00:34:57,913 --> 00:34:59,098
We should tell her.

762
00:34:59,368 --> 00:35:01,667
We're thinking something is going
on between these two,

763
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:03,344
and in fact, something is going on.

764
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,690
Juliet has told Jack what
her mission is.

765
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,279
<i>Juliet, it's Ben.

766
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,684
<i>I'm sending three teams
to extract  Kwon

767
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:10,968
<i>the night after tomorrow.

768
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,003
<i>If you determine anyone
else is pregnant,

769
00:35:13,273 --> 00:35:14,446
<i>mark their tents,

770
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:16,205
<i>and we'll take them, too.

771
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:18,480
And she has basically alerted us
to the fact that

772
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:20,766
the Others are now on their way
to the beach camp and

773
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,557
are going to extract
the pregnant women.

774
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:25,583
For the very first time,
we know exactly what they want,

775
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,794
when they're coming to get it,
and they have

776
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:29,073
no idea.

777
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:31,465
So tomorrow night,

778
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,128
we stop running, we stop living
in fear of them.

779
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,846
Because when they show up,

780
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,204
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

781
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:40,632
The problem is that the Others
now know about Naomi,

782
00:35:40,896 --> 00:35:42,820
the woman who has parachuted
on to the island.

783
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:45,986
If you leave right now, how long will
it take you to reach their camp?

784
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:48,332
if i take my ten best, we could
set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

785
00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:50,244
- Then you better get going.
- Juliet may not be ready.

786
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:53,005
- She hasn't had time to...
- Then we'll take all of their women.

787
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,480
If any of them are stupid enough
to get in your way,

788
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,063
kill 'em.

789
00:35:57,315 --> 00:35:59,872
I can't transmit using this
Danielle's distress signal

790
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:01,467
is overriding the frequency.

791
00:36:01,698 --> 00:36:03,997
If you tell me where the radio tower is,
i can go there,

792
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,851
switch off your message
and call for help.

793
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,219
The signal has been playing for the last
16 years, and nobody has heard it.

794
00:36:09,442 --> 00:36:11,014
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

795
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:13,595
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

796
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:15,308
- What station?
- They call it the looking glass.

797
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:17,572
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

798
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:18,820
I believe I do.

799
00:36:18,985 --> 00:36:20,398
<i>Sayid found this wire on the beach.

800
00:36:20,503 --> 00:36:22,152
<i>We always were wondering,
where did that wire go?

801
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:24,732
And now we discover that it actually
connects to this station

802
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:26,294
underwater called the "looking glass."

803
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,574
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

804
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,475
If it's flooded, then
how does it still work?

805
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:32,004
Even if the station's flooded,

806
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:34,690
I think I'll be able to find the relay
switch and disable it.

807
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:37,941
No, I'm not letting you go on some
suicide mission just to flip the switch.

808
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:40,229
Someone has to do it,
or we never leave this island.

809
00:36:40,457 --> 00:36:41,466
I do it.

810
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:44,023
Charlie, unfortunately,
has been told that he's gonna die.

811
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,958
If you don't, none of it will happen.

812
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:47,236
What?

813
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:48,738
What I saw, Charlie, was

814
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:52,069
Claire and her baby get into
a helicopter that leaves this island.

815
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,986
All right, tell me.

816
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:55,500
Are you sure you wanna know?

817
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,966
I want to know.

818
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,201
You're inside a hatch,

819
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:01,288
there's a blinking yellow light,

820
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,200
you flip the switch,

821
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:05,258
and you drown.

822
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,674
With the threat of
the Others imminent,

823
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:12,242
Charlie accepts his faithful mission

824
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,266
and instead of being fearful of this,
Charlie heroically embraces this fate,

825
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:18,049
and he goes, "so be it."

826
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,902
This needs to be done

827
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:21,498
to get us all rescued.

828
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:23,345
I'll be fine, Claire.

829
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:26,459
But you've got to
promise me something.

830
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:28,974
Don't worry about me.

831
00:37:31,657 --> 00:37:33,968
<i>True heroes are sort of
born out of moments.

832
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,159
<i>And the reality is, is most of
our characters are heroes.

833
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,736
<i>When the proverbial Others are coming...

834
00:37:41,897 --> 00:37:43,087
<i>Do you man up

835
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:44,588
<i>and take action?

836
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,207
So here we go again, huh?

837
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,154
Here we go again.

838
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,623
<i>These guys always act most nobly

839
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:53,145
<i>when they act in the spirit
of the community.

840
00:37:53,526 --> 00:37:55,086
<i>They protect each other.

841
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:56,458
Wait.

842
00:37:57,772 --> 00:38:00,505
Dude, it's fine. I don't even want to
go on your stupid boat.

843
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:01,971
Just remember I love you, man.

844
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:03,760
Whatever, I love you, too.

845
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:07,686
<i>The question remains,
what is the state of our cast aways?

846
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:10,137
<i>Are they gonna get off this island?

847
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,914
<i>Automatically, it's about the people.

848
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,181
<i>It always has been.

849
00:38:13,403 --> 00:38:16,981
<i>This island is given them an opportunity
to completely reinvent themselves,

850
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:20,002
<i>and that change for these characters
is really what the endgame

851
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:21,586
<i>of the show will be all about.

852
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,311
I'm alive!

853
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:40,563
