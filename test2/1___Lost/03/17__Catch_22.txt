1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,199
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,199
Let me ask you something

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,509
anything pal..

4
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,910
How did you know Claire was drowning?

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,300
CLAIRE!

6
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:25,032
I COULD HEAR HER
CALLING FOR HELP.

7
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:26,300
YOU, UH...

8
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:28,367
HEAR THE LIGHTNING
AS WELL?

9
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,334
I WASN'T SAVING CLAIRE,
CHARLIE.

10
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:47,167
I WAS SAVING YOU.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,967
WHEN I SAW THE LIGHTNING
HIT THE ROOF,

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,434
YOU WERE ELECTROCUTED,

13
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:55,465
AND WHEN YOU HEARD
CLAIRE WAS IN THE WATER,

14
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:58,766
YOU... YOU DROWNED
TRYING TO SAVE HER.

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,166
I'VE TRIED, BROTHER,
I'VE TRIED TWICE TO SAVE YOU,

16
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,334
BUT NO MATTER
WHAT I TRY TO DO...

17
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,299
YOU'RE GONNA DIE, CHARLIE.

18
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,167
YOU'RE INSANE, MATE.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,599
SUPERMAN CAN FLY
ROUND THE ENTIRE PLANET

20
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:30,399
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,100
DUDE, IF WE'RE GOING
BY A PURE FOOT RACE,

22
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,133
SUPES WOULD GET DUSTED
BY THE FLASH.

23
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:39,499
BUT WHY WOULD THE MAN OF STEEL
AGREE TO A SODDING FOOT RACE?

24
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,300
UH, FOR CHARITY?

25
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,033
AND FLASH WOULD TOTALLY WIN,

26
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:45,900
'CAUSE HE CAN, LIKE, VIBRATE
THROUGH WALLS AND STUFF.

27
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,833
OOH, VIBRATION.

28
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,300
WHATEVER WOULD SUPERMAN DO
IF HE CAME UP AGAINST A WALL?

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,257
Well, no smashing allowed

30
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,699
NO FLYING, NO SMASHING.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,800
ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?

32
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,800
PERHAPS WE SHOULD FIT SUPERMAN
WITH A PAIR OF KRYPTONITE...

33
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:04,267
THE HELL?

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,200
CHARLIE!
NO, DON'T! DON'T TOUCH IT.

35
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,666
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD,
OH, MY GOD!
JUST BREATHE. JUST BREATHE, HUH?

36
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,299
LOOKS LIKE IT'S HOMEMADE.
WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,855
NO! YOU HELP!
I CAN'T HELP!

38
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,466
I'M SORRY, MATE.

39
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,100
HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS.

40
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,666
SUPERMAN CAN FLY
AROUND THE ENTIRE PLANET...

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,066
HEY.

44
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,699
LISTEN TO ME.

45
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,333
THERE'S A WIRE,
A CABLE BURIED IN THE SAND.

46
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,833
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

47
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,232
THIS IS FUTURE CRAP,
ISN'T IT?

48
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:40,200
THE CABLE--
DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

49
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,233
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
WHY?

50
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:47,967
SUPERMAN...

51
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:54,633
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S COMING.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,200
GOD TESTS
OUR FAITH IN MANY WAYS.

53
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:54,101
SO, AS YOU WELL KNOW,
WE HAVE OUR OWN TEST HERE--

54
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:58,300
A VOW OF SILENCE THAT LASTS
AS LONG AS WE SEE FIT.

55
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,566
THIS CHALLENGES
BOTH ONE'S PATIENCE...

56
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,834
AND HIS FAITH.

57
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,767
FOR SOME,
IT MAY LAST A WEEK.

58
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,168
THOSE WE'RE LESS
SURE ABOUT, A MONTH.

59
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,199
PERSONALLY, DESMOND,

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,767
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D LAST...

61
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,168
AND SO NOW
I STAND CORRECTED.

62
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,067
FOR WHATEVER REASON,
YOUR PATH HAS LED YOU HERE.

63
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:32,001
AND NOW YOU'RE ONE OF US.

64
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,334
WELCOME, BROTHER.

65
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:40,168
THANK YOU...

66
00:05:40,201 --> 00:05:42,134
BROTHER.

67
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,001
MORNING, JACK.

68
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,667
MUST BE NICE
TO WAKE UP IN YOUR OWN BED.

69
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,934
YEAH. HOME, SWEET HOME.

70
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:02,299
SO I WAS WONDERING

71
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,101
IF I COULD BORROW
YOUR FIRST AID KIT.

72
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:08,984
I'VE, UH.
TWISTED MY ANKLE.

73
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,633
Do you want me to take a look at it?

74
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:16,567
NO, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,667
I'VE TAPED MY SHARE
OF ANKLES.

76
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,201
RIGHT.

77
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,201
THANKS.

78
00:06:28,834 --> 00:06:30,000
SOMETHING WRONG, HURLEY?

79
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:32,299
NO, UNH-UNH.

80
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,934
JUST... KEEPING
DESMOND HERE COMPANY...

81
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:39,700
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.

82
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,500
BRING THAT BACK WHEN
YOU'RE DONE WITH IT, OKAY?

83
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:45,667
ABSOLUTELY.

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,999
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,899
DO YOU WANT HIM
TO GET SUSPICIOUS?

86
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,568
SUSPICIOUS OF WHAT?

87
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,533
OH, THIS IS LIKE WHEN YOU KNEW
CLAIRE WAS DROWNING, ISN'T IT?

88
00:06:57,534 --> 00:06:58,799
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT
THE FIRST AID KIT.

89
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,999
SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT.
IS IT ME?
NO. IT'S JUST A PRECAUTION.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,466
LOOK, DUDE, YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE YOU TO THE WIRE?

91
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,467
I WANT AN EXPLANATION.

92
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,934
I SAW
A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS--

93
00:07:18,967 --> 00:07:20,901
THINGS THAT ARE
GONNA HAPPEN.

94
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,901
WHAT'D YOU SEE?

95
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,433
IT WAS...

96
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,934
IT WAS LIKE
A SORT OF JIGSAW PUZZLE,

97
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,934
ONLY I DIDN'T HAVE
THE PICTURE ON THE BOX,

98
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,266
SO I DON'T KNOW
HOW THE PIECES FIT EXACTLY.

99
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,567
BUT... BUT ONE OF THE PIECES--
THE FIRST ONE...

100
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,234
IT WAS YOU,

101
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,700
PULLING THE CABLE
OUT OF THE SAND.

102
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,967
SO WHAT ARE
THE OTHER PIECES?

103
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:46,967
IF I TELL YOU THAT,

104
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:49,234
IT'LL CHANGE
THE PICTURE ON THE BOX.

105
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,234
SO WHAT?

106
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:54,067
ISN'T THAT THE POINT--
PREVENTING SOMETHING BAD?

107
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:56,201
NOT THIS TIME.

108
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:59,600
SO YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO STOP
SOMETHING FROM HAPPENING.

109
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:02,268
YOU ACTUALLY
WANT IT TO HAPPEN.

110
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,600
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

111
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:27,234
HEY, FRECKLES, YOU HOME?

112
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,610
???

113
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:34,600
WELL, YOU WEREN'T AROUND
WHEN I LOST THE BET,

114
00:08:34,634 --> 00:08:37,134
SO YOU'RE...

115
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,234
EXEMPT.

116
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:45,667
WHAT'S UP?

117
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,800
I... WANTED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

118
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,001
YEAH?

119
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,700
I'M UP HERE.

120
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,433
UH...

121
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,467
SO DID YOU TELL HIM?

122
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,834
DID I TELL WHO WHAT?

123
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,766
YOU KNOW.

124
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,934
DID YOU TELL THE DOC...

125
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,433
ABOUT YOU AND ME?

126
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,268
NO...

127
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,234
BUT HE KNOWS.

128
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,700
HE SAW US ON ONE OF
THEIR SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.

129
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,701
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THE CAMERA WAS BROKEN.
WELL, THEY HAD ANOTHER CAMERA.

130
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:23,500
THOSE PERVERTS.

131
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,901
ANYWAY, HE KNOWS.

132
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,967
WELL, NOW THAT
THAT'S OUTTA THE WAY...

133
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,367
HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE AFTERNOON DELIGHT?

134
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:39,166
THAT MEANS SEX.

135
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,667
COME ON, FRECKLES,
WAIT. NOW--

136
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,400
DO YOU NEED ME
TO MAKE YOU A MIX TAPE?

137
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,034
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU
DO THAT?

138
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,033
DUDE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL ME AGAIN.

139
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,801
WHAT DO WE NEED JIN FOR?
BECAUSE HE WAS THERE WITH US.

140
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,900
ON THE BEACH,
WHEN I FIND THE CABLE?

141
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,067
THIS WAY.
HERE IT IS.

142
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,900
THAT'S RIGHT.

143
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,400
IN ONE
OF YOUR PUZZLE FLASHES?

144
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:09,962
AYE.

145
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:15,581
SO...
IF HE DOESN'T COME,

146
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,367
THEN NEITHER DOES
THE SOMEONE

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,990
YOU WON'T TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT?

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,009
THAT'D BE
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT,

149
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,967
BUT I'VE NO BLOODY IDEA

150
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:29,199
HOW I'M GONNA GET HIM
TO COME WITH US.

151
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,701
WATCH THE MASTER.

152
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:38,900
CAMPING?

153
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:41,434
YEAH, YOU KNOW, LIKE,
SLEEPING UNDER THE STARS,

154
00:10:41,437 --> 00:10:42,589
FIRE ON THE BEACH,

155
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,067
MARSHMALLOWS.

156
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:47,907
CAMPING.

157
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,267
YES.

158
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:58,734
EVERYBODY LIKES MARSHMALLOWS.

159
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,061
GOOD MAN.

160
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:01,867
GET FOOD, WATER.

161
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:03,884
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

162
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:05,109
WE NEED ONE MORE.

163
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,921
HOW DAFT
DO YOU THINK I AM?

164
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:12,313
THIS ISN'T A CAMPING TRIP.

165
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,817
YOU'VE HAD ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR VISIONS, HAVEN'T YOU?

166
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,667
WHAT WAS IT THIS TIME?

167
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:23,634
SOMEONE'S COMING
TO THE ISLAND.

168
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,704
COMING?

169
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,978
AS IN SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT ALREADY HERE?

170
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,533
HOW THE HELL
IS THAT GONNA HAPPEN?

171
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:32,933
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

172
00:11:34,937 --> 00:11:36,887
IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME?

173
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:40,101
WELL, YOU' A PART OF IT,
YEAH, AS ARE JIN AND HURLEY.

174
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:43,101
RIGHT, BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU HAVEN'T PREVIOUSLY TOLD

175
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:45,367
JIN OR HURLEY
THAT THEY'RE GONNA DIE.

176
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:50,554
WELL, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
NOT THIS TIME.

177
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,134
CAN I BRING MY GUITAR?

178
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,124
ABSOLUTELY.

179
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,534
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

180
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:10,017
YOU HAD ME WORRIED THE
FOR A SECOND.

181
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:40,996
THIS IS IT.

182
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,072
WELL, HOW CAN YOU TELL?

183
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:46,038
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE

184
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,674
I FOLLOWED THE WIRE
INTO THE JUNGLE.

185
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:49,868
WHERE IS IT, THEN?

186
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:54,973
WAY TO GO, DUDE.

187
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:00,473
HERE IT IS.

188
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:05,102
HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS.

189
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:06,385
THE BEACON
FELL THIS SIDE OF THE RISE.

190
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,738
JUST ONE THING--
LAST TIME I FOLLOWED THIS WIRE

191
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,706
INTO THE JUNGLE,
I ALMOST GOT KEBABBED

192
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,606
BY ONE OF ROUSSEAU'S
SPIKY DEATH TRAP THINGS.

193
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:16,382
CUT HER DOWN.

194
00:13:16,915 --> 00:13:19,665
WE'RE NOT GOING IN THE JUNGLE--
WELL, NOT YET.

195
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:23,883
IT'S GETTING LATE, SO, WE'LL,
UH, WE'LL CAMP HERE THE NIGHT.

196
00:13:24,853 --> 00:13:25,753
CAMP.

197
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,387
SO WHEN DO THEY GET HERE--

198
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,252
YOUR MYSTERIOUS SOMEONE?

199
00:13:35,637 --> 00:13:36,337
SOON.

200
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:47,204
YOU DO REALIZE
YOU ARE FREE

201
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,687
TO TALK AGAIN,
BROTHER DESMOND?

202
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:54,304
USED TO BEING QUIET,
I SUPPOSE.

203
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,204
MORIAH.

204
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,071
I FIND THE NAME
THE BROTHERS HAVE CHOSEN

205
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:04,838
FOR THE WINE MADE HERE...
INTERESTING.

206
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,089
AND WHY IS THAT, BROTHER?

207
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,484
WELL,
MORIAH IS THE MOUNTAIN

208
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:10,771
WHERE ABRAHAM WAS ASKED
TO KILL ISAAC.

209
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,718
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE MOST...

210
00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,705
FESTIVE LOCALE, IS IT?

211
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,171
AND YET GOD SPARED ISAAC.

212
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,883
WELL, ONE MIGHT ARGUE

213
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,675
THAT GOD NEED NOT
HAVE ASKED ABRAHAM

214
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:24,684
TO SACRIFICE HIS SON
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

215
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,210
WELL, THEN IT WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN MUCH OF A TEST,

216
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,239
WOULD IT, BROTHER?

217
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,994
PERHAPS YOU UNDERESTIMATE
THE VALUE OF SACRIFICE.

218
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,145
BROTHER DESMOND,
BROTHER DESMOND.

219
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:37,945
I MET THIS MAN
WAITING AT THE GATES.

220
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:39,502
HE SAYS HE NEEDS TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU.

221
00:14:46,244 --> 00:14:47,389
SORRY, SIR.

222
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:57,777
FORGIVE ME, BROTHER.

223
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:15,555
HEY.

224
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,377
HEY.

225
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,198
THE OATMEAL'S AWESOME.

226
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:21,645
IT IS, HUH?

227
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,511
IT'S STRANGE, HUH?

228
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,045
WHAT'S THAT?

229
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:30,660
BEING BACK,

230
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:34,489
NOT LOOKING
FOR A WAY OUT OF A CAGE,

231
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,745
NOT FINDING A REASON

232
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:39,096
TO GO RUNNING OFF
INTO THE JUNGLE AGAIN.

233
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:41,377
I ALMOST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF.

234
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:43,378
WELL, ENJOY IT.

235
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:46,178
I'M SURE SOMETHING
WILL GO WRONG SOON ENOUGH.

236
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:54,412
WELL, MY BIG, DANGEROUS
ADVENTURE FOR TONIGHT

237
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:58,111
IS GONNA BE DOING THE DISHES
IN THE OCEAN.

238
00:15:58,145 --> 00:15:59,744
WELL, BE CAREFUL.

239
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:02,978
I'LL TRY.

240
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:06,911
UM, CAN I BORROW
THAT SPOON?

241
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,945
YEAH.

242
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:16,711
THANKS.

243
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,477
GOOD NIGHT.

244
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,111
YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

245
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:58,611
WHAT,
MY DOORBELL BUSTED AGAIN?

246
00:17:00,178 --> 00:17:03,312
THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

247
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,378
SHUT UP AND DON'T TALK.

248
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:11,872
HEY...

249
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:15,045
YOU CRYING?

250
00:17:15,026 --> 00:17:16,945
I SAID SHUT UP.

251
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:25,511
YOU GOT IT.

252
00:18:18,844 --> 00:18:21,026
DUDE, I LOVE
THE PART ABOUT THE BIRD.

253
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:22,706
IT WAS A BIRD, RIGHT?

254
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:23,511
YOU.

255
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:27,609
ME? OKAY, UM,
HAVE YOU HEARD THE ONE

256
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,241
ABOUT THE CHUPACABRA?
CHUPA?

257
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,444
YEAH,
IT'S LIKE A BEAR WITH SPINES,

258
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:35,511
BUT MEXICAN...

259
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,593
THANKS.

260
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:40,178
WHO'S THAT?

261
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:49,445
HER NAME'S PENNY.

262
00:18:50,478 --> 00:18:52,245
THAT'S NOT BAD, DES,

263
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,445
NOT BAD AT ALL.

264
00:18:53,446 --> 00:18:57,332
SO HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO
LEAVE HER BEHIND AND COME HERE?

265
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:01,777
BECAUSE I'M A COWARD.

266
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,538
SORRY.

267
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,960
YOU AND ME BOTH, PAL.

268
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:11,851
YOU KNOW, I TRIED
TO RUN AWAY FROM SHE,

269
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,478
AND SHE...
SHE TRACKED ME DOWN.

270
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:17,451
"WITH ENOUGH MONEY
AND DETERMINATION,

271
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,822
YOU CAN FIND ANYONE,"
SHE SAID.

272
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:23,577
YOU KNOW, I USED TO
GET THROUGH MY NIGHTS

273
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,178
THINKING
THAT SHE ACTUALLY MEANT IT,

274
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,909
THAT SHE NEVER GAVE UP...

275
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:32,861
THAT MAYBE SHE SPENT
THE LAST THREE YEARS...

276
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,478
LOOKING FOR ME.

277
00:19:45,345 --> 00:19:46,577
WHAT'S THAT?

278
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:00,586
IS THAT A HELICOPTER?

279
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:01,978
RESCUE.

280
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:14,008
UH, IS THAT HOW A HELICOPTER'S
SUPPOSED TO SOUND?

281
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,412
NO.

282
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:38,583
WE GOTTA GO OUT THERE.

283
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,606
OUT THERE?
WELL, YEAH.

284
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,246
IN WHAT?
WELL, WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

285
00:20:45,197 --> 00:20:46,011
LOOK.

286
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,555
LOOK!

287
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,312
OH, MY GOD.

288
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:10,863
PALLET?

289
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:13,307
NAH, DUDE, IT'S NOT A FOOD DROP.
YOU SAW THE BEACON THING.

290
00:21:13,308 --> 00:21:16,130
SOMEONE, LIKE, EJECTED.
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS
A HELICOPTER.

291
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:19,864
YOU CAN'T EJECT
FROM A HELICOPTER.
WELL, MAYBE THEY JUMPED.

292
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:21,863
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT THEY'RE HERE.

293
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,956
"THEY"? HOW DO WE EVEN KNOW
IT'S A PERSON?

294
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,467
BECAUSE HE SAID
"SOMEONE" WAS COMING.

295
00:21:28,881 --> 00:21:29,907
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

296
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,764
OUT TO WHERE IT FELL.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

297
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:34,609
NO, WHOA, SLOW DOWN.

298
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:36,881
WE'RE NOT GONNA
TRUDGE OUT INTO THE JUNGLE

299
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:38,323
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
YES, WE ARE.

300
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,327
WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO HURLEY

301
00:21:40,328 --> 00:21:42,444
WHEN HE MENTIONED
ROUSSEAU'S DEATH TRAP?

302
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,608
NOW IT'S GONNA BE LIGHT
IN TWO HOURS.

303
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,698
WE'LL WAIT UNTIL--
SHE CAN'T WAIT.

304
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:48,619
SHE?

305
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,003
THEY. WHOEVER IT IS...
COULD BE HURT.

306
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,215
WE HAVE TO GO--
ALL FOUR OF US--NOW.

307
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:56,010
WHY?

308
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,715
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

309
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:04,625
RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS IT'S
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN WITHOUT ME.

310
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,000
SUPERMAN...

311
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,310
WE'LL LEAVE
AT FIRST LIGHT, THEN...

312
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:28,554
TOGETHER.

313
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,528
TERRIFIC.

314
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,189
IS YOUR SISTER IN?

315
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:47,866
LEAVE... NOW.

316
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:51,328
LET HIM BE, DEREK.

317
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,747
HELLO, RUTH.

318
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,677
SO YOU'RE A MONK NOW,
ARE YOU?

319
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:08,055
WELL, TECHNICALLY I'M STILL
WHAT THEY CALL A NOVICE,

320
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:08,960
TILL THE ABBOTT SAYS--

321
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,659
WHY ARE YOU HERE, DESMOND?

322
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:15,338
WELL, NOW THAT
MY INITIATION IS DONE, UH...

323
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,614
I FELT LIKE
I OWED YOU AN EXPLANATION.

324
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,838
DESMOND...

325
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:26,389
YOU CAN NEVER BEGIN
TO EXPLAIN WHAT YOU DID.

326
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:29,144
YOU LEFT ONE WEEK
BEFORE THE WEDDING.

327
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,645
EVERYTHING WAS PLANNED,
BOUGHT AND PAID FOR.

328
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,860
YOU JUST DISAPPEARED
COMPLETELY.

329
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,381
I HAD A CALLING.

330
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,176
WE DATED FOR SIX YEARS,
AND THE CLOSEST YOU EVER CAME

331
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:43,558
TO A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE
WAS CELTIC WINNING THE CUP.

332
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,590
LOOK... YES, I WAS SCARED
ABOUT THE WEDDING,

333
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,579
SO I HAD A FEW PINTS
TOO MANY, MAYBE. I...

334
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:56,697
I RAISED MY EYES,
AND I ASKED,

335
00:23:58,129 --> 00:23:59,548
"AM I DOING
THE RIGHT THING?"

336
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,600
AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER.

337
00:24:02,954 --> 00:24:04,141
AND WHEN I WOKE UP,

338
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,582
I WAS LYING ON MY BACK
IN THE STREET,

339
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:08,379
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW I GOT THERE.

340
00:24:08,717 --> 00:24:12,848
AND THERE WAS THIS MAN
STANDING OVER ME, RUTH...

341
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,024
AND HE REACHED OUT HIS HAND

342
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,476
AND HE SAID TO ME,

343
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,831
"CAN I HELP YOU, BROTHER?"

344
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,367
AND THE FIRST THING
I NOTICED WAS

345
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:24,557
THE ROPE
TIED AROUND HIS WAIST,

346
00:24:25,314 --> 00:24:27,871
AND I LOOKED AT HIM
AND... I KNEW.

347
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:31,656
I KNEW I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO WITH HIM.

348
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,633
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE...

349
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:38,542
EVERYTHING THAT MATTERED
BEHIND.

350
00:24:39,705 --> 00:24:41,505
SACRIFICE ALL OF IT...

351
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:44,495
FOR A GREATER CALLING.

352
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:49,857
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

353
00:24:49,858 --> 00:24:51,659
A BLOODY SHEPHERD
DIDN'T HELP YOU UP,

354
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:55,321
OR I SUPPOSE YOU'D BE OFF
WITH THE SHEEP, WOULDN'T YOU?

355
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,595
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO BREAK UP
WITH SOMEONE, DES,

356
00:25:02,176 --> 00:25:03,748
DON'T JOIN A MONASTERY.

357
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:08,530
JUST TELL THE GIRL
YOU'RE TOO BLOODY SCARED.

358
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,294
YOU A DOCTOR OR A CARPENTER?

359
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:22,083
WHAT, YOUR DAD NEVER
TAUGHT YOU TO USE A HAMMER?

360
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,978
NOMY DAD TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DRINK.

361
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:26,965
WELL,
AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING.

362
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,636
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING.

363
00:25:32,973 --> 00:25:35,248
YOU TWO ARGUING OVER
WHO'S YOUR FAVORITE OTHER?

364
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,548
WHAT DO YOU WANT, SAWYER?

365
00:25:37,891 --> 00:25:40,143
OH, WHAT I WANTED, DOC,
WAS TO INFORM YOU

366
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:42,747
THERE'S BEEN SOME DEVELOPMENTS
SINCE YOU WERE A.W.O.L.

367
00:25:44,247 --> 00:25:45,483
SO TELL ME...

368
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,766
HOW'S YOUR BACKHAND?

369
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:55,819
WHERE'D YOU GET THE TABLE?

370
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,247
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE IT?

371
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,663
IT FELL OUT OF THE PURPLE HAZE
WHEN THE HATCH WENT BLAMMO.

372
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,685
IF WE DON'T PLAY
EVERY 108 MINUTES,

373
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:04,788
THE ISLAND'S GONNA EXPLODE.

374
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:09,783
FINALLY, SOMETHING
I CAN BEAT YOU AT.

375
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,951
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING
I HAVEN'T PLAYED SINCE I WAS 12,

376
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:17,338
I WOULDN'T BE TOO PROUD.

377
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,757
WHAT IS THAT, 18-POINT?

378
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:21,765
YEAH.

379
00:26:22,762 --> 00:26:24,247
IT'S KINDA STRANGE, HUH...

380
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:26,658
BEING BACK?

381
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,553
SOMETHIN' FUNNY?

382
00:26:29,752 --> 00:26:33,332
UH, KATE SAID THE SAME THING
IN THE KITCHEN LAST NIGHT.

383
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:37,203
SHE DID, HUH?
SHE DID.

384
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,661
19-POINT.

385
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,212
SO YOU GUYS
ATE TOGETHER, HUH?

386
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:50,654
NO, JULIET AND I HAD DINNER
TOGETHER LAST NIGHT.

387
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:52,839
HUH.

388
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,705
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE?

389
00:27:05,642 --> 00:27:06,817
YOU GOT IT.

390
00:27:10,574 --> 00:27:11,458
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

391
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,694
NEXT?

392
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,398
YEAH, YOU SAW THE WIRE,

393
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,747
THE FLASHY THING
FALLING OUT OF THE SKY.

394
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:18,879
NOW WHAT?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU FIND--

395
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,538
THAT'S IT.
THERE IS NO NEXT.

396
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:23,499
WE FIND THE BEACON.

397
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,457
WHY ARE YOU
LYING TO ME, MATE?

398
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:26,582
LOOK, MATE,

399
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:29,558
I'VE SAVED YOUR LIFE
THREE TIMES NOW.

400
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,211
IF THAT HASN'T
BOUGHT ME YOUR TRUST,

401
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:35,395
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.
LET'S MOVE.

402
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:45,781
DUDE...

403
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,438
SERIOUSLY,
I'M GONNA HAVE A CORONARY.

404
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,967
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT,
AND IF YOU DON'T GET A MOVE ON,

405
00:27:50,968 --> 00:27:52,526
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT
BEFORE NIGHTFALL--
HEY.

406
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:54,897
LOOK AT THIS.

407
00:27:58,066 --> 00:27:59,628
IT CAN'T BE ROUSSEAU'S.

408
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:00,978
IF IT WAS ROUSSEAU'S,
A MASSIVE ROCK

409
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,568
WOULD BE FLYING
AT MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

410
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:05,890
DON'T MOVE.

411
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:07,241
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OW!
DON'T MOVE.

412
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,160
OW! AAH!

413
00:28:09,594 --> 00:28:12,475
AAH!

414
00:28:16,505 --> 00:28:18,745
DID THAT COME DOWN WITH
THE FLASHI RED LIGHT THINGY?

415
00:28:22,729 --> 00:28:24,012
WALKIE-TALKIE.

416
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,474
NO, DUDE,
THAT'S A SATELLITE PHONE.

417
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,881
CRAP, IT'S DEAD.

418
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:36,200
SHOCKER.

419
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,094
OH, MY GOD.

420
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,059
IS THAT YOU?

421
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:53,342
THEN WHO'S SHE

422
00:28:54,806 --> 00:28:57,430
THAT WOULD BE PENNY.

423
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:14,606
WHAT'S THIS?

424
00:29:14,607 --> 00:29:15,882
YOUR MIX TAPE.

425
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:22,648
WELL, YOU GONNA TAKE IT,
OR AIN'T YA?

426
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:26,535
"THE BEST
OF PHIL COLLINS," HUH?

427
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:28,302
DON'T GET PICKY.

428
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:31,003
AND IF BERNARD ASKS,
I DON'T KNOW A THING ABOUT IT.

429
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,429
THANKS, JAMES.

430
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,414
SO WHY'D YOU JUMP ME
LAST NIGHT?

431
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:39,309
WHAT?

432
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,765
WAS IT 'CAUSE YOU SAW THE DOC
HANGING OUT WITH JULIET?

433
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:45,896
IT IS NOT LIKE THAT.

434
00:29:46,105 --> 00:29:46,923
IT'S NOT?

435
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,337
YOU AIN'T GOTTA USE ME,
FRECKLES.

436
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,749
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS ASK.

437
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:06,860
YOU THINK IT'S HER,
DON'T YOU?

438
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:09,235
WHO?

439
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:13,455
YOUR GIRL--PENNY.

440
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,001
YOU THINK IT'S ACTUALLY HER WHO
BAILED OUT OF THE HELICOPTER.

441
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,313
EARLIER I HOPED IT.

442
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:21,938
NOW I KNOW IT.

443
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:27,049
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

444
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,990
WOULD YOU COME IF I HAD?

445
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:31,834
OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

446
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,110
I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU
BECAUSE...

447
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:38,862
I DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING TO CHANGE.

448
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:40,883
FAIR ENOUGH.

449
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:43,112
LOOK, IF WHATEVER
YOU'RE SEEING

450
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:44,732
LEADS TO YOUR GIRL
GETTING US RESCUED,

451
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,574
WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO CHANGE ANYTHING? RIGHT?

452
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:50,202
RIGHT.

453
00:30:59,064 --> 00:30:59,946
RIGHT.

454
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:08,739

BRINGING AN UMBRELLA, DUDE.

BROTHER DESMOND?

459
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:38,657
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

460
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,592
WELL,
I BELIEVE I'M GETTING PISSED

461
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:43,977
ON OUR LOVELY WINE.

462
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:49,093
THAT BOTTLE OF OUR LOVELY WINE
FETCHES OVER 100 QUID.

463
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,532
WE'VE ONLY BOTTLED
108 CASES THIS YEAR.

464
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:54,784
WELL, IT'S JUST AS WELL

465
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:56,945
WE'VE TAKEN A VOW OF POVERTY
THEN, ISN'T IT?

466
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:59,879
WE'VE ALSO TAKEN
A VOW OF CHARITY.

467
00:32:02,392 --> 00:32:03,317
RIGHT.

468
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:14,664
SOMETHING TELLS ME,
DESMOND,

469
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:16,486
THAT YOU'RE NOT
CUT OUT TO BE A MONK.

470
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:20,412
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD--
I'VE HAD A TOUGH WEEK.

471
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:28,764
I'M SORRY FOR THE WINE.

472
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,359
I'LL TAKE THE PENANCE.

473
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:35,634
I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE BEYOND PENANCE, DESMOND.

474
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:38,787
BROTHER DESMOND.

475
00:32:40,214 --> 00:32:41,373
NOT ANYMORE.

476
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,625
ARE--ARE YOU FIRING ME?

477
00:32:47,076 --> 00:32:48,478
I AM INDEED.

478
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,827
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

479
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,229
I HEARD THE CALL.

480
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,840
I'M SURE
YOU DID HEAR THE CALL,

481
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:57,895
BUT THE ABBEY CLEARLY ISN'T
WHERE YOU ARE MEANT TO END UP.

482
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:00,681
I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT
THAT GOD HAS DIFFERENT PLANS

483
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,912
THAN YOU BEING A MONK,
DESMOND--BIGGER PLANS.

484
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:04,967
OH, AYE, SURE HE DOES.

485
00:33:04,968 --> 00:33:09,331
HE DOES. YOU'VE JUST SPENT
TOO MUCH TIME RUNNING AWAY

486
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:12,186
TO REALIZE WHAT
YOU MAY BE RUNNING TOWARD.

487
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,054
HEY.

488
00:33:31,263 --> 00:33:32,855
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

489
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,171
WHATEVER COMES NEXT.

490
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:51,961
WHO'S PENNY?

491
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,548
SHE'S A CHICK
DESMOND USED TO DATE,

492
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:57,104
AND NOW HE THINKS
SHE FELL FROM THE SKY.

493
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:58,812
SO WE'RE GONNA
GO SAVE HER LIFE,

494
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,602
AND SHE'S GONNA
GET US RESCUED.

495
00:34:06,847 --> 00:34:09,423
DUDE, EVEN IF I SPOKE KOREAN,
IT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

496
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:12,212
HEY, WE'LL MOVE FASTER
IF WE STOP TALKING.

497
00:34:12,327 --> 00:34:13,486
SHE MIGHT BE HURT.

498
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:15,751
I'M MOVING
AS FAST AS I CAN.

499
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:18,752
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
DUDE, I'M NOT EXACTLY THE FLASH.

500
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:20,864
THE FLASH IS PATHETIC.

501
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,280
YOU GOT SOMETHING AGAINST
THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE?

502
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,417
YOU'RE INSANE, MATE!

503
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:28,793
SUPERMAN CAN FLY AROUND
THE ENTIRE PLANET

504
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:29,938
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

505
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:32,312
DUDE, IF WE'RE GOING
BY A PURE FOOT RACE,

506
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,234
SUPES WOULD GET DUSTED
BY THE FLASH.

507
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:37,958
BUT WHY WOULD THE MAN OF STEEL
AGREE TO A SODDING FOOT RACE?

508
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,895
UH, FOR CHARITY?
THE FLASH WOULD TOTALLY WIN,

509
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:43,159
'CAUSE HE CAN, LIKE, VIBRATE
THROUGH WALLS AND STUFF.

510
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,309
OOH, VIBRATION.

511
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,577
AND WHAT WOULD SUPERMAN DO
IF HE CAME UP AGAINST A WALL?

512
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:48,557
WELL, NO SMASHING ALLOWED.

513
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,180
NO FLYING, NO SMASHING.

514
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:55,493
ANY OTHER RESTRICTIONS
I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT?

515
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,970
PERHAPS WE SHOULD FIT SUPERMAN

516
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,675
WITH A PAIR OF KRYPTONITE
BALLET SLIPPERS...

517
00:35:04,391 --> 00:35:05,187
THE HELL?

518
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:09,084
OH, CHARLIE, DUCK!

519
00:35:20,584 --> 00:35:21,283
DUDE.

520
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
THIS WAY.

521
00:35:35,074 --> 00:35:38,101
NO, THE BEACON FELL
THIS SIDE OF THE RISE.
NO, THERE.

522
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:41,693
HOW ABOUT WE SPLIT UP?
ME AND CHARLIE'LL GO THAT WAY.

523
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:42,844
YOU AND JIN GO AROUND,

524
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:44,413
AND WE'LL MEET UP
AT THAT RIDGE OVER THERE.

525
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:48,733
UH, YOU AND JIN.
I'LL STICK WITH DESMOND.

526
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,878
YOU SAID "DUCK."

527
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:02,584
SORRY?

528
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:04,379
YOU SHOUTED, "DUCK."

529
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:08,799
YOU KNEW,
EVEN BEFORE WE SET OFF.

530
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,992
YOU KNEW ALL THIS TIME,
DIDN'T YOU?
AYE.

531
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:12,648
WELL, THEN, WHY DIDN'T
YOU SAY ANYTHING?

532
00:36:12,649 --> 00:36:14,627
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE COME.

533
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,891
OH, YOU NEEDED ME TO COME 'CAUSE
I WAS PART OF YOUR VISION.

534
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:20,883
YOU THOUGHT THE ONLY WAY
YOU COULD GET YOUR GIRL BACK

535
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:22,887
WAS IF TOOK AN ARROW
IN THE HEAD.

536
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:25,478
YOU WERE GONNA SACRIFICE ME.

537
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,102
IF THE FLASHES DON'T HAPPEN
EXACTLY AS I SAW THEM,

538
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:30,319
THE PICTURE CHANGES.

539
00:36:32,631 --> 00:36:34,656
I WAS SUPPOS
TO LET YOU DIE, CHARLIE.

540
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:36,367
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

541
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:38,369
IT MEANS
IT'S BLOODY POINTLESS.

542
00:36:39,446 --> 00:36:42,607
I KEEP SAVING YOUR LIFE,
AND WHAT GOOD HAS IT DONE?

543
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:44,816
IT'S JUST GONNA KEEP
HAPPENING AGAIN AND AGAIN.

544
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:48,178
MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT, YEAH?
MAYBE IT'S A TEST.
A TEST?

545
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,835
LIKE GOD TESTING ABRAHAM,

546
00:36:49,836 --> 00:36:51,453
EXCEPT I FAILED...

547
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:53,971
BECAUSE I CHANGED
WHAT I SAW.

548
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:12,682
HEY!
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

549
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:13,975
HELLO!

550
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,812
DUDE, SHE'S NOT MOVING.

551
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:25,320
I'M SORRY, PENNY.

552
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:27,900
I'M SORRY.

553
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:45,216
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D LEFT
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

554
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:46,811
NO.

555
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,859
I NEARLY TOOK THIS WITH ME.

556
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:56,659
IF YOU'RE NOT IN A HURRY,

557
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:59,426
BROTHER MARTIN'S HEADING
INTO TOWN IN A FEW HOURS.

558
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:05,065
THAT IS, IF YOU DON'T MIND
DOING SOME HEAVY LIFTING.

559
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:09,370
ALL TEN CASES ARE READY TO GO.

560
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,458
DESMOND THERE
IS JUST GETTING THE LAST ONE.

561
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:15,389
THANK YOU, AND MY FATHER
SENT THE CHECK IN ADVANCE?

562
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,583
AND PLEASE THANK HIM
FOR HIS GENEROUS DONATION.

563
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:19,544
ALWAYS A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU.

564
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:24,485
GOOD-BYE, DESMOND.

565
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:34,197
I THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIT IT ALL IN THE BACK,

566
00:38:34,198 --> 00:38:36,029
AND IF NOT, WE'LL PUT
THE REST IN THFRONT.

567
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,821
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

568
00:38:42,418 --> 00:38:43,441
ABSOLUTELY.

569
00:38:56,255 --> 00:38:57,606
YOU'D BETTER
DRIVE SAFE, MISS.

570
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:00,132
THIS VINEYARD ONLY MAKES
A LIMITED NUMBER

571
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:03,349
OF THESE CASES EACH YEAR.
IS THAT SO?

572
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,676
AYE. IT'S BECAUSE
THE MONKS ARE LAZY.

573
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,970
YOU KNOW, IT'S EASIER MAKING
GRAPE JELLY THAN WINE.

574
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:12,316
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT MONKS?

575
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,569
I'M AN EX-MONK.

576
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,444
REALLY?

577
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,203
AS OF LAST NIGHT.

578
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,437
I WAS FIRED.

579
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:24,455
WELL, IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.
I'M SORRY. I'VE NEVER--
I'VE--

580
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:26,231
I DIDN'T KNOW
MONKS COULD BE FIRED.

581
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,300
OH, THEY CAN.

582
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:30,196
YOU KNOW, I WAS TOLD
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS

583
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:33,789
THAT THE ABBEY WASN'T
WHERE I WAS MEANT TO END UP,

584
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:37,244
JUST A...
STEP ALONG THE PATH.

585
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:40,182
YOU KNOW, GOD ALLEGEDLY
HAS BIGGER PLANS FOR ME.

586
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,821
SOMETHING TELLS ME YOU DON'T

587
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:49,762
ENTIRELY BELIEVE THAT.
I SUSPECT
THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T.

588
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,128
WELL, MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN, JUST THINK,

589
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:53,759
IF YOU HADN'T GOTTEN FIRED,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE MET,

590
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,111
AND THEN HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY HELP ME

591
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:58,324
UNLOAD THESE CRATES
IN CARLISLE?

592
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,844
DID I SAY I WAS
COMING TO CARLISLE WITH YOU?

593
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,665
NOT YET.

594
00:40:14,735 --> 00:40:17,157
I MEAN, OF COURSE, IF AN EX-MONK
ALREADY HAS PLANS...

595
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,928
YOU KNOW, I DON'T USUALLY
GET INTO CARS WITH STRANGERS.

596
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:21,700
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'M PENELOPE.

597
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:25,945
PENNY.

598
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,004
DESMOND.

599
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,187
VERY NICE
TO MEET YOU, PENNY.

600
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:44,833
SHE'S ALIVE.

601
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,295
STAND BACK!

602
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:50,301
GET AWAY FROM HER!

603
00:40:52,475 --> 00:40:53,333
I'M HERE.

604
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:56,027
I'M HERE, PENNY.
BE CAREFUL.

605
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,464
JUST GET OFF, CHARLIE.

606
00:40:57,797 --> 00:40:59,686
SORRY, PENNY. SORRY.

607
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:08,671
DESMOND?
