00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:01,967
<i>Previously on Lost...</i>

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:03,812
You stole my kidney.

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,215
You need a father,
and I need a kidney.

4
00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:07,488
Get over it.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,485
I know you were raised in foster care.

6
00:00:15,566 --> 00:00:16,926
I know you spent the four years

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,319
prior to your arrival
on this island in a wheelchair,

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,021
and I know how you ended up in it.

9
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,636
What if I told you
that somewhere on this island,

10
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:26,000
there's a very large box,

11
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:30,317
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

12
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,745
when you opened that box,
there it would be?

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,756
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up new submarine.

14
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,535
Well, John, you've really
gone and done it now.

15
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,489
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again, are you?

16
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,722
No, John. I'm gonna show you
what came out of it.

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
Dad?

18
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,237
Save your breath.

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,551
Nobody's gonna hear you.

20
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,112
Dad?

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,254
What is this?

22
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:52,356
You tell me.
You brought him here.

23
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:53,953
I didn't bring him here.

24
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,772
I'd be careful about getting
too close to him, John.

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,173
Well, where did you find him?
Why did you bring him here?

26
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,605
I've already said...
We didn't...

27
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,321
You want me to ask him
how he got here?

28
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:05,406
Be my guest.

29
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,400
I warned you, John.

30
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,379
Don't you know, John?

31
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:19,378
Don't you know where we are?

32
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,295
What did he mean?

33
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,188
I'm afraid we don't have time
to deal with that right now, John.

34
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:31,881
We're leaving first thing
in the morning, all of us.

35
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,033
Where are you going?

36
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,549
We're going to a new place.

37
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:39,658
Well, an old place, actually.

38
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,334
Would you like to come with us?

39
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:50,675
Yes.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,860
Good.

41
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,543
We're holding Kate
a few buildings over from here.

44
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,471
I can't sleep
if I'm not in my own tent.

45
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,418
Fine.
Let's go to your tent.

46
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,652
It's nothing personal.
It's...

47
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,466
Old habits, you know?

48
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:46,575
Fine. Scram.

49
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,721
You want me to walk you home?

50
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:53,902
It's five tents.
I think I'll make it.

51
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:57,223
Are you sure?
I gotta pee anyway.

52
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,310
That is so romantic.

53
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,619
What the hell y'all doin'?

54
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,070
What the hell you doing?

55
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:29,839
Going to take a leak.

56
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:32,833
Yeah, well, so are we.

57
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:37,584
Well, all righty then.

58
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:03,862
Hello, James.

59
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,708
Subtitles: swsub.com

60
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:24,139
You wanna zip your pants up?

61
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,083
What the hell
are you doing here?

62
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:29,528
Looking for you, actually.

63
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,758
Okay, Tarzan.

64
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,860
Now that you're back
from your "blow up everything

65
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:36,465
that could get us off the island" tour,

66
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,911
how 'bout you tell me
why you joined up with the damn enemy?

67
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,678
I didn't join 'em.
I infiltrated 'em.

68
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:45,056
- You're undercover with the others.
- That's right.

69
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:47,666
Now how 'bout you give me
one reason to believe that?

70
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,648
Because a few hours ago

71
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,959
I snuck into Ben's tent
and kidnapped him.

72
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,569
I tied him up,
dragged him off into the jungle.

73
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:02,095
And you came all the way back here
to tell me this because...

74
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:04,415
Because this is the same man
who tortured you,

75
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:06,260
beat you, humiliated you...

76
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,855
And I want you to kill him.

77
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,224
You want him dead,
you kill him.

78
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,058
- I'm not a murder.
- Neither am I.

79
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,627
Except for the man you killed in sydney.

80
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,375
They got files on us, James...

81
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:28,586
All of us.

82
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,491
Yeah, well, their files
got their facts wrong.

83
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,223
Then I made a mistake coming to you.

84
00:06:47,897 --> 00:06:49,922
Please don't tell anyone
that I was here.

85
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,208
Hey, stop!

86
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,146
I said stop!

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,028
Damn it! Wait up!

88
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,540
There.
That ought to do it.

89
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,896
Thanks.

90
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,721
That would've taken me hours
to do myself.

91
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:24,521
Glad I could help.

92
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:29,457
Don't mind them.

93
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:31,761
They're all just excited you're here.

94
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,022
Excited?

95
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,143
We've been waiting for you.

96
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:38,418
John, you got a minute?

97
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,186
Ben's asking for you.

98
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,521
Okay.

99
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,135
<i>Ben, it's 6:00 a.m. on saturday morning.</i>

100
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,302
<i>Kwon is pregnant.
The fetus is healthy</i>

101
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:54,055
<i>and was conceived on island
with her husband.</i>

102
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,762
<i>He was sterile
when they got here.</i>

103
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,491
Hello, John.
Thanks for coming.

104
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,100
What's that?

105
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,017
Juliet is gathering information
for us at your former camp.

106
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:08,331
She's determing if any
of the women are pregnant.

107
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,133
Then we're gonna go in and...

108
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,062
Take them.

109
00:08:13,705 --> 00:08:14,705
Take them?

110
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,519
This is not the first time
we've done this.

111
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,304
Trust me, no one will get hurt.

112
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:24,177
Could you pass me that, please?

113
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:29,469
Thank you.

114
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,027
I believe I have you
to thank for this, John.

115
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,250
- Me?
- A week ago, I couldn't move my toes...

116
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,444
But the minute you showed up,

117
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:46,863
I started to feel pins and needles.

118
00:08:47,957 --> 00:08:49,776
And this is only the beginning, John.

119
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,270
I can't wait to show you
what this island can do,

120
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:54,554
but unfortunately,

121
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:56,703
you're not ready, John.

122
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,769
- No, I'm ready.
- No, John, you're not.

123
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:05,079
You're still crippled
by the memories

124
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,962
of the man you used to be
before you came to this island,

125
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:09,855
and you'll never be free

126
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,859
until you release the hold
that your father has over you.

127
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,978
Why do you think you brought him here?

128
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:20,940
The magic box.

129
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,168
Okay, Ben,
how about you show me...

130
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,925
"magic box" is a metaphor, John.

131
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:27,531
I can't show you anything
until you can show me

132
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,586
that you're ready and willing
to be one of us.

133
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:33,527
When people join us here on this island,
they need to make a gesture

134
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:36,387
of free will, of commitment.

135
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,226
That's why you're gonna
have to kill your father.

136
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,359
When did you get back?

137
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:10,873
Last night.

138
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,432
Well, early this morning.

139
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,674
So... camping, huh?

140
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:18,627
What were you guys doing out there?

141
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:22,093
We... Figured
we'd explore a bit, you know.

142
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,208
See what was further down the beach.

143
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Male bonding.

144
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,208
Well, next time you go out,
sign me up.

145
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,881
Yeah, next time. Sure.

146
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,457
Thanks, Jin.

147
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:48,756
We have to tell Jack.

148
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,956
Yeah, I mean, shouldn't he
check out her wound?

149
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:53,438
Can you give me your word
that Jack can be trusted?

150
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,890
That he spent ten days with those people
and that nothing happened to him?

151
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,955
And that woman he's spending
all his time with...

152
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,657
- Juliet.
- Aye. Juliet.

153
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:03,106
Two weeks ago,
she had your friends in cages.

154
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:06,399
Naomi...

155
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:08,718
Well, you heard
everything that she said.

156
00:11:09,706 --> 00:11:10,817
If we keep her safe,

157
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,066
she's our way off this island.

158
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,172
So given that,

159
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:18,582
do you trust Jack,

160
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:20,759
or don't you?

161
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:26,332
Right.

162
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:29,818
So we better bring in
someone we can trust.

163
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,148
You should've put some shoes on.

164
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,620
You think?

165
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:46,343
So what else is in it?

166
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:48,496
In what?

167
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,579
The file they got on me.

168
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,244
Not much.

169
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,046
That your parents died
when you were very young.

170
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:00,408
But it doesn't say why

171
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,864
your father shot your mother...

172
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:09,181
Or why he turned the gun on himself.

173
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:17,030
That must've been hard for you.

174
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,119
What else?

175
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:30,725
High school transcripts...

176
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:32,495
criminal record...

177
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:35,410
all the con jobs you were arrested for.

178
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,194
I guess that's why
you use an alias, huh?

179
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:40,129
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

180
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,336
How stupid do you think I am?

181
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,319
I already been conned by Ben once.

182
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,992
Maybe you heard about it...
Bunny with a number painted on it?

183
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,275
You think I'm just gonna
follow you through the jungle?

184
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,302
Please, you have to...
You have to trust me.

185
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,226
Where are you taking me?
Tell me the truth!

186
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:55,265
What do you want from me?

187
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:57,686
I'm bringing you there
to do exactly what I said...

188
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,116
- To kill Ben.
- Why did you come back to get me?

189
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,592
- I had to.
- Why me?!

190
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:02,876
Why won't you do it yourself?

191
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,866
- James, please...
- Don't call me James!

192
00:13:05,432 --> 00:13:07,293
Why won't you do it yourself?

193
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,417
Because I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

194
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:16,449
That's why I came back for you.

195
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,369
Get up.

196
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:35,022
I'll go to wherever you got him,

197
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:37,211
but then we're bringing him
back to our camp.

198
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,436
I ain't killing nobody.
You understand me?

199
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,149
Yeah. I understand...

200
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,738
But you'll change your mind.

201
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,537
When you hear what he has to say,

202
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:57,233
you'll change your mind.

203
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,145
Hey, dude.

204
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,960
Hello, Hurley.

205
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,258
Can you keep a secret?

206
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:39,946
You've already spoken to her?

207
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,794
Yeah, but you're gonna
want to hear it for yourself.

208
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:44,601
And you haven't told Jack?

209
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,406
No.

210
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:47,845
Good.

211
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,669
My name's Sayid Jarrah.

212
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,444
I understand your helicopter
crashed onto the island.

213
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:06,483
Actually, it crashed in the water.

214
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,908
What's your name?

215
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:11,362
Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.

216
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,222
Naomi, from where exactly
did you take off?

217
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,529
A ship... freighter...

218
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:19,090
About 80 nautical miles west of here.

219
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,683
I'm part of a search and recovery team.

220
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:25,413
You told my friends the wreckage
of flight 815 was discovered.

221
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:27,501
Did you mean the partial wreckage?

222
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:31,571
No. They found the entire plane
off the coast of Bali,

223
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,638
in an ocean trench 4 miles deep.

224
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:37,923
They sent down cameras in these
little robots to survey the wreck.

225
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:40,242
The bodies were all there.

226
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,918
Well, obviously we're not dead.

227
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:48,346
Obviously.

228
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,133
So if you weren't looking for us,

229
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:51,963
then who were you looking for?

230
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:53,611
Him.

231
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:56,861
Desmond?

232
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,834
My company was hired by a woman
named Penelope Widmore.

233
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:01,857
I don't know why.
I never met her.

234
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,809
She gave us a set of coordinates.

235
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:07,739
We've been conducting a differential
G.P.S. grid search ever since.

236
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:10,180
You knew about the island?

237
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,482
Island?

238
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:14,562
We were given coordinates
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

239
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:17,798
We thought it was a fool's errand
till three days ago.

240
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:20,984
I was flying back for the ship,
when all of a sudden

241
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,929
the clouds cleared,
and I saw land.

242
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,278
The instruments started spinning.

243
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,860
I realized I was going down,

244
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,861
so I grabbed my chute,
and I bailed.

245
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,511
Did you actually see her helicopter?

246
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:38,298
No.

247
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:40,087
You think I'm lying, mate?

248
00:16:40,236 --> 00:16:41,985
I take it you have no means whatsoever

249
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:44,159
of communicating
with that freighter of yours?

250
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:48,390
What was your name? Sayid?

251
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Yes.

252
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,180
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

253
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:33,834
So Ben... you said I'd kill him
when I heard what he's got to say.

254
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:37,173
That's right.
Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

255
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:40,040
It's not really my place to tell you.

256
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:46,437
Look, what you read in that file...

257
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:49,367
about the guy in Sydney...

258
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:52,409
I thought he was someone else.

259
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,768
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to kill him.

260
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,410
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

261
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,407
Are we almost there?

262
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:12,039
Almost.

263
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:27,547
Wake up, John.

264
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:31,174
It's time.

265
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,686
I know it won't be easy,
but the quicker the better.

266
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,747
You're kidding me, right?

267
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:15,451
You expect him to kill me?

268
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,434
The hesitation that you're feeling
is just the part of you

269
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:26,370
that still feels like he has
a perfectly good explanation

270
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:27,714
for stealing your kidney,

271
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,432
throwing you
out of an 8-story window.

272
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:33,257
Don't you wanna be free from him?

273
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,635
The hesitation he's feeling
is because he is a spineless...

274
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:38,799
Shut up!

275
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:49,082
- I gotta think...
- Don't think, John.

276
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:50,910
You're wasting your time, bug-eye.

277
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,909
Me and him have been through all this.

278
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:56,131
- All he wants is his daddy...
- Shut up! I said shut up!

279
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:03,382
You really haven't
figured it out yet, have you?

280
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:08,016
Let go of him, John.

281
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,170
Why are you doing this to me?

282
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,796
You're doing this to yourself.
As long as he's still breathing,

283
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:19,210
you'll still be that
same sad, pathetic little man

284
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:21,537
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

285
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,249
because you couldn't walk.

286
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:52,078
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,
if you change your mind...

287
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,423
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:14,083
He's not who we thought he was.

289
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:07,673
Son of a...

290
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,394
Nice place you got here, Locke.

291
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:24,435
Ben's inside in the brig.

292
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:26,673
You ready?

293
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,172
Yeah, I'm ready.

294
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:52,703
Friends of yours?

295
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,722
It's an old slaving ship,
mid nineteenth century,

296
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:05,211
My guess is they...

297
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:08,840
captured the slaves and brought
them here to try and mine the island.

298
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,158
What's in the boxes?

299
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:15,603
That'd be dynamite.

300
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:22,927
Son of a bitch.

301
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,924
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

302
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:32,053
We ain't killin' him, Locke.

303
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,319
Whatever you say, James.

304
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:56,172
Well, well, well.

305
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,539
What are you doing?!
Open the damn door!

306
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:03,984
Shut up!

307
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:05,358
Open up!

308
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,085
I said shut up!

309
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,337
Who the hell are you?

310
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,610
- It's like a radio?
- It's like a radio, yes,

311
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:24,452
but I've never seen equipment
this sophisticated.

312
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,384
But you can still make it work, right?

313
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:27,527
I hope so.

314
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,101
And what about the other part?

315
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,493
The part about they found
the plane and we're all dead?

316
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:36,327
One thing at a time.

317
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,688
There's not a single audible channel.

318
00:24:46,003 --> 00:24:47,663
Whatever that interference is,

319
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:50,557
it's blocking our ability
to send our own transmission.

320
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,025
If we...

321
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:54,227
What's that?
Is that a radio?

322
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:56,957
Where'd you get it?

323
00:24:57,421 --> 00:24:58,491
Uh, the luggage.

324
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:01,066
What, you just found a radio
in the luggage?

325
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:05,507
Kate, if I explain,
I want you to keep this very quiet.

326
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,129
Keep what very quiet?

327
00:25:11,105 --> 00:25:13,750
Locke!
Open the damn door!

328
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:17,647
Open it up!
I can hear you, you bald bastard!

329
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:24,589
Rousseau?

330
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Locke.

331
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:30,843
What brings you to "the black rock"?

332
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,174
Dynamite. And you?

333
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:34,963
Open this door!

334
00:25:37,152 --> 00:25:38,152
Open up!

335
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,208
Crates are right over there.

336
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:49,137
Open this damn door!

337
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:50,846
Be careful. It's unstable.

338
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:14,217
It's beautiful, isn't it?

339
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:17,237
No matter how much time
you spend on the island,

340
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,903
you just never get tired of this view.

341
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:21,203
We haven't been
formally introduced.

342
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:22,276
I'm richard.

343
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,561
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, sure.

344
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:35,089
He wanted to embarrass you.

345
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:37,212
I'm sorry?

346
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,717
Ben knew you weren't
gonna kill your own father.

347
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,939
He put you in front
of everyone in our camp

348
00:26:44,028 --> 00:26:46,139
just so they could all watch you fail.

349
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:48,651
Why?

350
00:26:52,466 --> 00:26:53,910
'cause when word got back here

351
00:26:53,975 --> 00:26:56,525
that there was a man
with a broken spine on the plane

352
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:58,824
who could
suddenly walk again, well...

353
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:02,088
People here began to get very excited,
because that...

354
00:27:03,652 --> 00:27:06,582
That could only happen
to someone who was extremely special.

355
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:12,233
Now Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

356
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:14,158
And why are you telling me this?

357
00:27:15,881 --> 00:27:17,639
Ben has been wasting our time

358
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:20,775
with novelties like fertility problems.

359
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:24,037
We're looking for someone to remind us

360
00:27:24,123 --> 00:27:26,476
that we're here
for more important reasons.

361
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:29,677
What do you want from me?

362
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:33,329
I want for you to find your purpose,
and to do that,

363
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,025
your father has to go, John,

364
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:39,295
and since you're not going to do it...

365
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,441
I'm gonna suggest someone else.

366
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:53,966
Sawyer?

367
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,700
Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

368
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:58,899
Keep reading.

369
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:05,294
Open this damn door!

370
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,412
Son of a bitch!

371
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm pointin' my gun at you, John-boy.

372
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,598
You got three seconds
to open this door.

373
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,658
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

374
00:28:25,774 --> 00:28:26,774
One...

375
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:29,774
Two!

376
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:31,648
If there were any bullets in that gun,

377
00:28:31,714 --> 00:28:33,722
why would you hold a knife
to my throat?

378
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:39,677
Son of a bitch!

379
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:42,453
Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

380
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,440
What the hell's that mean?

381
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:48,187
It means that "bald-headed bastard"
outside the door is my son.

382
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:51,627
Come again?

383
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:55,022
My son,
as in I'm his father.

384
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:56,970
You do speak english?

385
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,438
How did you get here...
to the island?

386
00:29:06,138 --> 00:29:07,138
Island?

387
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:12,576
I'm driving down I-10
through Tallahassee, when bam...

388
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,218
Somebody slams
into the back of my car.

389
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:20,421
I go right into the divider
at 70 miles an hour.

390
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:21,737
The next thing I know,

391
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:23,930
the paramedics
are strapping me to a gurney,

392
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:25,576
stuffing me in the back of an ambulance,

393
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,913
and one of them
actually smiles at me

394
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:31,603
as he pops the I.V. In my arm,
and then... nothing.

395
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:33,972
Just black.

396
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:38,700
And the next thing I know,
I wake up in a dark room

397
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:41,596
tied up, gag in my mouth,
and when the door opens,

398
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:45,057
I'm looking up at the same man
I threw out a window...

399
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,034
John Locke,

400
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,924
my dead son.

401
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:02,237
And he's dead 'cause you
threw him out a window?

402
00:30:02,325 --> 00:30:04,213
No, he survived that,

403
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,452
but it paralyzed him,
permanently.

404
00:30:08,886 --> 00:30:12,336
He's dead because the plane
he was flying on crashed in the pacific.

405
00:30:16,404 --> 00:30:18,205
Well, I got bad news for you, pops,

406
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,555
'cause I was on that plane
with your son,

407
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:23,703
and he sure as hell wasn't crippled.

408
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:27,153
And we didn't crash in the pacific.
We crashed here on this island.

409
00:30:27,396 --> 00:30:28,803
You sure it's an island?

410
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:31,061
Well, what else is it?

411
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:33,052
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

412
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,633
Oh, okay, so we're dead.

413
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,549
They found your plane
on the bottom of the ocean.

414
00:30:43,205 --> 00:30:45,275
One minute I'm in a car wreck,
and the next minute

415
00:30:45,372 --> 00:30:47,417
I'm in a pirate ship
in the middle of the jungle?

416
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:49,189
If ts isn't hell, friend...

417
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,046
Then where are we?

418
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,458
Why did you throw Locke out a window?

419
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:02,250
He was becoming a nuisance.

420
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:07,498
I conned him into giving me
one of his kidneys.

421
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,005
He never got over it.

422
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:12,651
Conned?

423
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Yes, sir.

424
00:31:15,088 --> 00:31:16,088
Conned.

425
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,212
What's your name?

426
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,519
Your name?

427
00:31:27,268 --> 00:31:29,585
A con man
goes by many names, friend.

428
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:31,963
I've been Alan Seward,

429
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:36,132
Anthony Cooper, Ten McLaren, Tom Sawyer,

430
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,900
- Louis Jackson, Paul...
- Tom Sawyer?

431
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:42,881
I was young,
and "Huck Finn" was taken...

432
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:45,794
And the ladies loved that one.

433
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:47,453
Made me charming.

434
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,746
Well, how about that?

435
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:57,578
How about what?

436
00:32:00,864 --> 00:32:02,240
Sawyer's my name, too.

437
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:27,050
Ben, what's going on?

438
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,609
We're moving. Moving?
Where are we going?

439
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:32,459
We are not going anywhere, John.

440
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,622
You are going to stay behind.

441
00:32:34,989 --> 00:32:36,822
You both are going to stay behind.

442
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:39,851
What?
You're not taking him?

443
00:32:40,117 --> 00:32:42,819
He's your mess, John.
Why would we clean him up?

444
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,430
Ben, if you're trying to put me
in my place, or embarrass me...

445
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,960
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

446
00:32:49,237 --> 00:32:50,625
Well, you can't leave me.

447
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:53,818
- After everything, you can't just...
- Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

448
00:32:57,363 --> 00:32:59,430
But I thought I was... special.

449
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,279
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

450
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:09,425
We're leaving now.

451
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,439
We'll leave a trail...
one you can track. And, John,

452
00:33:14,864 --> 00:33:17,685
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

453
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:19,965
don't bother.

454
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:54,759
What's the matter with you?

455
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:58,706
You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?

456
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:01,987
Why?

457
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:04,126
Have you, or haven't you?

458
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,556
Yeah, I've been to Jasper.

459
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:10,599
Don't tell me I'm your daddy.

460
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,234
No.

461
00:34:15,357 --> 00:34:16,677
You killed my daddy.

462
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,233
Read it.

463
00:34:46,672 --> 00:34:48,339
"Dear Mr. Sawyer... "

464
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:53,247
- What is this?
- Just read it.

465
00:34:56,731 --> 00:35:00,788
"you don't know who I am,
but I know who you are,

466
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:03,616
"and I know what you done.

467
00:35:04,919 --> 00:35:06,490
"You had sex with my mother

468
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:10,512
"and then you stole
my dad's money all away,

469
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:14,298
so he got angry,
and he killed my mother... "

470
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,847
"and then he killed himself... "

471
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:24,741
So what?

472
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:28,290
Is this supposed to be you?
You wrote this letter?

473
00:35:30,038 --> 00:35:31,227
Hey, wait a second.

474
00:35:32,149 --> 00:35:33,415
Did you take my name

475
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,974
because you were
on some kind of revenge kick?

476
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,100
- Keep reading.
- Easy, easy.

477
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,479
Don't get all worked up.

478
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:46,872
Look, I ran that con two dozen times.

479
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:50,125
- If your mother was one of the...
- Mary.

480
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:53,779
Her name was Mary.

481
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,647
Mary from Jasper, Alabama.

482
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,767
Yeah, I remember her.

483
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:08,647
She practically begged me
to take her $38,000

484
00:36:08,854 --> 00:36:11,676
and to rescue her
from her sorry little life.

485
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,952
You finish the letter.

486
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:17,304
Look, I only took her money.

487
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,020
It ain't my fault your dad overreacted.

488
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:22,420
If he pulled the old murder-suicide,

489
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,409
then I'm sure he's down here somewhere.

490
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,351
Maybe you could take this up with him.

491
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:27,532
Finish it!

492
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:47,492
You wanna go to hell?

493
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:49,767
You wanna go to hell?!

494
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:40,603
Thank you.

495
00:37:46,562 --> 00:37:48,222
You missing those cheeseburgers yet?

496
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,458
Only every second.

497
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,466
I need to talk to you.

498
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:01,437
- In private.
- No problem.

499
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:03,901
Anything you wanna say to me,
you can say in front of her.

500
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:04,995
Not this.

501
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,840
- It's okay.
- No, no. You can stay.

502
00:38:10,281 --> 00:38:11,925
Yeah, you know what?
You should stay.

503
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:14,803
Seems only fair, considering
that she's the reason

504
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,689
no one wants to tell you
that there's a woman

505
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,608
in Hurley's tent who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

506
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:21,271
- What?
- A woman.

507
00:38:21,404 --> 00:38:23,292
She jumped from her chopper
before it crashed.

508
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,155
She says that the boat
that she took off from

509
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,696
is about 80 miles off the coast
and that if she can find a way

510
00:38:27,736 --> 00:38:29,313
to contact it, we'll all be rescued.

511
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:30,782
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

512
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,951
I already told you...
because they don't trust you.

513
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,430
How?

514
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:47,428
How what?

515
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:49,116
How is she supposed to contact her boat?

516
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:50,527
Did you hear what I just said?

517
00:38:50,654 --> 00:38:53,580
Hurley, Charlie, Sayid,
your friends, are afraid to...

518
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:56,057
How?

519
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:03,654
She had a phone-radio thing.

520
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:05,738
Sayid's trying to get it to work.

521
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,128
We should tell her.

522
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:15,226
- No.
- Tell me what?

523
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:17,719
- We should tell her.
- Not yet.

524
00:39:43,243 --> 00:39:44,488
You can go back now.

525
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,294
Why did you do this?

526
00:39:50,494 --> 00:39:53,580
He ruined my life,
and he ruined yours.

527
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:59,220
And he had it coming.

528
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:05,565
Juliet is a mole.

529
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:08,329
- What?
- She's working for Ben.

530
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,548
He sent her back to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

531
00:40:11,603 --> 00:40:13,949
Three days from now, there's
gonna be a raid on the beach,

532
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,197
and they're gonna take them.

533
00:40:15,307 --> 00:40:17,538
They say they don't want
anyone to get hurt.

534
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,825
Well, why are you telling me?

535
00:40:21,304 --> 00:40:23,891
- So you can warn the camp.
- You warn the camp.

536
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:26,861
I'm not going back.

537
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:29,547
You're going back undercover?

538
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,942
No, I was never undercover, James.

539
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:35,749
I'm on my own journey now.

540
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:41,204
Even if Juliet is a mole,
they ain't gonna believe me.

541
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,987
I been saying that since she showed up.

542
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:47,245
They'll believe you now.

543
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:56,743
Is it true?

544
00:40:58,679 --> 00:40:59,679
Is what true?

545
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:02,075
That he threw you out a window...

546
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,763
That you were a cripple?

547
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,679
Not anymore.
