<i>Previously on</i> Lost<i>...</i>

2
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:03,597
Desmond said I was gonna die.

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,374
He told me he has
these flashes... visions.

4
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:09,611
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,
you were electrocuted.

5
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:11,498
And when you heard
Claire was in the water,

6
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:14,453
you drowned trying to save her.
I dove in myself, so you never went in.

7
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:16,099
No matter what I try to do,

8
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:17,652
you're gonna die, Charlie.

9
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,128
There's a woman in Hurley's tent

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,118
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,208
She says that the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast,

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,300
and if she can find a way to contact it,
we'll all be rescued.

13
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:28,728
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

14
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:30,419
Because they don't trust you.

15
00:00:30,774 --> 00:00:31,859
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

16
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:33,014
Where'd you get that?

17
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:35,461
You really think
you're in a position to ask questions?

18
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:37,503
I told Jack what they were making me do.

19
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:38,949
Why didn't you tell us?

20
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,549
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

21
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,873
Anyone wants to venture a guess

22
00:01:18,998 --> 00:01:21,836
as to what Jack's gonna be showing us
out in the middle of nowhere?

23
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:23,627
I don't know. Stuff.

24
00:01:24,772 --> 00:01:25,994
Probably secret stuff.

25
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,900
Why does everything
have to be such a secret?

26
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,883
How about some openness
for a change?

27
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,592
We kept the parachute lady secret.

28
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:34,880
Ah, that's different.

29
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,025
Different how?

30
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,316
Well, because we weren't out there
playing football with them.

31
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:40,714
What?

32
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,086
Nothing.

33
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,212
Wait.

34
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,761
You had one of your flashes
again, didn't you?

35
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,746
No, Charlie, I didn't.

36
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:54,397
We're here.

37
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,196
A couple of nights ago,

38
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,197
Juliet came to me,
and she told me everything...

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,507
That Ben had sent her here to find out
which of our women were pregnant.

40
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,371
So what, you guys
were doing tests on us?

41
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,816
No, but that's what he wanted me to do.

44
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,357
They're coming tomorrow.

45
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,511
Sun, I'm sorry that I lied to you.

46
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,477
While I appreciate your honesty, Jack,

47
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,084
it doesn't explain
why you brought us out here.

48
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:52,274
Show 'em.

49
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,049
When Juliet told me they where coming,

50
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:18,610
the first thing I thought was,

51
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:21,357
where the hell
are we gonna hide this time?

52
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,367
But hiding's pointless.

53
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,397
They're just gonna keep coming back.

54
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:28,259
So I went out, and I found some help.

55
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,389
And for the past few days,

56
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,810
she's been bringing dynamite
back from "the black rock."

57
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,539
For the very first time,

58
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,806
we know exactly what they want,
when they're coming to get it,

59
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,779
and they have no idea

60
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:42,438
that we're gonna be waiting for 'em.

61
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,909
So Juliet's gonna mark the tents
with the white rocks,

62
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,223
just like she was told to,

63
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,053
but there's not gonna be
any pregnant women inside.

64
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,391
There's gonna be plenty
of what we used on that tree.

65
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,838
So tomorrow night...

66
00:03:58,228 --> 00:03:59,228
We stop hiding.

67
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,712
We stop running.

68
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,945
We stop living in fear of them,
because when they show up...

69
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,060
we're gonna blow 'em all to hell.

70
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:22,382
Subtitles: swsub.com

71
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,208
Bloody hell!

72
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,272
Why are we even doing this?

73
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:35,394
Chin up, mate.

74
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,458
- We're headlining.
- Headlining?

75
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:39,292
We're playing Clitheroe...

76
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,773
The arse end of nowhere.

77
00:04:40,895 --> 00:04:41,895
A gig's a gig.

78
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:43,506
We're building our fan base.

79
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:46,084
Will our fan base pay
for a new sodding tire?

80
00:04:46,398 --> 00:04:47,636
Only if we show up.

81
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,551
So let's just get on with it, shall we?

82
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,629
You know what, Liam?

83
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,949
You get on with it.

84
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,145
I quit.

85
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,942
- You're giving up?
- There's nothing to give up on!

86
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,330
We're broke! The album's not selling!
We're a bloody joke!

87
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:02,519
Hey, shut it!

88
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,771
Listen.

89
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,005
That's us.

90
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,607
We're on the radio!

91
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,338
That we are.

92
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,250
We're on the bloody radio!

93
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:29,177
I told you, baby brother!

94
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,945
We're gonna be bloody rock stars.

95
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,443
Can I ask you something?

96
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:45,016
Who are you people
about to go to war with?

97
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:47,316
Oh, that's a long story.

98
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:48,924
Want to ask me something else?

99
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:50,774
You having a laugh?

100
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:52,685
Of course not.

101
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:55,013
I'd never disrespect a fellow Mancunian.

102
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:58,114
- You're from Manchester, then?
- I am.

103
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:01,173
My band got its start at
the night and day bar on Oldham street.

104
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,816
- What band?
- We were called Drive Shaft.

105
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:06,212
Yeah. Yeah, I know you.

106
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,336
We had our moment in the sun.

107
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,866
No, not that... the crash.

108
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,531
You're the dead rock star.

109
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,063
They made a big deal out of you
when they found the plane.

110
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,224
Huge memorial service, new album.

111
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,411
There's a new album?

112
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,304
Yeah. God, it was everywhere...

113
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:20,816
A "greatest hits" thing.

114
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,448
Hey, look on the bright side.

115
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,433
You're not really dead, right?

116
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,314
Yeah, right.

117
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:58,581
We need more wire,

118
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,559
so we can trigger these
from a safe distance.

119
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,897
I can get people to start
stripping the plane wreckage.

120
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,768
Good. I should be able
to finish rigging these tents

121
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:08,177
in the next 24 hours.

122
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:10,385
We'll be ready by tomorrow night.

123
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,917
We need to talk about Naomi's phone.

124
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,809
- Not now.
- If you're angry I doubted you,

125
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:21,955
I'd be happy to make
a sincere apology later,

126
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,844
- but now we have a means...
- Look, I'm a little bit busy right now.

127
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:27,327
And I am trying to get us
off this island!

128
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:32,722
I can't transmit using this phone

129
00:07:32,844 --> 00:07:35,625
because Danielle's distress signal
is overriding the frequency.

130
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:38,628
If you tell me where the radio tower is,

131
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,243
I can go there, switch off
your message and call for help.

132
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,833
My signal has been playing
for the last 16 years,

133
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,101
and nobody has heard it.

134
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,004
Why do you think
you'll have better luck?

135
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:50,451
Naomi's boat is only 80 miles offshore.

136
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:53,833
I know if we eliminate
Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.

137
00:07:53,878 --> 00:07:54,940
No, they won't.

138
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,750
And why is that?

139
00:07:57,838 --> 00:07:58,882
We're jamming it.

140
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:00,308
What?

141
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,060
Ben is using one of the Dharma stations

142
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:04,599
to block all of the signals off
of the island except for ours.

143
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:05,625
What station?

144
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,604
They call it the "Looking Glass."

145
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:09,736
- The looking glass?
- Yes.

146
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,013
But it's underwater.
I have no idea where it is.

147
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,375
I believe I do.

148
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,504
Look, I know...
I know Jack thinks it's best,

149
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,120
but, you know, what if
they're coming for him again?

150
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:25,792
Claire, listen to me.

151
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,847
I'm gonna protect you.

152
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:29,833
I'm gonna protect Aaron.

153
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,376
I promise.

154
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,265
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

155
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:41,359
Sorry.

156
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,195
Can you give me a hand with something?

157
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:48,759
Of course.

158
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:04,122
So you ready to tell me
what you saw this morning?

159
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:05,937
Aye.

160
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,481
Right. So how does it happen this time?

161
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,439
Come on, Des!

162
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,514
You can tell me. I can take it.

163
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,178
What I saw, Charlie, was...

164
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,980
Claire and her baby
getting into a helicopter...

165
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:29,227
A helicopter that...

166
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:33,540
That lifts off, leaves this island.

167
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:40,801
You sure?

168
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:42,367
Aye.

169
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:43,978
Rescue helicopter...

170
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,551
On this beach?

171
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:47,357
This island? That's what you saw?

172
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,412
We're getting bloody rescued!

173
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:54,341
I thought you were gonna tell me
I was gonna die again.

174
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:00,739
You are, Charlie.

175
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,301
Wait. What?

176
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:07,050
If you don't...

177
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,499
none of it will happen.

178
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:12,965
There won't be any rescue.

179
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:17,558
I'm sorry, brother...

180
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:19,828
but this time...

181
00:10:22,947 --> 00:10:24,547
This time you have to die.

182
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,253
Come on!

183
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:40,892
Come on, Charlie. Jump in!

184
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,884
I'm gonna catch you, boy.

185
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,066
No. You're just going to back away.

186
00:10:46,272 --> 00:10:47,960
Don't be daft. Jump in!

187
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,107
I promise, Charlie. I'm gonna catch you.

188
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:54,436
No, he won't!

189
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,148
Zip it, you.

190
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:59,359
Look, don't listen to your brother.

191
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:00,834
Just jump on in.

192
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,980
There's nothing to be afraid of,
Charlie.

193
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:09,699
I'll catch you. I promise.

194
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:34,083
I did it!

195
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:36,608
You got it!

196
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,301
- I did it.
- You're swimming, Charlie.

197
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,003
What you writing?

198
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:57,957
Nothing.

199
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:06,762
All right, tell me.

200
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:11,560
Are you sure you want to know?

201
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:15,531
I mean, it might be easier
if you just...

202
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:18,374
I want to know.

203
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:23,491
You're inside a hatch.

204
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:24,925
It's...

205
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,801
a room full of equipment.

206
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:30,416
There's a blinking yellow light

207
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,121
above a switch.

208
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,024
You flip the switch.

209
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,291
Light goes off.

210
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,530
And then you drown.

211
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,290
When?

212
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:01,851
I don't know.

213
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:04,686
You're sure you saw Claire and Aaron
get on that helicopter?

214
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:05,976
Aye.

215
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:09,728
So...

216
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,932
before I... drown...

217
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,547
I just have to flip a switch?

218
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:20,736
That's right.

219
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:26,415
Where is it, then?

220
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,456
Now this is the Looking Glass.

221
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:34,675
It's an underwater Dharma station.

222
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,101
Please, can you tell me anything
you might know about this place?

223
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,646
I've never been down there.

224
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,412
I don't know anyone who has.

225
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
Why not?

226
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:45,136
There was some accident.

227
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:47,973
Ben told us that the station
was completely flooded.

228
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,156
Well, if it's flooded,
then how does it still work?

229
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:51,808
How it still works is irrelevant.

230
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:54,255
The question is, how do
we get it to stop working,

231
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,113
so we could use the satellite phone?

232
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:00,623
The diagram shows
that the looking glass

233
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,636
is connected to the island by a cable.

234
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:05,269
I feel sure that this is
the very same cable

235
00:14:05,414 --> 00:14:07,455
down the beach
which runs into the ocean.

236
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:10,566
So if we follow the cable,
it should lead us to the station.

237
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,373
So how are we gonna get in?

238
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,674
We swim in.

239
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,155
There's a moon pool...

240
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,700
A room with an open floor
at the base of the station...

241
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,839
Big enough
for a submarine to dock.

242
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,688
Even if the station's flooded,

243
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,814
I think I'll be able to find
the relay switch and disable it.

244
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:27,549
What about swimming back out?

245
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,924
No. I'm not letting you
go on some suicide mission

246
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:34,300
just to flip the switch.

247
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,751
Someone has to do it,
or we'll never leave this island.

248
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:37,929
I'll do it.

249
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,875
I can swim down, turn off that
bloody switch, swim back up.

250
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:41,954
Piece of cake.

251
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,193
Charlie, you don't even know
what we're talking about.

252
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:46,464
I was junior swim champion
in northern England.

253
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,990
I can hold my breath for 4 minutes.

254
00:14:48,058 --> 00:14:49,840
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

255
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:56,711
No, and there's no reason
to do this now.

256
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:59,311
We're gonna focus on the others,
and then we'll deal with this.

257
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,713
Wait a minute.
We have a chance to signal for a rescue.

258
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,409
Look, for 90 days, I've been asked
to make decisions for this entire camp.

259
00:15:06,097 --> 00:15:07,754
There you go.
I just made one.

260
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:18,926
Rose, that's a sailor's hitch.

261
00:15:19,493 --> 00:15:22,197
It's not gonna hold.
You wanna do a sheet bend like mine.

262
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,934
Oh, so now you're a knot expert.

263
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:25,949
Well, trust me, it's...

264
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,164
How did you do that?

265
00:15:33,095 --> 00:15:34,503
Watch and learn, dear.

266
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,968
Look there!
Look!

267
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:00,163
Get off him, damn it!
It's okay.

268
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,156
- What? He's one of them!
- I know! It's okay.

269
00:17:04,965 --> 00:17:06,361
He was in the cage next to me.

270
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,428
I know this guy.

271
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,697
What the hell are you doing here, Karl?

272
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,996
They're... coming...

273
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,972
My people.

274
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,597
Sorry you came all this way for nothing,
but we already know.

275
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:18,962
Then why are you still here?

276
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,918
'cause when they'll show up tomorrow
night, we're gonna be ready for 'em.

277
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,970
Tomorrow? No, no,
they're coming tonight.

278
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:33,368
They're coming right now!

279
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:41,601
SIX HOURS AGO (del vo)

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,222
When did you get back?

281
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,505
Just now.

282
00:17:50,752 --> 00:17:51,752
Where's Locke?

283
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,965
Here's your gun back.

284
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,388
Ben, what's going on?

285
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,441
Where's Ryan?

286
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,294
He's in his tent. Are you...

287
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:06,690
It's time to get them.

288
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,354
But you said tomorrow.

289
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,176
Jacob wants it to happen now.

290
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,348
Look, what happened out there?

291
00:18:13,378 --> 00:18:15,152
- Did john see...
- John had an accident.

292
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,003
Ryan?

293
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:20,127
Yes, sir?

294
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,629
If you leave right now,

295
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,605
how long will it take you
to reach their camp?

296
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,928
Well, if I take my ten best,
we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall.

297
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,095
- Then you better get going.
- No, Ben, wait.

298
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:30,349
Moving up the schedule...

299
00:18:30,418 --> 00:18:32,631
Juliet may not be ready.
What if she hasn't had time...

300
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:34,391
Then we'll take all their women...

301
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:38,014
And we'll sort out
the ones we need later.

302
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,673
And the men?

303
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,288
If any of 'em are stupid enough
to get in your way,

304
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:43,939
kill 'em.

305
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:45,935
All right.

306
00:18:58,336 --> 00:18:59,392
Karl!

307
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
It's me!

308
00:19:06,243 --> 00:19:07,628
I thought you were bringing rabbit.

309
00:19:07,674 --> 00:19:09,717
You have to go... now.

310
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,113
What? Did he find out I was out here?

311
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,692
No, but he's sending Pryce
to their beach camp right now,

312
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,911
and you have to warn them.

313
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,342
- Warn them?
- You have to go now!

314
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:19,605
I thought they were just gonna
take the pregnant women.

315
00:19:19,635 --> 00:19:20,661
If you take the outrigger,

316
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,359
you'll get there
a few hours before them.

317
00:19:22,714 --> 00:19:25,066
- Wait, Alex...
- He's gonna kill them Karl!

318
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,779
Austen and Ford saved your life.

319
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:35,691
You owe them.

320
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:40,853
You better take this.

321
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,263
If I get caught, your father's
gonna kill me this time.

322
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:47,542
Is he my father?

323
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,318
Now go.

324
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:25,628
Is that everything?

325
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:29,951
Can we trust him?

326
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,338
You don't trust me?

327
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:32,543
What about her?

328
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:34,126
She's a spy.

329
00:20:35,323 --> 00:20:38,491
She's supposed to mark the tents
of the pregnant women with white rocks

330
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:41,118
- so they can take them.
- They know, Karl, but thanks.

331
00:20:43,057 --> 00:20:45,498
- So what are we gonna do?
- We have to leave now... Hide.

332
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,673
Where? It's their island.
f they wanna kill us, they'll find us.

333
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,764
The sun's gonna go down in a few hours.

334
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,540
- Do we have enough wire yet?
- Not even close.

335
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,318
We have to find out another way
to set the dynamite off.

336
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,231
- We can shoot.
- We don't have enough guns.

337
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:01,608
Ten of them are coming, armed.

338
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,161
Not the others... the tents.

339
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:05,418
We can camouflage the dynamite
next to the tents,

340
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,830
target it from our positions
at the tree line.

341
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,516
Juliet marked three tents.
That means we need three guns.

342
00:21:14,036 --> 00:21:15,863
Here. You can have mine, too.

343
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:19,076
I'll be your third.

344
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,921
I'll take your gun,
but you're not staying here.

345
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,918
You're gonna lead everyone
to the radio tower... Everyone.

346
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:29,101
The radio tower?

347
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:31,382
If this doesn't work,
we can't risk losing the chance

348
00:21:31,504 --> 00:21:33,116
of getting in contact with Naomi's boat,

349
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:35,377
so everything has to happen
at the same time.

350
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:41,847
You still up for a swim?

351
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,369
Yeah, I believe I am.

352
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,515
I'll go with him.

353
00:21:50,702 --> 00:21:52,935
Okay, better get to it.

354
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:10,796
It's here, baby brother.

355
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:12,140
Christmas is here.

356
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:17,127
Are these the birds from row two?

357
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,308
Well done, mate.

358
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:27,982
Well, as you have spent another year

359
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:31,180
as the only drug-free
rock star in the world,

360
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:33,626
I'm gonna share
a little-known fact with you.

361
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:39,667
Father christmas lives
just down the street from here.

362
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:41,460
Father christmas lives in Helsinki?

363
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:42,762
Indeed he does,

364
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,791
and in case you haven't noticed,
baby brother,

365
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,198
Finland is the bloody north pole.

366
00:22:49,872 --> 00:22:53,709
Therefore, I have a very special
gift for you this year.

367
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,767
Liam, no. Mum gave you that.

368
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,210
You're the firstborn.

369
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,493
It was her father's
and his father before that.

370
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,934
And it's a family heirloom,
and at's why we named the band

371
00:23:09,075 --> 00:23:10,261
after Dexter bloody Stratton.

372
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:11,453
I know.

373
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:13,755
But, Charlie, let's be honest.

374
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:17,355
We both know I'm a sodding mess.

375
00:23:17,889 --> 00:23:19,875
But you... You're different.

376
00:23:20,285 --> 00:23:22,484
You're gonna get married,
have a family...

377
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:24,554
A baby.

378
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,288
I'll be lucky if I hit 30.

379
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,534
Don't say that, Lee.

380
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,680
The ring has to stay
in the family, Charlie.

381
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,204
So, please...

382
00:23:35,765 --> 00:23:36,765
Take it.

383
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,856
Mum would have wanted it this way.

384
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,490
Pass it on to your little one someday.

385
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,883
I need to know it's safe.

386
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:53,365
I'll hold on to it...

387
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,815
but I won't take it.

388
00:24:01,737 --> 00:24:03,577
Hey, it fits. Look at that.

389
00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:07,410
Happy christmas, baby brother.

390
00:24:39,204 --> 00:24:40,249
You need some help?

391
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:44,278
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna do this?

392
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,382
I didn't want you to worry.

393
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:54,520
Well, it's dangerous, isn't it,

394
00:24:54,664 --> 00:24:56,663
swimming into some underwater station?

395
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,235
It's what needs to be done
to get us all rescued.

396
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,996
I'll be fine, Claire.

397
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,979
But you gotta promise me something.

398
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:09,766
While I'm gone...

399
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,529
Don't worry about me.

400
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:28,847
I'll take him.

401
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:32,782
Thanks.

402
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,777
Alright, turnip head.

403
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,454
Now you take care of your mum

404
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:46,689
while I'm away, okay?

405
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:57,593
I love you.

406
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:18,437
See you soon.

407
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,580
Be careful, Charlie.

408
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:25,908
Okay?

409
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:20,326
Sorry, guys.

410
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:21,756
Thanks, man.

411
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,282
Help! Help me!

412
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,003
Please!

413
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:42,224
You, stop!

414
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,586
Get the hell away from her!

415
00:27:45,614 --> 00:27:46,617
What are you doing?

416
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:47,739
Leave her alone!

417
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,990
You okay, miss?

418
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:54,536
Yes. I think so, yes.

419
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:57,927
Here you go.

420
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:01,116
Pardon me while I have a heart attack.

421
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:03,472
The last time I was in a fight,
I was 8 years old.

422
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,739
And I lost.

423
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:12,362
Well, that makes you even more
of a hero, doesn't it?

424
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:14,722
I just did what anyone would do.

425
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,772
Three people walked by the alley.

426
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,903
- What?
- They saw me,

427
00:28:20,653 --> 00:28:22,060
but they just kept on going.

428
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,332
You are a hero, sir...

429
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:30,985
And don't let anyone ever
tell you differently.

430
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,074
- What's that?
- It's a weight belt.

431
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:51,960
It should bring you down
quicker than swimming.

432
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:54,876
Well, every second counts.

433
00:28:56,678 --> 00:28:58,680
So I just take it off when I hit bottom,

434
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:00,956
swim up through the moon pool,

435
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:02,494
into the station,

436
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,258
swim into whichever room
has the yellow blinking switch,

437
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,835
flip it.

438
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:13,235
Nothing to it.

439
00:29:17,934 --> 00:29:21,029
So how long
can you really hold your breath for?

440
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,240
Does it matter?

441
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,876
- Do you want me to hit another one?
- No, you've made your point.

442
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:38,168
Bernard, this is not pheasant hunting
in Montgomery county.

443
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,923
- I know what I'm doing.
- No.

444
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,998
- Pheasants don't shoot back.
- Nothing's gonna happen to me, Rose.

445
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:46,550
I just have to shoot a tent,
and I'll be right behind you.

446
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,200
Then I'm staying, too.

447
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,167
No, you're not, Rose.

448
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:54,674
Everyone's gathering down
at the south end of the beach.

449
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,936
No one's staying behind
but the shooters.

450
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,189
Says who? You wanna give me your word

451
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:02,219
that nothing's gonna happen
to my husband, then I'll go.

452
00:30:04,432 --> 00:30:06,543
I'll give you my word
that if we don't kill everyone

453
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:08,426
who shows up here in about an hour,

454
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,622
it's not gonna matter where Bernard is.

455
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,241
I like you better
since you got back, Jack.

456
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:16,140
You're almost an optimist.

457
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:19,358
Come on.
If you're gonna be hiding in the bushes,

458
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,122
let's get you into somethin' dark.

459
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,396
You better get going.

460
00:30:27,106 --> 00:30:29,565
Rousseau says it's about
a day's walk up to the radio tower.

461
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,958
I'm not taking them to the tower.
You are.

462
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:36,418
- Excuse me?
- You're not staying behind.

463
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,942
This was my idea.

464
00:30:39,064 --> 00:30:40,804
And I'm perfectly capable
of executing it.

465
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:43,247
- I owe them!
- What are you more concerned with,

466
00:30:43,912 --> 00:30:46,875
killing the others
or getting our people off this island?

467
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,698
This afternoon,
you said you were our leader.

468
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,298
It's time for you to act like one.

469
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:05,160
Lead them to the radio tower, Jack...

470
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,863
and then take us all home.

471
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:21,791
Dudes, wait!

472
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,030
I heard what you're doing.
I wanna come with.

473
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:35,243
Everyone...
They're all going to the radio tower,

474
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,820
and I'm sick of trekking and,
you know, explosions.

475
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:43,032
I think I can help you guys out.

476
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:45,480
I'm a really good paddler.

477
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:53,145
You can't go, Hurley.

478
00:31:55,024 --> 00:31:56,106
Why not?

479
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:59,669
Because...

480
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:03,364
you're too big.

481
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,094
You won't fit in the boat.

482
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,159
That's uncool, man.

483
00:32:18,184 --> 00:32:19,319
Wait.

484
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:26,555
Dude, it's fine. I don't even
wanna go on your stupid boat.

485
00:32:32,837 --> 00:32:34,211
I'll catch up with you later.

486
00:32:35,218 --> 00:32:36,421
Just remember I love you, man.

487
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,946
Yeah, whatever. I love you, too.

488
00:32:54,969 --> 00:32:56,659
You got water in there? Good, good.

489
00:32:57,248 --> 00:32:58,611
How about you? Bottled water?

490
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:00,080
Good.

491
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:05,923
So here we go again, huh?

492
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:08,814
Here we go again.

493
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,197
The tents are all marked. We're set.

494
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:16,616
Sayid find the third shooter?

495
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:30,128
Ready, Claire?
Need a hand with the little guy?

496
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:31,981
No, thanks. I'm okay.

497
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,257
How's my little sweetheart?

498
00:33:44,627 --> 00:33:47,518
We're just gonna go for a little walk,
so hold onto mum, okay?

499
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:12,862
This is it!

500
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:21,986
Ready?

501
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,604
Do you want a blanket?

502
00:35:39,214 --> 00:35:40,532
Oh, thanks. I've got one.

503
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,229
Well, you're warming for two.

504
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:44,675
Take mine.

505
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:48,088
Thank you.

506
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,672
So... first plane crash?

507
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:02,113
What gave it away?

508
00:36:02,713 --> 00:36:04,666
Ah, you can always spot the newbies.

509
00:36:09,894 --> 00:36:11,506
We're gonna be okay, you know.

510
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,612
Are we?

511
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:16,549
We're alive.

512
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:18,927
We're on a beautiful island.

513
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:21,487
We'll sleep under the stars,

514
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:24,882
and before you know it, the helicopters
will come and take us all home.

515
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:28,396
You really think they'll find us?

516
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:31,235
Well, yeah. Why wouldn't they?

517
00:36:34,253 --> 00:36:35,349
Thanks.

518
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,885
I'm Charlie.

519
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,310
I'm Claire.

520
00:36:40,947 --> 00:36:42,264
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

521
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:43,937
It's nice to meet you.

522
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:06,856
We're here.

523
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:19,529
I want you to give this
to Claire for me.

524
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:27,234
What is it?

525
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,425
It's the five best moments of my...

526
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:37,643
sorry excuse for a life.

527
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,358
My greatest hits.

528
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:49,355
You know...

529
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:53,983
memories...

530
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:56,918
are all I've got.

531
00:37:59,336 --> 00:38:00,518
You don't have to do this.

532
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,346
What?

533
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:06,355
I'll go.

534
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,113
No, your... Your flashes...

535
00:38:09,325 --> 00:38:10,330
Maybe...

536
00:38:11,192 --> 00:38:13,211
I keep seeing you die because...

537
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:17,456
I'm supposed to take your place.

538
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:24,585
What about your girl...

539
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:26,544
Penny?

540
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:29,974
What about your girl?

541
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,794
Besides...

542
00:38:40,178 --> 00:38:41,549
I might be luckier than you.

543
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,540
Keep your memories to yourself.

544
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:58,868
I'll take it from here.

545
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,231
I don't know what to say.

546
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:14,535
Well, you can tell me where the,
the weight belt is.

547
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,158
Right there behind you.

548
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:44,786
You and I both know...

549
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,020
You aren't supposed
to take my place, brother.

550
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,045
I'm alive.
