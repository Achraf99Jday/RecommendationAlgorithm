1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,960
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,530
beach camp's right over there.

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,090
Can you get me some clothes?

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,910
What happened to yours?

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,760
I woke up in the jungle like this.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,390
F.Y.I., The whole island vibrated,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,620
and kate and jack and sawyer saw it, too,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,290
right before they had bags pulled over their heads.

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,870
Don't worry.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,830
Locke's gonna go after them.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,030
He said so in his speech.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,420
What speech?

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,410
I'm gonna find our friends.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,080
We're gonna find 'em-- all of them.

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,430
I don't know how yet, but I will.

16
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,350
You've, um...you've got a problem with your roof.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,110
The roof?

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,380
dude, I don't know about this.

19
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,290
See, you're looking at this all wrong.

20
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,000
He would want us to do this.

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,250
He'd want us to ransack his tent and take his stash?

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,160
Yeah, that sounds exactly like sawyer.

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,230
Yeah, well, he stole all this in the first place.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,290
I mean, people need food.

25
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,680
They need medical supplies.

26
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,530
They need...

27
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,300
shocking amounts of pornography.

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,300
Charlie.

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,080
Oh.Desmondo.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,470
I need you to come with me.

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,530
You guys find eko?

32
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,540
Both of you.

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,200
What happened?

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,210
eko is dead.

35
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,130
We found his body in the jungle...

36
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,850
buried him yesterday.

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,190
How did he die?

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,390
The island killed him.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,830
What do you mean, the island killed him?

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,030
What do you mean, the island killed him?

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,140
you know what it means.

44
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,050
They're gonna look to you two to see how to react.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,060
So when I tell everyone what happened, I need you to help keep things calm.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,360
Dude, you okay?

47
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,820
Hey, guys, what's wrong with desmond?

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,130
What is he doing?

49
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,600
There's someone else out there.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,980
Where's claire?

51
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,320
She just went for a walk.

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,140
I offered to watch the baby.

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,550
Claire!

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,090
- I've got her.
- Is she okay?

55
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,720
I've got her.

56
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,970
Claire!

57
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,970
What happened?!

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,490
Look, stand back.Just give me some room.

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,360
Claire!Claire!

60
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,980
Get back, charlie.I know what I'm doing.

61
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,180
Is she breathing?

62
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,860
She's not breathing?

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,220
Come on.

64
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,780
Do you want me to help you?

65
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,410
Come on.Claire?

66
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,830
Come on.Claire...

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,490
oh, claire!Cough it up.

68
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,180
you all right?

69
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on.Claire.

70
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,190
Okay, let's get you back to your tent.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,130
It's all right, charlie.

72
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,140
Let's get her back to the tent.

73
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,100
Is she okay?

74
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,220
Let me help.

75
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,500
- I've got her, charlie.
- I'll take her.

76
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,470
where are you going?

77
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,670
Hey, how did you know?

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,150
How did you know she was drowning?

79
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,730
I'll tell you how he knew.

80
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,320
That guy...

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,330
sees the future, dude.

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,130
She's beautiful.

86
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,860
Aye.

87
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,830
Thanks.

88
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,510
What's her name?

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Penny--uh, penelop

90
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,040
how are you feeling?

91
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,660
Still a little shaken up.

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,480
I mean, I go swimming almost every day, and...

93
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,900
the undertow just grabbed me.

94
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,460
I mean, if...

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,230
you know, if you hadn'T...

96
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,320
claire?

97
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,500
I thought you were only gonna be five minutes.Aaron's starving.

98
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,700
Yeah, um...sorry.

99
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,890
anyway, I just really wanted to say...

100
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,280
thank you.

101
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,770
Thank you so much...

102
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,770
for being there.

103
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,350
It was my pleasure.

104
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,100
Locke doesn't know about anything except knives and fishing.

105
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,960
There's nothing to know.

106
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,450
I don't buy this precognitive insanity rubbish.

107
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,550
Look, if the bearded wonder could predict the future,

108
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,660
he wouldn't have ended up here, would he?

109
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,340
Well, whatever happened to him, we're gonna have to find out what it is.

110
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,710
You do realize he's gonna know your plan before you even come up with it, dude.

111
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,510
In that case...

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,520
we're gonna have to get him really bloody drunk.

113
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,120
Beautiful evening.

114
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,660
- Aye.
- Say it, dude.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
This morning...

116
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,020
I'm sorry I wasn't more...grateful.

117
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,360
Thank you for helping claire not drown.

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,470
No harm done.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,520
Excellent.

120
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,530
Brought a peace offering.

121
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,160
You know, make the truce official.

122
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,950
Thanks, but no.

123
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,860
I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk as of late.

124
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,730
Too good for us, brother?

125
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,420
All right, that's fine.

126
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,950
We'll take our drink and go somewhere else.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,450
What kind of whiskey is that?

128
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,650
It's, uh...just says "maccutcheon.

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,350
" all right, then.

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,220
Let's have it.

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,320
No, the bottle, brother.

132
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,550
I mean, if you've come to drink, let's drink.

133
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,380
Hey, let's drink.

134
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,500
- cheers.
- Cheers.

135
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:43,140
she swore like a docker with a crackin' set of knockers

136
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,250
she was only the farmer's daughter yahoo!

137
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,890
- dezzie?
- Cheers.

138
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,570
Hey, are all your songs about drinking

139
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,160
and fighting and girls with one leg?

140
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,090
Well...girls with one leg and a heart of gold.

141
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,840
so, dezzie...

142
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,800
let me ask you something.

143
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,740
Anything, pal.

144
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,460
How'd you know claire was drowning?

145
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,340
well, I could hear her calling for help.

146
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,360
Uh, no, you didn'T.

147
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,880
You were, like, a mile away.

148
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,720
well, I suppose I...I've got good hearing.

149
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,690
You, uh, hear the lightning as well?

150
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,950
Excuse me?

151
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,810
The lightning.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,830
Just by chance, you pitched your little rod outside claire's tent,

153
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,840
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

154
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,770
thanks for the drink, pal.

155
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,880
Hey, I don't know what you're doing.

156
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,350
You'd best tell us.Oy!

157
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,260
You thinkbecause you turned some key, that makes you a hero?

158
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,030
You're no hero, brother.

159
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,660
I don't know how you're doingwhat it is you're doing,

160
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,650
but I know a coward when I see one.

161
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,700
Yeah--

162
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,350
you don't want to knowwhat happened to me when I turned that key!

163
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,830
- You don't want to know-
-dude!

164
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,820
- Get off!
- You don't want to know!

165
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,530
Wait!Desmond!

166
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,600
I'll see youin another life, brother.

167
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,080
I love you, penny.

168
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, my god...

169
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,800
Des, are you all right?

170
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,230
Stay there.Hang on.

171
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,050
I'm just getting ice.

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,840
Oh, god.

173
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,900
Are you all right?

174
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,740
Sweetie, you okay?

175
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,750
What's happening?

176
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,380
Well, what's happeningis the result of combining ladders,

177
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,490
paintingthe ceiling and alcohol.

178
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,030
Are you okay?Are you nauseous?

179
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,480
- This is my flat.
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,380
Although if you want meto feel at home here,

181
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,790
you might startcalling it our flat.

182
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,280
How many fingers, des?

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
Luv, look at me.

184
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,680
What's wrong?

185
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,000
Absolutely nothing.

186
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,040
Here.Let me.

187
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,670
- Thanks.
- Hang on.

188
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,390
You've got painton your neck.

189
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,110
Have I?

190
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,130
How's that concussion?

191
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,570
Well, my severe head injuryis a small price to

192
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,490
pay for the pleasure of having...

193
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,370
you move into my humble...

194
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,100
is "rat trap" accurate?

195
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,420
Voil.

196
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,150
You know don't really nea job from my father, des.

197
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,200
It's not about the job.

198
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,310
I want him to respect me.

199
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,430
Then respect you he shall.

200
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,890
But if for some reasonhe's too daft to see how brilliantyou are,

201
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,960
it's notthe end of the world.

202
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
What did you say?

203
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,330
here you go, luv.

204
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,800
You all right?

205
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,900
Yeah.Yeah, I'm fine.

206
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,820
Just, uh...just had a bit of a déj vu,that's all.

207
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,550
Uh, good afternoon.

208
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,730
I'm hereto see mr.Widmore.

209
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,190
And you are?

210
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,870
Hume...uh, mr.Desmond hume.

211
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,970
hello, luv.

212
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,750
Got a parcel here for 815.

213
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,620
Excuse me.

214
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,410
What did you say?

215
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,370
I said, "delivery for 815.

216
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,950
Mr.Hume.Mr.Widmoreis ready for you.

217
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,260
Thank you.

218
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,760
Penny didn't tell meyou were an actor, desmond.

219
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,980
Uh, no.It's actually set design for the royalshakespeare company.

220
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,750
Impressive.

221
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,050
You didn't graduatefrom university.

222
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,440
No, sir.

223
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,600
I had to look after my threebrothers after my father--

224
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,550
any military experience?

225
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,610
No, sir.

226
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,250
She's beautiful...

227
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,020
your boat.

228
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,610
My foundation is sponsoringa solo race around the world.

229
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,590
Something wrong?

230
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,870
No.No, sir.

231
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,310
Well, desmond,I'm going to see to it

232
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,660
that you have a position inour administrative department.

233
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,100
Not the most glamorous duty,but...it's a start.

234
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,310
I'll speakto human resources

235
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,870
uh, with alldue respect, sir...

236
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,890
I haven't come here to interview fora position in your company.

237
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,610
You haven't?

238
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,160
No, sir.

239
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,840
I came here to ask for yourdaughter's hand in marriage.

240
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,730
We've been togethertwo years now, and...

241
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,780
pen's moving in...

242
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,230
and...I love her.

243
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,530
Your permissionwould mean everything to me.

244
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,630
I'm impressed, hume.

245
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,930
Very noble gesture.

246
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,980
You know anythingabout whiskey?

247
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,990
Uh, no,I'm afraid not, sir.

248
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,280
This is a 60-year maccutcheon, named afteranderson maccutcheon,

249
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,780
esteemed admiralfrom the royal navy.

250
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,550
He retiredwith more medals an any manbefore or since,

251
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,660
moved to the highlandsto see out his remaining years.

252
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,580
Admiral maccutcheonwas a great man, hume.

253
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,780
This washis crowning achievement.

254
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:38,380
This swallow is worth more than you could makein a month.

255
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,550
And to share it with youwould be a waste

256
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,730
and a disgrace to the great man who made it, because you,

257
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,130
hume, will never be a great man.

258
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,170
Mr.Widmore...I know I'm not--

259
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,850
what you're not is worthyof drinking my whiskey.

260
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,200
How could you ever beworthy of my daughter?

261
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,850
Thank you very much.A fiver!

262
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,290
Thank you very much.

263
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,540
- I know you.
- That's fine.See you later.

264
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,470
- How do I know you?
- Thank you.

265
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,200
You can leaveyour number if you want.

266
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,840
How do I know you?

267
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,820
- I don'T...uh...
- where do I know you from?

268
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,400
Look, I don't know, but I'll remember if I could get some help.

269
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,230
hey, can I get some help?

270
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,910
You're charlie.

271
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,110
Yeah, name's on the sign.

272
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,870
System failure.

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
No...

274
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,770
thanks a lot.

275
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,160
The--the--it was in the hatch.

276
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,640
I remember seeing you.

277
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,870
There was A...there was a computer.

278
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,450
There was a--there was a button.We...

279
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,700
we were on an island.

280
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,090
We are on an island, mate.This is england.

281
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,830
No, it was real, man I remember!

282
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,920
Hey, all right.

283
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,910
Let's just-- this is whywe don't do drugs.

284
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,130
No, this--I remember this.

285
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,140
This all happened before.

286
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,490
To-today...this happened today.This...

287
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,360
this--I rememberthat he said I wasn't worthy,

288
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,000
and then I--and then I came downand I-I-I took off my tie,

289
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,200
and--and then--I lost my tie,and penny said, "where was it?

290
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,820
" And then--and thenit started to rain,

291
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,960
****Bit neat.

292
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,340
The wild card, partridge,is unpredictability.

293
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,080
Run the same test ten times,you'll get ten different outcomes.

294
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,370
That's what makes life so wonderfully--

295
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,900
donovan!Case in point.

296
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,200
Who could have knownthat a drenched scotsman would appearin this rotunda?

297
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,630
You've looked better, des.Not much, but--

298
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,450
I need to ask you something.

299
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,620
By all means, do.

300
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,010
What do you knowabout time travel?

301
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,450
Are you bloody insane?

302
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,200
Just tell meif it's possible.

303
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,430
Which part?

304
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,150
The islandfull of mysterious hatches,

305
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,640
or the computer which keepsthe world from ending?

306
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,030
No.

307
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,870
Forget you'remy best mate, all right?

308
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,420
As a physicist, is it possiblethat I've somehow managed to

309
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,720
go back in time and am now living my lifeover again?

310
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,920
it's not funny, donovan.

311
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,260
Penny's father berates youfor t being a great man,

312
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,040
and voil,you've dreamed a future where you push a buttonto save the world.

313
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,430
These things are notin my head, brother.

314
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,400
I remember things.

315
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,650
All right, then.

316
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,850
What happens next?

317
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,870
It doesn't work like that.

318
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,890
I don't remember everything,just...

319
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,330
just bits and pieces.

320
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,770
How wonderfully convenient.

321
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,570
I remember this.

322
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,900
I know this song.

323
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,010
The jukebox...

324
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,930
des, you're worrying me now.

325
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,370
I remember this night.

326
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,670
graybridge comes backfrom two goals down in

327
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,750
the final two minutesto win this game.

328
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,470
It's a bloody miracle!

329
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,440
And right after they win, jimmy lennon's gonna comethrough

330
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,450
that door and hit the bartender rightin the head with a cricket bat,

331
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,200
'cause he owes him money.

332
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:43,990
- Seriously, des-
- watch, please.

333
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,000
Just watch.

334
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,110
He'llscore the first goal right now.

335
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,650
oh!Brilliant save by...

336
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,090
no, no, they--they came back.

337
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,030
They--they won.

338
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,570
Jimmy lennon, cricket bat.

339
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,450
there's no such thingas time travel, des.

340
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,990
And from what I understand, true love can bejust as unlikely.

341
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,680
So if you love penny, stop messing aboutand marry her.

342
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,740
You smell like the pub.

343
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,840
That's becauseI was at the pub.

344
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,430
You didn't get the job.

345
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,150
No.

346
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,590
What did my father say?

347
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,250
Your father...was lovely.

348
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,750
we just both agreedthat I wasn'T...exactly qualified.

349
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,030
I say we celebrate.

350
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,310
I say we celebrate that fate has spared youa miserable existence

351
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,710
under the employof widmore industries.

352
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,190
Let me take you outtomorrow.

353
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,450
Let's go for lobsterson the pier, my treat.

354
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,780
I don't think my failureto impress your father is any occasionto celebrate.

355
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,050
Well, the occasion isI love you.

356
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,380
Why?

357
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,200
Why do you love me?

358
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,880
'Cause you're a good man.

359
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,850
In my experience,they're pretty hard to come by.

360
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,550
Hey.Des?

361
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,610
Where are you?

362
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,790
I'm right here.

363
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,030
Never done this before,have you?

364
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,940
Is it that obvious?

365
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,650
I can always tellthe first-timers.

366
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,670
Now then, may I askyour price range?

367
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,530
I'm not a man of means.

368
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
I hope to, you know,one day...

369
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,630
I have just the thing.

370
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,770
This won't blind any queens,to be sure, but still,

371
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,870
it hasthe sparkle of life.

372
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,500
I'll take it.

373
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,750
I'M...sorry?

374
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,750
It's perfect.I'll take it.

375
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,570
No, you won'T.

376
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,930
Give me the ring.Give it here.

377
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,900
I don't understand.

378
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,610
This is wrong.

379
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,620
You don't buy the ring.

380
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,390
You--you have second thoughts.

381
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,170
You walk right out that door.

382
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,670
So come on.Let's have it.

383
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,080
I don't knowwhat you're on about.

384
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,840
You don't buy the ring,desmond.

385
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,290
How do you know my name?

386
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,110
Well, I know your nameas well as I know that you don't ask pennyto marry you.

387
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,980
In fact,you break her heart.

388
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,420
Well, breaking her heart,of course,

389
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,480
is what drives youin a few short years from now

390
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,590
to enter that sailing raceto prove her father wrong,

391
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,790
which brings youto the island where you spend the nextthree years

392
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,120
of your life entering numbersinto the computer,

393
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,090
until you are forcedto turn that fail-safe key.

394
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,350
And if you don't dothose things, desmond david hume,

395
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,420
every single one of usis dead.

396
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,630
So give methat sodding ring.

397
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,050
ah, you're going to be difficultabout this, I can see.

398
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,680
Wh..who are you?

399
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,640
Do you like chestnuts?

400
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,440
What?

401
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,980
Thank you.

402
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,330
That man over thereis wearing red shoes.

403
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,640
So?What, then?

404
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,810
Just thought it was a boldfashion choice worth noting.

405
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,850
This isn't really happening,is it?

406
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,620
Sorry?

407
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,980
I've had a concussion.

408
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,210
You're my subconscious.

409
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,650
Am I?

410
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,770
You're here to...

411
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,410
to talk me outof marrying penny.

412
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,230
Well, it won't bloody work.

413
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,960
Oh, yes, it will.

414
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,350
No.

415
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,120
There is no island.

416
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,180
There is no button.

417
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,420
It's madness.

418
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,430
I love her.She loves me.

419
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,920
I'm gonna spend the restof my life with her.

420
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,830
No, desmond...

421
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,370
you're not.

422
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,870
oh, my god.

423
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,370
You knew that was gonna happen,didn't you?

424
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,830
Then why didn't youstop it?

425
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,580
Why didn't you do anything?

426
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,730
Because it wouldn't matter.

427
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:44,090
Had I warned himabout the scaffolding, tomorrow he'd be hitby a taxi.

428
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,400
If I warned himabout the taxi, he'd fall in the showerand break his neck.

429
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,170
The universe, unfortunately,has a y of...

430
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,570
course-correcting.

431
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,110
That man was supposed to die.

432
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,350
That was his path.

433
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,240
just as it's your path to go to the island.

434
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,030
You don't do itbecause you choose to, desmond,

435
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,230
you do itbecause you're supposed to.

436
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,630
I'm gonna meetennyin an hour.

437
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,610
I've got the ring.

438
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,810
She'll say yes.

439
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,490
I can choosewhatever I want.

440
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,850
You may not like your path,desmond,

441
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:46,030
but pushing that button is the only truly great thingthat you will ever do.

442
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,910
how much for the ring?

443
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,170
- hi.
- Hey.

444
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,690
- Am I late?
- Right on time.

445
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,470
Oy.
Take your photo,lovebirds?

446
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,640
No,thanks,mate.

447
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,870
Come on,somethingto show the grandkids.

448
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh,come on,des,let's do
itfor all those grandkids.

449
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,260
Yeah?
You'll do it?

450
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,740
All righty.

451
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,410
Let's see whatwe got for you here,eh?

452
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:06,520
- Ah,a beautiful desert scene.
- Nah.

453
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,360
No,not the desert?
All right.

454
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,000
Ah,I know.
The alps.

455
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,510
Ah,I love the alps.

456
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,570
Oh,I hate the alps.

457
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,560
Yeah,not the alps.

458
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,750
Ah,here we go.
Beautiful marina scene.

459
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,810
- Yeah,let's do that.
- It's the one,isn't it?

460
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,330
all right.

461
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,430
- Take your coat off.
- You guys get in position.

462
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,230
It's boiling.
There's palm trees.

463
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,070
all right.
Here we go.

464
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,600
One,two...

465
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,700
oh,an instant classic.

466
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,910
- Only 5 quid.
- Here we go,luv.

467
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,200
Here you go,mate.

468
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,030
Out of 20.

469
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:47,850
small price to payfor the memories,right?

470
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,220
I couldn'tgo through with it.

471
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,330
What was that?

472
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,600
I can't do this.

473
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,090
You can't do what?

474
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,290
Us.

475
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,520
This...

476
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,460
this relationship.

477
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,550
What are you talking about?

478
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,580
How can I?
I...

479
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,080
I can't look after you.
I haven't got a job.

480
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,370
I don't have any...

481
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,830
I can't even afford 5
quidfor a bloody photograph.

482
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,270
You deserve someone better.

483
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,140
I know what I deserve. I
choseto be with you. I love you.

484
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,630
Love's not enough.
Being a good man is not enough.

485
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,850
What's this about,des?
Where's this coming from?

486
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,430
It's all happening too
soon--you moving in,

487
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,210
you--you're painting
rooms,you're changing things.

488
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,300
I don't even like red.

489
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,650
And why would you leave your
flat--your expensive flat--

490
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,620
don't do that.

491
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:05,580
Don't you pretendyou don't care,and
don't you darerewrite history.

492
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:09,920
I left my expensive flat 'cause you
were too proudto live there,remember?

493
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,400
If you want me to go,if
you want me to leave,

494
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,230
then don't make this about
what I door don't deserve...

495
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,690
and have the decency to admitthat you're
doing this because you're a coward.

496
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,530
I'm sorry,pen,but this...

497
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,130
we're notsupposed to be together.

498
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,020
what'll it be?

499
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,960
Uh...

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520

pint of your cheapest.

501
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,600

502
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,060
Oh? What's the occasion?

503
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:43,330
I think I've madethe biggest mistake
of my life,and the worst part is...

504
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,890
I'm pretty sureI've made it before.

505
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,400
That's whatthey call déj vu,mate.

506
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,570
Do they now?

507
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,210
I had the wrong night.

508
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,090
I was right.

509
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,800
I was off by a night.
I heard the song,and then...

510
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,150
I remember this.

511
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:24,200
I'm not crazy!

512
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,150
I can still change things.

513
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,120
I can still change it.

514
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,340
jimmy lennon.

515
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,300
Where the hell's my money?

516
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,570
Hey,duck,brother!

517
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,010
No.

518
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,660
Oh,no.

519
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,990
No.

520
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,590
Please...

521
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,000
let me go back.

522
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,270
Let me go backone more time.

523
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,640
I'll do it right.
I'll do it right this time.

524
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm sorry,penny.

525
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,140
I'll change it.

526
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,610
I'll change it.

527
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
how'd you knowclaire was drowning?

528
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,830
Well,I could hear hercalling for help.

529
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:42,440
You,uh,hear the lightning as well?

530
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,300
Just by chance,you pitched your
little rod outside claire's tent,

531
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,390
and two hours later,lightning strikes.

532
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,490
I don't know how you're doingwhat it is
you're doing,but I know a cowardwhen I see one.

533
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,380
Yeah,a coward-- aah!

534
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,760
You don't want to knowwhat happened
to me when I turned that key!

535
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,500
Get off!

536
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,950
- You don't want to know!
- Dude!

537
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,370
You don't want to knowwhat happened to me.

538
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,410
You don't want to know!

539
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,250
you don't want to know!

540
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,590
It doesn't matter what you do.

541
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,150
What the hell are you doing?

542
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,030
You can't change it.

543
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,680
you can't change it.

544
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,180
No matter what you try to
do,you just can't change it.

545
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,750
He's wankered.
Let's get him to his tent.

546
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,070
All right,des,come on.
Give me your arm.

547
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,020
Come on. Stand up. Stand up!

548
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,490
Okay.
Okay.

549
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,980
You're a good man,charlie.

550
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,970
Listen,I'm sorry I triedto
strangle you,all rig?

551
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,370
Oh,fair play,mate.
Here we go.

552
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,400
sorry I called you a coward.

553
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,990
Ah,you're all right,pal.

554
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,450
Desmond...

555
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,900
you are gonna tell mewhat happened to you.

556
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,540
When I turned that key...

557
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,030
my life...

558
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,750
flashed before my eyes,

559
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,790
and then I was backin the jungle

560
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,810
,still onthis bloody island.

561
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,720
But those flashes,charlie...

562
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,380
those flashes--they
didn't stop.

563
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,900
So...

564
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,660
you're telling me you saw a flash
of clairedrowning this morning?

565
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,520
That's how you knewhow to save her?

566
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,090
I wasn't saving claire,charlie.

567
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,050
I was saving you.

568
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:11,210
This morning,you dove in after claire.

569
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,360
You tried to save her,but...

570
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,020
you--you drowned.

571
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,360
What are you talking about?

572
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,090
I didn't drown.

573
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:32,750
When I saw the lightninghit
the roof,you were electrocuted.

574
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,830
And when you heardclaire
was in the water,you...

575
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,450
you drownedtrying to save her.

576
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,440
I dove in myself,so you never went in.

577
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,570
I've tried,brother.
I've tried twice to save you,but...

578
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,480
the universe hasa way of course-correcting,

579
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,030
and...and I can'tstop it forever.

580
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,200
I'm sorry.I'm sorry because...

581
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,000
no matter what I try to do...

582
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,120
you're gonna die,charlie.
