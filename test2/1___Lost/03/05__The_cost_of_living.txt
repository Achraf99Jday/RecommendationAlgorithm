1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:02,177
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,604
Stop! Or I'll shoot!

3
00:00:04,681 --> 00:00:06,183
No, you won't Sun.

4
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:10,478
Jack, I need your help.

5
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:13,428
They're not hers.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,090
She's gone.

7
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:22,676
The plane was loaded with heroin.

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:27,530
Where did you find this?

9
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,353
In the jungle.
I found it in the jungle.

10
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,432
Take me there.

11
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,584
Eko? Who's that?

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,297
He's my brother.

13
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,440
Forgive me. Forgive me.

14
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:09,998
Here, eat.

15
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,004
It's okay, Yemi.

16
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,761
Eko.

17
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:32,579
All right, Eko. Go.

18
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,186
Did you hear me? Go.

19
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,117
Confess that
you have stolen.

20
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:43,448
Yemi was hungry.

21
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,740
That is not an excuse.

22
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,435
You have sinned, Eko.

23
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:50,055
Hunger does not matter.

24
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:57,077
Now go.

25
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,907
Ask God for forgiveness.

26
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,054
Confess!

27
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:37,880
How long
has he been like this?

28
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:39,524
Couple days, now.

29
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:45,697
Eko, can you hear me?

30
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,292
What happened to him?

31
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,802
Before or after we saved him
from the polar bear cave?

32
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:59,064
Come on. Locke will want
to know you guys are back.

33
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:06,855
Stay alive, dude.

34
00:03:07,664 --> 00:03:08,666
Okay?

35
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:20,633
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,704
I have come
to give my confession.

37
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:26,767
Hello, Eko.

38
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,666
Hello, brother.

39
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:32,059
I have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

40
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,196
You mean drugs.

41
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,547
You make us priests and we will
fly the drugs out ourselves.

44
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:46,196
No more! Stop now!

45
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:02,649
Father.

46
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:05,712
Are you okay, father?

47
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,978
Eko. Eko, wake up.

48
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:27,633
It is time to confess...

49
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,622
to be judged, brother.

50
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,302
I will be waiting.

51
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:41,586
You know
where to find me.

52
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:47,321
You guys smell smoke?

53
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:51,234
Get him clear!

54
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,330
Help me!

55
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,336
Bring him out.

56
00:04:58,184 --> 00:04:59,205
Bring him out.

57
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,349
- We gotta get outta here.
- Cover him with this.

58
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:02,564
Be careful!
Be careful!

59
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,840
Lay him down.

60
00:05:11,517 --> 00:05:12,538
You're okay.

61
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,770
You're all right.

62
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,217
My brother...

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,703
My... brother.

64
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,021
You're all right.

65
00:05:22,252 --> 00:05:23,639
It's okay. Okay.

66
00:05:24,274 --> 00:05:25,392
You're all right.

67
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:26,721
I'll be back.

68
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,835
Brother... Yemi...

69
00:05:30,278 --> 00:05:31,283
Charlie!

70
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:34,282
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah. We're good.

71
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,418
Where's Eko?

72
00:05:35,637 --> 00:05:37,678
Hurley and I
pulled him out over...

73
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:42,430
he was right there.

74
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,066
Good evening, Jack.

75
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:29,530
Good evening, Ben.

76
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,973
I was hoping you might
join me for a walk.

77
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,935
What?

78
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,505
Well, you say that like...

79
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,199
you're not gonna
just throw a bag over my head

80
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:41,108
and drag me outta here if I say no.

81
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,593
Then don't say no.

82
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,440
Why don't you put this on?

83
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:55,208
I'll wait outside.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,041
Does it hurt?

85
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,650
Sorry?

86
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,710
Your neck, does it hurt?

87
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,440
Any numbness
in your fingers and toes,

88
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:13,962
like pins and needles

89
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,368
when your foot falls asleep,

90
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:16,713
but permanent?

91
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,408
Why are you asking me
these questions, Jack?

92
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,389
Because, Ben,

93
00:07:25,198 --> 00:07:26,874
you have a tumor on your spine--

94
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:28,224
an aggressive tumor...

95
00:07:29,052 --> 00:07:31,005
that is going to kill you.

96
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:36,957
I don't know when those
X-rays were taken that I saw,

97
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:39,094
but unless
they were very recent...

98
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,774
you're not gonna be
taking walks much longer.

99
00:07:46,406 --> 00:07:48,439
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

100
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,914
Okay. My mistake, then.

101
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,476
I'm ready
whenever you are.

102
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,325
Stay here.

103
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,845
As we prepare to send
Colleen on her way,

104
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:38,767
I'd like to take a moment...

105
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:39,999
I hate funerals.

106
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:43,043
He let you out?

107
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:47,251
Gave me a new shirt, too.

108
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:54,158
Bye, Jack.

109
00:09:27,852 --> 00:09:29,990
Why did you show him my X-rays?

110
00:09:31,061 --> 00:09:32,737
I didn't tell him
they were yours...

111
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:35,868
But I guess you did.

112
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,296
I think I know how
to find Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

113
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,822
Can I ask why he's being
included in the conversation?

114
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,364
Is that supposed
to hurt my feelings?

115
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,335
Tell him
what you told me.

116
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,107
The computer in the hatch

117
00:10:01,242 --> 00:10:03,174
wasn't only
for pushing the button.

118
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,781
I'm pretty sure

119
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:09,323
that it can be used
to communicate with other stations.

120
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:11,341
This is fascinating,

121
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,445
but you just told me the hatch exploded.

122
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:15,084
One of them did.

123
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:19,562
You want to try
and communicate with the others.

124
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:20,910
Yep.

125
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,182
No luck, dudes.

126
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,800
We looked everywhere.

127
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:26,360
Eko's gone.

128
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:27,940
There was no trail.

129
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,282
Not that we, like, know
what a trail looks like.

130
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:32,890
When you pulled him out of
the tent, did he say anything?

131
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:34,219
Nothing coherent.

132
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:35,414
He was just mumbling

133
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,142
"my brother, my brother."

134
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,245
Sayid, pack your gear.

135
00:10:41,264 --> 00:10:42,698
We're going to that computer.

136
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:44,123
Wait. What about Eko?

137
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,356
We'll catch up to him.

138
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:47,776
We're all going
to the same place.

139
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,602
You're home, father.

140
00:12:28,777 --> 00:12:29,759
Father?

141
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,779
I was looking
for father Yemi.

142
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:43,361
Father Yemi is... Is gone.

143
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,133
He was called away
quite suddenly...

144
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,149
an emergency
at the refugee camp down south.

145
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,018
I am Amina.

146
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:54,847
I work at the clinic.

147
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,529
This is my son Daniel.
He's the altar boy here.

148
00:13:01,945 --> 00:13:03,429
Are you taking his place?

149
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:05,432
Yes.

150
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,780
Will father Yemi
still go to London?

151
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,271
- London?
- He was leaving at the end of the week.

152
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,264
He was going
to continue his studies.

153
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,780
I will
take his place there, too.

154
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:09,380
Don't! No!
Please!

155
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:18,636
Confess.

156
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,362
We're headed now to the Pearl station.

157
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,827
There's a computer there that
might help us find our people.

158
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:37,251
Anybody want to come along?

159
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,098
What do you mean:
"Anybody wanna come along"?

160
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:43,278
I mean, if you'd like to join us,
it's a free island.

161
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:47,632
Yeah, see, Jack would go
and do stuff alone

162
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,013
or he'd take Sayid or Kate.

163
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:54,752
Yeah, well, I'm not Jack.

164
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,377
The more the merrier.

165
00:14:58,474 --> 00:14:59,495
I'll go.

166
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,064
- Great.
- What?

167
00:15:01,507 --> 00:15:04,210
Anybody else wanna come, meet us
at the tree line in ten minutes.

168
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,308
Bring water.

169
00:15:06,252 --> 00:15:07,408
You're not serious.

170
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:11,288
What? You always whine
about not being included.

171
00:15:11,627 --> 00:15:12,802
Now's our chance.

172
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,373
Do you mind if I ask you
a question, brother?

173
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:22,625
Shoot.

174
00:15:22,644 --> 00:15:24,791
Are we going off
to poke at a computer,

175
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,300
or are we going
after your man Eko?

176
00:15:28,732 --> 00:15:30,355
Two birds, one stone.

177
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,387
Eko's heading for the plane
that crashed

178
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:36,441
on top of the entrance
to the Pearl station.

179
00:15:37,866 --> 00:15:39,587
Well, that's quite
a coincidence.

180
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:43,589
Don't mistake coincidence
for fate.

181
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,059
You're not supposed
to do that.

182
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:29,815
That's holy water.

183
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,247
I'm washing away my sins.

184
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,592
- Father Yemi would never...
- I'm not father Yemi.

185
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:41,572
Wait there!

186
00:16:56,177 --> 00:16:57,945
Where...
Where is father Yemi?

187
00:16:58,882 --> 00:17:00,018
Who wants to know?

188
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,040
Perhaps you did not
hear me.

189
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:12,410
I said,
where is father Yemi?

190
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,711
The shipment is late.

191
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:15,604
I just got off the telephone.

192
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:17,626
They assure me
it will arrive on Friday.

193
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,757
What shipment?

194
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:21,557
You should explain our
arrangement to your new priest.

195
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,890
We receive shipments of vaccines
from the Red Cross.

196
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,559
We are allowed to keep 20%.

197
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,619
The rest, we give
to Emeka and his men.

198
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:31,640
In exchange for protection.

199
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,042
So you see, father...

200
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:39,049
everybody is happy, huh?

201
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:42,170
Everybody's happy.

202
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,414
Everybody benefits.

203
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:48,779
So I hope you will continue
to honor our arrangement.

204
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:52,988
I am not afraid of you.

205
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,909
I'll be back for the vaccine
on Friday, father.

206
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,604
You don't want more lives
on your conscience.

207
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,515
Hello, Eko!

208
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:37,747
You wanna guess
what's for lunch?

209
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,268
I'm not...
I'm not big on mysteries.

210
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,809
Of course you're not.

211
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:51,583
You people have cheeseburgers?

212
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:54,259
You have no idea

213
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:56,513
what I went through
to make this for you.

214
00:19:57,206 --> 00:19:58,467
I killed the cow,

215
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,451
processed the meat, baked the bun.

216
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,763
And the fries...

217
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:05,724
try rendering animal fat.

218
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,748
No ketchup?

219
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:18,995
I'd like to talk to him.

220
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,938
Okay, so talk to him.

221
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:23,806
Alone, please.

222
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:25,273
I'm fine with her
being here.

223
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:27,841
And I'm thrilled that you're fine, Jack,
but it's private.

224
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,615
Doctor-patient confidentiality?

225
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,319
Sure.

226
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:38,707
Sure. Of course.

227
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,275
Mind if I eat?

228
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,506
We had such a wonderful plan
to break you, Jack.

229
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,962
Break me?

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,370
Wear you down until you were convinced
we weren't your enemies.

231
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,316
Get you to trust us.

232
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,691
And then, of course,
we'd lead you to believe

233
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,290
that you were choosing to do

234
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,409
whatever we asked you to do.

235
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:18,644
All of this assumed, of course,
that you would get invested.

236
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,869
Invested in what?

237
00:21:21,998 --> 00:21:23,192
Has it not occurred to you

238
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,300
that Juliet bears a striking
resemblance to your ex-wife?

239
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,412
Why are you
telling me this?

240
00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:36,771
I'm telling you this, Jack,

241
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:38,559
because my wonderful plan

242
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,742
got shot to sunshine

243
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:44,869
when you saw my damned X-rays
and figured out I was dying.

244
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,316
All of this...

245
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,908
you brought me here
to operate on you.

246
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:54,135
You...

247
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:57,243
you want me
to save your life.

248
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:00,277
No, I want you
to want to save my life.

249
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,224
But we're
beyond that now, so...

250
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,095
all I can ask
is that you think about it.

251
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,432
Do you believe in God, Jack?

252
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,225
Do you?

253
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:33,868
Two days after I found out
I had a fatal tumor on my spine,

254
00:22:33,925 --> 00:22:36,231
a spinal surgeon
fell out of the sky.

255
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:41,564
And if that's
not proof of God,

256
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,508
I don't know what is.

257
00:23:05,054 --> 00:23:06,200
You sure
you're all right?

258
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,150
We can stop for a bit
and catch our breaths.

259
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,297
I'm fine.

260
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:17,518
You're heading for
the plane wreckage, aren't you?

261
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:21,130
Charlie heard you call out for your
brother before you left the camp.

262
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,738
Is that
what you're doing out here,

263
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:26,182
looking for Yemi?

264
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:31,314
Do not speak
my brother's name again.

265
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,539
What are you
so afraid of, Eko?

266
00:23:42,165 --> 00:23:43,854
You need to come back
in two days.

267
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,241
Father.

268
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:47,167
What can I do for you?

269
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,984
It's that the vaccines
that you spoke of...

270
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,771
how often
do the shipments come?

271
00:23:52,002 --> 00:23:53,959
Every six months,
if we are lucky.

272
00:23:57,242 --> 00:24:00,459
What makes you so interested
in our shipments of vaccine, father?

273
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,752
You agreed to give
most of it to the militia?

274
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,132
The vaccines fetch a high price
on the black market.

275
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:15,000
Whatever you are thinking,
do not cross these men.

276
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,548
Before father Yemi,
we got nothing.

277
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,754
We owe whatever vaccines
we have to his work.

278
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,926
You remind me of him,
you know.

279
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:27,873
You are a good man, too.

280
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,754
I hear you have
some vaccine to sell.

281
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:54,210
I do, but it has to be done by Sunday.

282
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:55,539
I'm leaving the country.

283
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,214
No problem.

284
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,838
The hatch
is over here by the plane.

285
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:12,389
Why don't you
take everybody down?

286
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:13,968
And you?

287
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:16,048
I'll be there in a minute.

288
00:25:19,824 --> 00:25:21,365
What's Eko looking for?

289
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:23,327
His brother's body's
in that plane.

290
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,611
So...

291
00:25:49,746 --> 00:25:52,000
what exactly
did you see back there?

292
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:55,621
I saw it once, you know.

293
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,308
What did you see?

294
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:00,043
I saw a very bright light.

295
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:03,741
It was beautiful.

296
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,961
That is not what I saw.

297
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:54,729
My brother's gone.

298
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,245
You set the plane on fire.

299
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:01,239
Yemi's body could have burned.

300
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:03,175
Not to mention animals or...

301
00:27:15,388 --> 00:27:17,719
so... you don't wanna
come down there with us?

302
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:26,204
No, I will wait here.

303
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,479
Well...

304
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:32,058
Oh, I forgot.

305
00:27:33,233 --> 00:27:35,423
I found this
when I was looking for you.

306
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,323
Hello, father.

307
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,372
I hear you have a shipment
of vaccine for sale.

308
00:28:31,202 --> 00:28:33,656
If you thought you could do this
without me knowing,

309
00:28:34,696 --> 00:28:35,871
you don't know who I am.

310
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:41,390
You know...

311
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,586
you're lucky, father.

312
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,431
I'm a superstitious man.

313
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:48,999
I don't relish taking
the life of a holy man.

314
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,387
That is why, today,

315
00:28:53,737 --> 00:28:55,707
I'm only going to cut off
your hands.

316
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,375
Please! No!

317
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:18,367
You do not know
who I am.

318
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:57,785
<i>I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,</i>

319
00:29:57,891 --> 00:29:59,547
<i>and this is the orientation film</i>

320
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:01,030
<i>for station five</i>

321
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:02,513
<i>of Dharma Initiative.</i>

322
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:04,747
<i>Station five, or the Pearl,</i>

323
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,661
<i>is a monitoring station</i>

324
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:10,662
<i>where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

325
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:12,713
<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

326
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,542
Well?

327
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,245
The wiring
is only one way.

328
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:18,172
It's a closed system,

329
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:19,346
a dead end.

330
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,610
Hey, guys?

331
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:23,209
What are
these other TVs for?

332
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:25,174
Sorry?

333
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:27,331
All these TVs.

334
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,273
This guy says
that there's six stations.

335
00:30:31,101 --> 00:30:32,549
All right, here.
Check it out.

336
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:38,982
<i>...is a monitoring station</i>

337
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,948
<i>where the activities of the participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

338
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:45,183
<i>can be observed and recorded...</i>

339
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,501
Projects. More than one.

340
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:50,890
So maybe some of these TVs are
connected to the other hatches.

341
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:53,361
Well, I'm suddenly
feeling very stupid.

342
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,093
Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

343
00:30:56,267 --> 00:30:58,004
see if we can get
another picture.

344
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:01,112
<i>Your tour of duty in the Pearl
will last three weeks...</i>

345
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,371
The toilet still works.

346
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,821
Anything yet?

347
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:20,016
Nothing.

348
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:22,631
What about now?

349
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:29,945
Yeah, we got something.

350
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:35,168
What is it?

351
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:37,133
That's a good question.

352
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:39,589
Those are computers.

353
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,510
Great. That's what
you're looking for.

354
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:44,763
Now we can
get out of here.

355
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,986
I guess
he'll be expecting us.

356
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,258
You don't
trust me anymore?

357
00:32:18,412 --> 00:32:19,760
I trust you just fine.

358
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:21,513
Just thought I'd put a movie in.

359
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,672
You know what? I'm gonna
pass on the movie.

360
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,362
You'll like this one, Jack.
It's "To kill a mockingbird."

361
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:27,347
It's a classic.

362
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:28,969
I don't wanna
watch a movie right now.

363
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,657
I'll turn
the sound down, then.

364
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,212
I felt like I should apologize,

365
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,386
say I'm sorry.

366
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,412
I'm sorry
for bringing you here

367
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,834
and for everything that's been done
to you and your friends.

368
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,506
But you have to know...

369
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,052
we were desperate.

370
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:54,491
It was all
so we could save his life.

371
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:00,181
Ben...

372
00:33:02,446 --> 00:33:03,795
he's a great man.

373
00:33:06,678 --> 00:33:08,571
I know you find that
hard to believe,

374
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:10,959
but he is.

375
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:17,271
You probably feel like...

376
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:22,295
you don't have a choice,
but you do, Jack.

377
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,653
Free will is all
we've really got, right?

378
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:35,887
Anyway...

379
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:39,084
just wanted
to put in my two cents.

380
00:33:47,332 --> 00:33:49,284
I told you before
you can trust me.

381
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:56,343
I want you to trust me now,

382
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,303
when I tell you
that doing the surgery

383
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,466
is absolutely

384
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:02,606
the right thing
for you to do.

385
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,150
It's the right thing,
because he deserves  to live.

386
00:34:23,722 --> 00:34:25,278
Turn the movie off.

387
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:27,505
Turn it off. Now.

388
00:34:31,897 --> 00:34:33,361
All right. It's off.

389
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,463
Think about what I said...

390
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:50,293
please.

391
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,769
Where are you going?

392
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:03,387
London.

393
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:05,299
Are you a bad man?

394
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,675
My mom says
you are a bad man.

395
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:16,625
Only God knows.

396
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,800
I see
you have your vaccine.

397
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:28,800
Do you expect me
to be grateful?

398
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,200
I know what
you were planning to do.

399
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:32,660
Those men, I helped...

400
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:34,861
Those men will be replaced
by other men.

401
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,192
What are they doing?

402
00:35:41,768 --> 00:35:43,289
What is the meaning of this?

403
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:45,601
They are
boarding up the church.

404
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,760
We can no longer use it.

405
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,263
This is Yemi's church.

406
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:53,363
You have no right to do this.

407
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,788
It is no longer sacred,

408
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:57,573
and one day, you'll be judged
for what you did.

409
00:36:00,482 --> 00:36:01,726
If I were you,

410
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,053
I would start
making my peace now.

411
00:36:04,477 --> 00:36:06,709
I would go to London
and begin to repent,

412
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,315
because you owe God
for every life you've taken.

413
00:36:11,676 --> 00:36:13,516
And you truly believe
this is Yemi's?

414
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:18,215
You owe him one church.

415
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:44,614
Wait.

416
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,867
You say you want
to hear my confession.

417
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,109
Why?
Why now, eh?

418
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:03,947
Show yourself!
Where are you?!

419
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:06,460
Where?!

420
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:27,925
Are you ready, Eko?

421
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,669
Yes.

422
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,672
I am ready, Yemi.

423
00:37:53,543 --> 00:37:55,566
I ask for no forgiveness,
father...

424
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,080
for I have not sinned.

425
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,988
I have only done
what I needed to do to survive.

426
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,440
A small boy once asked me

427
00:38:13,615 --> 00:38:15,137
if I was a bad man.

428
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,813
If I could answer him now,

429
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:21,086
I would tell him

430
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:23,939
that when I was a young boy,

431
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:26,829
I killed a man

432
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:28,871
to save my brother's life.

433
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,964
I am not sorry for this.

434
00:38:37,246 --> 00:38:38,787
I am proud of this.

435
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,561
I did not ask for the life
that I was given,

436
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,893
but it was given
nonetheless.

437
00:38:58,522 --> 00:39:00,160
I did my best.

438
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,088
You speak to me
as if I were your brother.

439
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,022
Who are you?

440
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,309
Who are you?!

441
00:39:28,268 --> 00:39:29,385
Who are you?!

442
00:39:37,004 --> 00:39:38,449
Who are you?

443
00:40:00,169 --> 00:40:01,826
The Lord is my shepherd.

444
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,986
I shall not want...

445
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,624
It's okay. It's okay.

446
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,996
What did he say, John?

447
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,157
He said...

448
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,409
we're next.

449
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,512
