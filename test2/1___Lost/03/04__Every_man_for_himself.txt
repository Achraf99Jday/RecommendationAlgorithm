00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,178
- What do you want from me ?
- Patience, Jack.

3
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:07,483
Patience.

4
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,751
- Danny, wait.
- Hold up.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:12,528
Be careful out there.

6
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:16,304
See these rocks here?
You're gonna chop 'em loose,

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,043
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,537
I am not the enemy.

9
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:26,777
We are not the enemy.

10
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,798
If you shoot me...
that's exactly what we'll become.

11
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,767
You've...

12
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,048
You've got a problem with your roof.

13
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:17,127
What ?

14
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,438
Maybe you should move on the beach,
just for the night.

15
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,176
Then I can fix it and,

16
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:23,550
make some improvments.

17
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,850
That is really nice of you to offer but,

18
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:28,007
Aaron just fell asleep,
so I should probably just...

19
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:29,188
I'll deal with it.

20
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:30,523
I promise.

21
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,080
What are you doing, brother ?

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,085
I was just offering
to fix this roof here.

23
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:38,161
Roof ?

24
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:39,985
Fine.

25
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:41,638
If there a problem, i'll fix it.

26
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm quite handy.

27
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,048
I was building a church before...

28
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,749
Eko explode it.

29
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:50,817
Right,

30
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,396
well...

31
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:55,311
Just trying to help.

32
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:57,775
Thanks.

33
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:01,881
What was all that about ?

34
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:03,823
I don't know.

35
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,092
We gonna have together
another button push.

36
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,889
How are you doing today, Jack ?

37
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,335
Great.

38
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,500
You seem frustrated.

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,674
We going
to keep watching cartoons, or...

40
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,017
are you gonna tell me why I'm here.

41
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:51,878
I hope you like blueberry.

44
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,948
Because I'm sorry
to think that you're just

45
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:00,954
the person who brings me my food.

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,874
You can talk to him all you want,

47
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:06,150
but he won't tell you anything.

48
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,685
- You work for him.
- No, I don't work for him.

49
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,758
He's in charge.

50
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:11,595
It doesn't work that way over here,
Jack.

51
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:13,178
We make decisions together.

52
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,272
Really?

53
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,298
Because when I was holding
that broken plate at your neck,

54
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:20,688
he seemed happy to just let you die.

55
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,772
I mean, it felt like
he made that decision on his own.

56
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,689
You don't know
what you're talking about.

57
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:31,666
I don't answer to him.

58
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,110
Juliet, I need you.

59
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:36,106
Can it wait?

60
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:40,560
The sub is back. We have a situation,

61
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,709
so come with me now.

62
00:04:06,582 --> 00:04:07,724
Time for work.

63
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,806
Soundin' a little stuffy there,
Chinatown.

64
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:16,152
Need to blow your nose?

65
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,402
- Just give me an excuse.
- Thought I just did.

66
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:20,169
What I gotta do, talk about your mother?

67
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:22,770
<I>Danny, are you there?</I>

68
00:04:23,192 --> 00:04:24,169
Yeah.

69
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:25,915
Hold on.

70
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,750
Okay, go.

71
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,396
What?

72
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,870
- Where are they?
<i>- They're back in the...</i>

73
00:04:40,294 --> 00:04:41,792
This is bad, Juliet.

74
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,154
Keep her steady.

75
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:52,791
She'll be okay?

76
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,099
What happened?

77
00:05:00,084 --> 00:05:01,220
We happened.

78
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:02,824
What?

79
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:05,308
I've been on this rock
long enough to realize

80
00:05:05,374 --> 00:05:07,528
they ain't in the business
of shootin' each other.

81
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,075
We did it.

82
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,463
Our team.

83
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,465
You smiling?

84
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:18,451
Damn right I'm smiling.

85
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,158
'Cause we just got
our ticket outta here.

89
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,639
What are you doin'?

90
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,390
Whenever you're ready to fill me in.

91
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:54,965
Shush up. I'm thinking.

92
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:57,252
<i>Warning.</i>

<i>Reward. Reward.</i>

94
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:15,293
You know that chick
they brought in on a stretcher?

95
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,352
That's broken nose man's girl.

96
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,085
They call him Pickett.

97
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,184
Well,
Pickett is distracted at the moment.

98
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:24,963
So?

99
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,377
Watch and learn, little lady.

100
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:30,880
<i>Warning.</i>

101
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:32,981
<i>Warning.</i>

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,322
There's juice
pumpin' into this box from somewhere.

103
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:39,174
Next time someone comes to pull me out,

104
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,622
I'm gonna wait till they step in
my little swimming hole,

105
00:06:43,623 --> 00:06:44,962
then I grab 'em. Zap.

106
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,929
They fall back from the shock,
I snag the keys.

107
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,241
Bet the bears never thought of that.

108
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,400
You're both gonna get electrocuted.

109
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,847
Yeah, but I felt the jolt.
I can take it.

110
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,711
The other guy,
he ain't gonna be ready for it.

111
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:02,507
What, you think I'm crazy?

112
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,207
No, I'm actually impressed.

113
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:10,884
Well, wipe the stars out of your eyes,
sweetheart, 'cause we're gonna do this.

114
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,591
So what about Jack?

115
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,254
What about him?

116
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,274
We don't even know if he's here.

117
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,617
Hell, we don't even know if he's alive.

118
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:24,706
We gotta take care of us.

119
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:29,191
It's every man for himself, Freckles.

120
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,329
All right, Ford, that's enough.

121
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:46,032
<i>All inmates are required
to report to your cells for mandatory...</i>

122
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:49,384
Problem is, I was following your hands,
not your eyes.

123
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:51,530
Problem is, you old and dumb.

124
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:53,041
Where did you hide it?!

125
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:58,000
Who's the punching bag?

126
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,441
Just got here. Name is Munson.

127
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:05,483
Rumor has it he ripped off
the government for 10 mil,

128
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,433
but they never found the money.

129
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:09,010
I'll be damned.

130
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:12,229
If your buddy the warden
didn't keep breaking up the fights,

131
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:13,883
Munson would be a dead man.

132
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,580
That son of a bitch.

133
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,628
You get little mints
on your pillow at night, too?

134
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:33,940
- Sorry?
- You been here, what, a week,

135
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,660
and you're on tote bag duty?

136
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:39,070
I've been here nine months.
I'm still pushing trash.

137
00:08:39,316 --> 00:08:40,980
Well, what does that mean?

138
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:45,004
You think
the warden's breakin' up those fights

139
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,796
'cause you're cute, Costanza?

140
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,452
He's makin' a play for that 10 mil.

141
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:52,952
First step, butter you up.

142
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:55,086
Give you a plum job.

143
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:57,260
Step two,

144
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,929
the warden will reach out to your wife,

145
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:01,327
use her against you.

146
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,094
Textbook con.

147
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,317
And you're telling me
this out of the kindness...

148
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:10,126
- of your...
- The advice is free, Murgatroyd.

149
00:09:10,532 --> 00:09:14,112
Past nine months, that warden's
made my life a living hell.

150
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,590
He gets that 10 mil you ain't got,

151
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:18,820
I just might have to kill myself.

152
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,640
Well, howdy, warden.

153
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:32,716
He bothering you, Munson?

154
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,279
So what brings you
to the sewing shop, Boss?

155
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:43,957
Don't think
I can't extend your stay, Ford.

156
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,966
All it takes is one call.

157
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:49,779
One call.

158
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:00,327
How about you get that trash?

159
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,267
oh, yeah. It's the big Kahuna.

160
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,167
- Lunch already?
- What do you weigh?

161
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:36,344
- What?
- What do you weigh?

162
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:40,948
180, give or take.

163
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:45,080
How old are you?

164
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:47,970
- 32.
- Don't lie.

165
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:52,346
35.

166
00:10:55,436 --> 00:10:56,489
Good.

167
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,012
Sayonara, sucker.

168
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,752
What did you do?

169
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:15,748
We turned it off.

170
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,823
...two days since the sky turned purple,

171
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,833
we've been blind, our coms are all down
and I can't get 'em back up again,

172
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,083
and in case you forgot,

173
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,781
- Colleen's in critical...
- Juliet's taking care of her.

174
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,430
Where am I?

175
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,117
What the hell are you doin' to me?

176
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,523
Let me out!

177
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,980
Jason.

178
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:09,460
Let me out !

179
00:12:10,115 --> 00:12:11,541
Bite down on this, please.

180
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:12,966
You bite down on it.

181
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:15,798
It's for the pain.

182
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,944
What?!

183
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,218
Wait!

184
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:23,825
Let me out now!

185
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,444
I hate needles.

186
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,919
No! What are you doing?

187
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,874
<i>Hey! What are you doing?!</i>

188
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,768
What the hell are you doing?!

189
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:41,520
No, you have to go through the sternum.
The sternum.

190
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,550
- Like in the movies.
- I know, I know.

191
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:49,573
- One...
- What are you doing?!

192
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:50,925
Two...

193
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,049
Wait!

194
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,534
Don't mind me, brother.

195
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:04,847
I'm just gonna take one of your clubs.

196
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,328
Hurley said it'd be all right.

197
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:09,019
Hurley, huh?

198
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,349
Must mean you're off to save the day.

199
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:13,931
So...

200
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:15,290
I can take one of these?

201
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:16,937
Take the 5-iron.

202
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,639
I never use it.

203
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:21,626
That way, when you die in the jungle
doing whatever you're doing,

204
00:13:21,664 --> 00:13:23,686
I don't have to go looking for it.

205
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,684
Thanks, mate.

206
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:35,914
You know, you might want
to square your shoulders a bit more.

207
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:38,274
- You play golf?
- I'm scottish.

208
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,532
Cheers.

209
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,993
What the hell?

210
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:18,913
Hey, come on.

211
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,025
Hey, move. Let's move.
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

212
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:26,500
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on,

213
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,570
Let's move it, let's move it.

214
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,142
What's your problem?

215
00:14:44,137 --> 00:14:45,913
Did you just kill that bunny?

216
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,930
You know what a pacemaker is?

217
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,981
What?

218
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:58,035
They stick 'em in the tickers
of people who've had bypass work,

219
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,149
whose hearts need just a little jump,
a kick start.

220
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,954
The rabbit had a small pacemaker
set to deliver its kick start,

221
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,683
should it get too excited...

222
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:10,532
or anxious or frightened...

223
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:13,545
or should it try to escape.

224
00:15:19,434 --> 00:15:23,268
Assuming that you were telling the truth
about your age and weight,

225
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:26,977
your resting heart rate
should be about 70 beats per minute.

226
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,521
Your active heart rate, however,

227
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,564
that would be about 140.

228
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,976
Which is the point
at which your pacemaker...

229
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:42,018
will cause your heart to explode.

230
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:51,290
Which is how I know
that you're gonna start behaving now.

231
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,336
The watch monitors your pulse.

232
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,807
If you get within 15 beats
of your danger zone,

233
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,623
it'll start to beep.
If and when it beeps,

234
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:10,759
you're gonna want to relax yourself.

235
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:15,453
Do some deep breathing, some yoga.

236
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:19,973
If you want me dead,

237
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:22,654
why don't you just shoot me
and get it over with?

238
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,301
Because we're not killers, James.

239
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:30,740
Oh, and one other thing.

240
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:34,135
- Kate.
- You touch her, I swear...

241
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,539
You tell her what we did,
what we put in you,

242
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,701
that we're watching you,

243
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,780
you tell her any of these things,

244
00:16:40,016 --> 00:16:42,334
we'll put one in her, too.

245
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,628
Sawyer, are you okay?

246
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:13,442
That's so you can clean yourselves up.

247
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:16,060
And, Kate, if any of that doesn't fit,

248
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,044
you just give me a holler, okay?

249
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:29,491
What happened?

250
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,626
What did they do to you?

251
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:33,875
Nothing.

252
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,010
They just asked me questions.

253
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:40,174
Ain't important.

254
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,092
Talk to me. What happened?

255
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,313
Look, I told you, nothing happened.

256
00:17:45,088 --> 00:17:46,412
So quit asking me.

257
00:18:00,183 --> 00:18:01,347
Turn around.

258
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:38,446
What's that?

259
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,395
Just my watch. It's busted.

260
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,346
- When did you get a watch?
- Look, I don't tell you everything!

261
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,414
Just leave me alone, damn it.

262
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:50,275
Put some clothes on.

263
00:19:22,843 --> 00:19:24,127
Hello, Sawyer.

264
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,152
It's James Ford,

265
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,559
and I know you know that,

266
00:19:32,657 --> 00:19:35,388
'cause you got it right
when you pressed charges.

267
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:36,981
You're mad at me?

268
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,567
Well, look where I am.

269
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:41,600
What did you want me to do?
You conned me.

270
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:42,925
Something you want?

271
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,931
Yeah.

272
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,428
Yeah. There is.

273
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,367
Come on. I got license plates to make.

274
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:11,760
What's this?

275
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,706
This is your daughter.

276
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,287
What do you want?

277
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,103
Well, first I wanted you to know.

278
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,865
Then what? Think I'm gonna take
one look at this picture

279
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,934
and turn into "father knows best"?

280
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:29,459
We're living in this little place
in Albuquerque.

281
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,582
It's near the university.

282
00:20:30,658 --> 00:20:32,807
- Why are you telling me this?
- I just...

283
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,161
thought you could write her a letter.

284
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:36,862
Her name's Clementine.

285
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:39,300
What the hell am I gonna write?
"Dear goo-goo ga-ga"?

286
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,552
She's a baby. She ain't mine.

287
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,060
Sawyer, she...

288
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,437
I ain't got no daughter.

289
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:07,043
I've been checking out my cage,

290
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:08,791
and I think

291
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:12,362
if I climb to the top,
I can squeeze through those bars.

292
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,044
They're spaced farther apart up there.

293
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:16,372
Don't bother.

294
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:21,042
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about being smart.

295
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:24,028
I think we should just
chill out here a while,

296
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,496
get the lay of the land.

297
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,005
<i>...under control. Yeah?
You know what he's doing to Karl?</i>

298
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,705
<i>You know what he's doing?</i>

299
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,758
- What did you do to Sawyer?
- Nothing.

300
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:46,062
I heard him yelling,
you've got blood on your clothes.

301
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:48,418
- What did you do to him?!
- It's not his blood.

302
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:52,733
Then whose blood is it?

303
00:21:53,328 --> 00:21:55,262
It's the bod of a woman who's dying.

304
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,305
I need your help.

305
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,134
it's Jack!

306
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:38,087
Have you lost your mind?

307
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,026
- You bring him here?
- He's a doctor. He can help.

308
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:43,469
- Well, this is not why...
- Do you want her to die?

309
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:44,814
Come on.

310
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:53,258
- What happened?
- Gunshot wound to the abdomen.

311
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,888
Those aren't hers.

312
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,217
Come on.

313
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:10,562
- What's he doing in here?
- Danny, he's here to help.

314
00:23:10,638 --> 00:23:12,647
Tell him who did this.
He ought to know that.

315
00:23:12,705 --> 00:23:14,708
- I need him out of here.
- Danny, get out. Go.

316
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,156
- No way! She's my wife!
- Danny, they got it.

317
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:21,613
I got the bullet out,
but she's still bleeding.

318
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,959
Right upper quadrant.
It's flowing badly.

319
00:23:25,996 --> 00:23:28,434
- No, no, I padded it.
- I need you to clamp under the liver

320
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,036
so I can get a look back there.

321
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:34,801
I'm not a surgeon.

322
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:39,450
I know, but I need you to do this.

323
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,454
Here.

324
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,643
She's got a retrohepatic caval bleed.

325
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,888
It's, uh, behind the liver.
That's why you missed it.

326
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:51,312
I need lap pads, as many as you've got.

327
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,343
All right. Another one.

328
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:04,897
A crash cart. Now.

329
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,920
- Juliet, I need paddles.
- It's broken.

330
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,402
We haven't had, Jack,

331
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:14,594
we haven't had anything happen before.
We didn't-we-

332
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,009
I don't...

333
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,521
Time of death is...

334
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:03,362
She's gone.

335
00:25:34,697 --> 00:25:35,831
Take it easy.

336
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,906
- Take it easy!
- Shut up!

337
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:44,125
You love this guy?

338
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,449
What?

339
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,840
- I said, do you love him?
- Stop!

340
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,816
- Do you love him?!
- Leave him alone!

341
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,050
- Do you love him?!
- What are you doing? Stop!

342
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:04,300
Do... you... love... him?

343
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,107
Yes, I love him!

344
00:26:06,453 --> 00:26:07,560
I love him.

345
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:10,527
I love him. Please.

346
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:25,431
Lock him up!

347
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:35,562
I need to talk to you.

348
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,950
Sorry, I'm busy.

349
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:38,190
It's important.

350
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,310
Please.

351
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:44,635
You were right.

352
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:46,213
I loved her.

353
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,622
And I thought... I really thought she...

354
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,130
10 mil's a lot of greenbacks, killer.

355
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:52,664
Tends to change things.

356
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:56,243
That's why you never get attached,

357
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:58,228
'cause once you care,

358
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,473
that's when they can come at you.

359
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,412
Well, what did yours want?

360
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:06,409
I saw you the other day with...

361
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:08,497
with a woman. What did she want?

362
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,444
Somethin' I ain't got.

363
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:15,488
That all? You had yourself a good cry.

364
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,668
Mind if I go back
and see if George gets his farm?

365
00:27:20,615 --> 00:27:21,907
I need you to move it...

366
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:23,552
the money.

367
00:27:24,097 --> 00:27:25,713
The money you didn't steal?

368
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,330
We both know I did.

369
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,184
Lila's hired a P.I. She's gonna find it.

370
00:27:31,628 --> 00:27:33,732
Do this for me. You have to.

371
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,948
It's too dangerous.

372
00:27:38,184 --> 00:27:39,641
I'll be a walking target.

373
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:42,017
If you don't help me,
the Warden'll get it all.

374
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:43,259
He'll win.

375
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:45,413
Please.

376
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:57,448
Are you okay?

377
00:27:58,722 --> 00:27:59,817
Dandy.

378
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,069
Guy hits like a girl.

379
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,233
No offense.

380
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:07,242
Why did he do that?

381
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,150
Hell if I know.

382
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,414
These people ever make any sense to you?

383
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,766
What are you doing?

384
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:19,378
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

385
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,030
Hang on a second, freckles.

386
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,900
I told you the time ain't right.

387
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,444
You're the one that said we had to go.

388
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:39,972
- Well, that was before...
- Before what?

389
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:43,123
I don't know what they did to you,

390
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:45,428
but I know you're scared enough
to lie about it,

391
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,279
and that scares me more than anything
that they have done to us before.

392
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:50,381
Wait.

393
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,482
- What are you doing?
- Getting you out of here.

394
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:07,769
- Don't.
- I'm not leaving you, Sawyer.

395
00:29:07,826 --> 00:29:10,551
- I can get it open.
- You're already out. You gotta go.

396
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:12,365
You gotta leave me!

397
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,317
- What?
- Run.

398
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,953
- What did they do to you?
- You go!

399
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,348
What is that thing?

400
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:22,624
Run.

401
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:24,444
Just go.

402
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:27,840
- It's every man for himself.
- Why didn't you fight back?!

403
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,192
Tell me the truth for once in your life!

404
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:35,122
If you really love me...

405
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:37,737
Go.

406
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:44,865
I only said
that so he'd stop hitting you.

407
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:54,989
Run.

408
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:56,709
Hurry!

409
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:00,348
What the hell are you doing?

410
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,657
Damnit, Frackles, don't !
Every man for itself !

411
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:30,087
Live together, die alone.

412
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,157
You know Danny wants to kill him.

413
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:56,257
Danny can wait.

414
00:30:57,766 --> 00:30:59,508
Should I bring Shephard back?

415
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,494
I want him
to sit with her for a while longer.

416
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,770
I'm sorry that they...

417
00:31:30,744 --> 00:31:32,945
they had to put handcuffs on you.

418
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,160
I'm a fertility doctor.

419
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:49,508
I'm not used to death.

420
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:53,286
What was her name?

421
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:55,080
Col.

422
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,149
Short for Colleen.

423
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:02,567
I shouldn't-have,
I should've come to get you sooner.

424
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,012
It wouldn't have mattered.

425
00:32:04,737 --> 00:32:07,492
There wasn't any more
that you could have done. She was...

426
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:10,953
She was dead
before you put her on the table.

427
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:13,793
Are you...

428
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:16,750
are you just saying
that to make me feel better?

429
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,741
I don't...

430
00:32:26,436 --> 00:32:28,886
I don't care
about making you feel better.

431
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,610
I'm gonna take you back now.

432
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:42,229
I'm sorry for bringing you here.

433
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:47,397
Whose x-rays are those, outside?

434
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:52,981
Those are spinal x-rays, and they belong
to a man about 40 years old.

435
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,804
And whoever he is,
he has a very large tumor

436
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:57,141
on his I-4 vertebrae.

437
00:32:58,471 --> 00:33:01,480
And I just happen
to be a spinal surgeon.

438
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:04,738
So you tell me, Juliet,

439
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,630
who am I here to save?

440
00:33:45,635 --> 00:33:46,773
Is that...

441
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:49,938
art?

442
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,426
No, just an experiment.

443
00:33:59,309 --> 00:34:02,767
- Do you want some fruit salad?
- Thanks. I'm not hungry.

444
00:34:04,462 --> 00:34:06,439
You might want to wait a minute.

445
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,420
Why's that?

446
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:57,540
Good morning.

447
00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:02,066
Let's go for a walk.

448
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:31,991
I have to be honest, Ford.

449
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:36,168
When they first brought you here,
I thought you were

450
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:37,973
nothing more than a dumb hick.

451
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:39,625
Now I know better.

452
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,630
You're a dumb hick
that knows how to steal.

453
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,235
Can we just get this over with?

454
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:50,885
Yeah, let's.

455
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:55,831
You remember agent Freedman
from the treasury department?

456
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:00,333
So, what do you got?

457
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:08,250
The $10 million's in a red Bronco parked

458
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,663
in a store-it-quick facility
in Sawgrass,

459
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,582
right off 441.

460
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,808
Unit 23-C.

461
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:20,916
That's where your money is.

462
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:24,793
As agreed,

463
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:28,036
the last six years of your sentence

464
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,598
have been commuted.

465
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,190
As soon as the truck is recovered

466
00:36:32,294 --> 00:36:35,419
and the funds confirmed,
your commission will be processed.

467
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:38,021
Now how would you like that?

468
00:36:38,936 --> 00:36:41,425
I wanna set up a new account,
don't matter what bank.

469
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,342
Just make it in Albuquerque.

470
00:36:47,135 --> 00:36:49,705
Put it in the name
of Clementine Phillips.

471
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:52,975
Okay. Clementine Phillips.

472
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,927
And I want it so there's no way

473
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:59,540
she can ever find out
who the money's from.

474
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,498
Who's Clementine Phillips?

475
00:37:04,377 --> 00:37:05,579
We done?

476
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,391
Congratulations, Ford.

477
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:13,396
You just lied and cheated
your way out of prison.

478
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:16,733
You're a free man.

479
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:38,778
Not much further, James.

480
00:37:39,027 --> 00:37:40,651
Just to the top of the next rise.

481
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:47,398
What's up there?

482
00:37:47,483 --> 00:37:49,171
Something I want you to see.

483
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:55,052
"Is it that little place
you've always wanted, George?"

484
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,524
Sorry?

485
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,367
What, don't you read?

486
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:01,655
It's from "of mice and men."

487
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,012
You'd like it.

488
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,090
Puppies get killed.

489
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,673
You bring me up here to kill me?

490
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:37,760
Make that thing you put inside me

491
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,058
blow up my damn heart?

492
00:38:44,073 --> 00:38:46,082
Your heart's not gonna blow up, James.

493
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:50,859
The only thing
we put inside you was doubt.

494
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:56,711
Oh, the watch is a heart rate monitor,

495
00:38:57,591 --> 00:38:58,790
but nothing more.

496
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:02,374
Look.

497
00:39:08,034 --> 00:39:10,472
We gave him a sedative, not a pacemaker.

498
00:39:12,635 --> 00:39:14,721
How do I know that's the same bunny?

499
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,848
That you didn't just paint
an "8" on another one?

500
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:19,951
You don't.

501
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,862
You son of a bitch.

502
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:40,530
The rabbit wasn't the thing
I wanted to show you.

503
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,952
What the...

504
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:10,514
You ever been to Alcatraz?

505
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:12,210
Take the tour?

506
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:16,136
Right now you're standing
on a small island roughly

507
00:40:16,193 --> 00:40:17,782
twice the size of alcatraz.

508
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,379
And that over there,

509
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:25,497
that's your island,

510
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:28,727
the one you've come to know and love.

511
00:40:31,883 --> 00:40:33,445
i just wanted you to know,

512
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:35,813
there's nowhere to run.

513
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,263
You did all this just to...

514
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:45,828
Just to keep me in a damn cage?

515
00:40:46,273 --> 00:40:47,777
We did all this because the only way

516
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,252
to gain a con man's respect
is to con him.

517
00:40:52,591 --> 00:40:54,430
You're pretty good, "Sawyer."

518
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,611
We're a lot better.

519
00:41:04,655 --> 00:41:06,717
Funny thing is, us telling you
about the pacemaker

520
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:09,559
wasn't what kept you in line.
It was when i threatened her.

521
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,950
You work so hard to make her think
you don't care,

522
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,469
that you don't need her, but...

523
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:21,919
"A guy goes nuts
if he ain't got nobody."

524
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:26,565
"It don't make no difference
who the guy is,

525
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:28,815
as long as he's with you."

526
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:31,877
"I tell you...

527
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:36,385
"I tell you a guy gets too lonely
and he gets sick."

528
00:41:38,106 --> 00:41:41,177
- What the hell are you talking about?
- It's from "of mice and men."

529
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:43,209
Don't you read?

530
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,135
Come on.

531
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,203
Let's get you back to your cage.
