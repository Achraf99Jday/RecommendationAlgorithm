1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,169
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:04,171
You want me to save your life?

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,465
I want you to want
to save my life.

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:09,009
I just made a small incision
in ben's kidney sac.

5
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,387
Now if I don't stitch that back
up in the next hour, he's dead.

6
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:14,431
I would like for you
to go back in there,

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:16,350
put Ben under and
finish the surgery.

8
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,684
And why would I
want to do that?

9
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,020
Because I'm going to go
help your friends escape.

10
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,900
- No!
- Danny!

11
00:00:32,863 --> 00:00:36,490
Show me the way to go home

12
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:41,507
I'm tired,
and I wanna go to bed

13
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:47,048
had a little drink
about an hour ago

14
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:49,550
and it went straight to my head

15
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,671
Stop.

16
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:52,672
What, you wanna turn steering?

17
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,092
We have to go back.

18
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:55,660
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

19
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:57,341
Turn the boat around, Sawyer.
I mean it.

20
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,142
Have you lost your mind?
We just got away.

21
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:00,182
Just do it.

22
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:04,520
- Give me one good reason to turn around--
- Because we can't leave Jack behind.

23
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:11,230
Yes, we can, Freckles...

24
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:14,401
'cause that's what
he asked us to do.

25
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,360
I mean, think about it--
we go back there,

26
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:20,121
what do you think cap'n bunnykiller's
gonna do if he catches us?

27
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,330
He'll kill you.

28
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:27,210
God loves you as
he loved Jacob.

29
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:33,550
Okay. Thanks for the input.

30
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:36,760
Sorry, kiddo...

31
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,890
Jack's on his own.

32
00:01:43,816 --> 00:01:45,563
Time to get up.

33
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,353
We're moving you.

34
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,443
- Moving me where?
- Someplace else, Jack.

35
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:55,442
Why?

36
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:04,451
- So this is it, huh?
- "It"?

37
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:06,912
You just helped
me save his life.

38
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:11,590
If you're gonna kill me, please, at
least show me the respect of not calling
it "moving."

39
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:14,422
Now why would we kill you?

40
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,050
Because you're done with me.

41
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:19,221
What kind of people do
you think we are, Jack?

44
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,772
would take a pregnant woman...

45
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,982
would hang Charlie
from a tree...

46
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,523
would drag our people
out of the jungle...

47
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:32,060
would kidnap children--

48
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,150
that's the kind of
people I think you are.

49
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,661
You see this glass house
you're living in, Jack?

50
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:53,170
How 'bout I get
you some stones?

51
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:01,641
Let's do this the easy way.
What do you say?

52
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:25,080
Hey.

53
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:18,713
Dr. Jack? Hey, Dr. Jack?

54
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:22,051
Dr. Jack want soda, Dr. Jack?

55
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,441
You know I can't understand
a word you're saying, right?

56
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:40,482
Dr. Jack.

57
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,032
You're welcome.

58
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:57,851
Thank you.

59
00:05:57,986 --> 00:05:59,401
Thank you very much.

60
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:02,401
You're not from around here,
are you?

61
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,742
No. No, I'm not.

62
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,072
I'm... I'm Jack.

63
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,241
Hi, Jack. I'm Achara.

64
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,200
Achara... Achara.

65
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:38,271
Juliet grilled these for me.

66
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,981
Who's that woman?

67
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,860
That'd be the sheriff.

68
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,952
- You have a sheriff?
- Not literally, Jack.

69
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:50,112
Why are you moving
Juliet into my room?

70
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,163
'Cause she's in trouble, Jack.

71
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:01,082
Now don't try anything stupid.
You stay put in this cage, okay?

72
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:04,672
You say that like you're not watching
me from that camera right there.

73
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:09,721
Oh, right. Ben told me you got
into the surveillance room.

74
00:07:20,777 --> 00:07:23,481
Let me ask you something.

75
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,980
You risk your neck
to cut them loose,

76
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,191
and they run away and
don't ever look back--

77
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,113
Thanks for the sandwich.

78
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,582
Never thought I'd be glad to
get back to this rock again.

79
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:43,582
What are you doing?

80
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:45,790
What's it look like?
I'm heading into shore.

81
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:46,422
Why?

82
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:50,092
If we just keep going, we can circle
round. Sooner or later we'll get
to camp.

83
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,013
We can tell Locke and
Sayid what happened.

84
00:07:52,017 --> 00:07:52,802
Oh, we will, huh?

85
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,143
You got a map you ain't
showin' me, Magellan?

86
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,141
We got no food, no water,

87
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,231
and I can't steer in the dark.

88
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:02,523
- Then I'll steer.
- No.

89
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,313
You'll come ashore,
and we'll make camp.

90
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:11,781
You want to contribute? You can build
a campfire while I carry the kid.

91
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:14,663
Glad we agree.

92
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:31,592
- Sure you ain't hungry?
- No, James, I ain't hungry.

93
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,841
You shouldn't fight.

94
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,892
When the hell did you wake up?

95
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:42,020
You shouldn't fight because
you're lucky to be alive.

96
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,850
Golly! I think
he's got a point.

97
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,441
That island we were on--
is that where your people live?

98
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:55,822
- Just where we work.
- Work on what?

99
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,031
Projects.

100
00:08:57,285 --> 00:09:00,702
Oh, sure, like the "steal the
kid off the raft" project?

101
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:02,121
That was a humdinger.

102
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,083
So you don't actually
live on that island?

103
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:05,750
Nope.

104
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,423
Do you live here...

105
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,291
on this island?

106
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,920
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:17,722
And what did you do with
the people that you took...

108
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:18,970
the kids?

109
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,603
We give them a better life.

110
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,973
Better than what?

111
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,393
Better than yours.

112
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,442
There's not gonna be
any moon tonight.

113
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,950
It'll be dark.

114
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:40,372
Me and Alex used to lie
in my backyard at night,

115
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:42,490
make up names for
the constellations.

116
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,120
You can't see it yet, but

117
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:47,372
right there will be
"ursa theodorus"...

118
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,041
the teddy bear.

119
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:52,801
- You have backyards?
- Yeah.

120
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,092
Well, ain't that quaint? 

121
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:03,270
Warning.

122
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,023
Warning.

123
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:30,460
I thought you were locked up.

124
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,590
They let me out to examine Ben.

125
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,381
His vitals are low,
and he has a fever.

126
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,672
I took this about
ten minutes ago.

127
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,222
It's of his stitches.

128
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,602
They're infected, aren't they?

129
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,101
Yes.

130
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,730
Will you come look at 'em?

131
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:48,850
No.

132
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:50,100
- Jack--
- No.

133
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,732
I'm not asking you for them...
or him.

134
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm asking you as a
personal favor to me.

135
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:01,951
You... want me to
help him again?

136
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:03,240
Yes.

137
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:05,873
Are you sure about
that, Juliet?

138
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:08,410
Yes... I'm sure.

139
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,132
And this is because he said
that he would let you go home?

140
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,092
No.

141
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,382
No, I...

142
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,552
It's because I'm in trouble.

143
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,890
- Trouble? For--
- I just killed someone.

144
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:27,020
That's why they put
me in your room.

145
00:11:27,433 --> 00:11:28,487
Who?

146
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,068
It's complicated.

147
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:38,740
Well, then,
let me simplify it for you.

148
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,613
I'm not gonna help him...

149
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,162
and I'm not gonna help you.

150
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,892
Okay. Special thai dish for you.
You try.

151
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:20,693
Huh?

152
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:24,820
Very brave, very brave.

153
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,413
My brother likes you.

154
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:31,911
Well, I'm a pretty likable guy.

155
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,752
So, Jack...

156
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,591
tell me something.

157
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:40,882
Shoot.

158
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,761
Why is you don't know
how to fly a kite?

159
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:49,310
- Just never learned, I guess.
- That's very sad.

160
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,311
Well, my dad worked a lot,

161
00:12:52,777 --> 00:12:56,061
and he wasn't exactly the
kite-flying type, anyway.

162
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,773
- I mean, we never really--
- Jack.

163
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:01,241
- Yeah?
- I have no interest in your father.

164
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:05,781
Well, that's a relief, because I'm
pretty tiredof talking about him.

165
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,952
Some things are personal.

166
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:19,343
So you're in Phuket to,
um, "find yourself"?

167
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:23,881
- Why would you say that?
- You're an american.

168
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,360
I have...

169
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:46,700
a gift.

170
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:50,080
Must be one hell of a gift.

171
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,903
Oh, I was just
reading your tattoos.

172
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,073
The "five" and the
stars are very cute,

173
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:25,993
but the chinese I find...

174
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:29,910
a bit ironic.

175
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,292
- You find what ironic?
- What it says.

176
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:37,623
You do know what it says?

177
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:42,380
Yeah, I know what it says.

178
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,800
Are you sure?

179
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,970
Chinese is a very
complicated language.

180
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:50,433
It's fairly common for some things
to get lost in translation.

181
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:55,100
- I know what it says.
- All right, then.

182
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,642
Jack...

183
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,272
my name is Isabel.

184
00:15:04,865 --> 00:15:07,153
If you'll come with me,

185
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:11,453
I'd like to talk to you and
ask you a few questions.

186
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:28,012
Why don't you check on your father,
sweetheart? I know he'd appreciate it.

187
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,233
Please, have a seat, Jack.

188
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,903
As you may have gathered,

189
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:47,731
we don't live on
this little island.

190
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,821
In fact, most of us don't
really even like coming here.

191
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,952
There's been an incident
that I'm investigating,

192
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,950
and I need to ask
you some questions,

193
00:15:56,295 --> 00:16:01,041
so I was hoping you may help
me clear up a few of the...

194
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:03,001
inconsistencies.

195
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,882
Now correct me if
I'm wrong, Tom,

196
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,840
but you said,
in the midst of a surgical procedure,

197
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:14,933
Jack made several comments indicating
that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben.

198
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,600
Yeah. That's right.

199
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:20,271
Is that true, Jack?

200
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:24,152
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

201
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:30,400
The question's simple.
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben?

202
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,542
No.

203
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:41,002
No, I was lying.

204
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,582
I would've done anything
to get my friends out,

205
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,631
and turning you people
against each other

206
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,250
was my best chance
of creating chaos.

207
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:04,233
Why are you lying
for her, Jack?

208
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:18,242
I'd like to go back
to my cage now.

209
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:27,790
Who's there?

210
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:31,803
Mmm. Who do you think?

211
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:44,603
What time is it?

212
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh, it's late.

213
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:55,530
Salty.

214
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:57,991
I went for a swim in the ocean.

215
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,283
Washing the day
off of you, huh?

216
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,003
Is there something you'd
like to ask me, Jack?

217
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,290
No, not at all.

218
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:11,882
I mean... it might be nice...

219
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,592
after a month of you coming
and going whenever you want,

220
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:17,892
to find out
something about you.

221
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:27,771
There are things that happen here
that you could never understand.

222
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,992
Like your gift?

223
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,243
Yes...

224
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,201
like my gift.

225
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:08,560
Are you having
fun with me, Jack?

226
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:11,862
Oh, yeah.

227
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,363
Then stop ask questions.
Let's have fun.

228
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:39,550
What?! 

229
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:46,390
Hey... Jack.

230
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,022
Do I know you?

231
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,902
815. You're...

232
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,780
- You were the stewardess.
- Cindy.

233
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,963
What are you doing here, with them?
I thought you were taken.

234
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,420
- You were captured.
- They're not, um...

235
00:20:15,426 --> 00:20:17,132
It's not that simple.

236
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:22,800
What are they doing here right now?
What are you doing here?!

237
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,430
We're here to watch, Jack.

238
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,720
Watch what?

239
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,443
What is it, sweetheart?

240
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:41,652
She wants to know how
Ana Lucia's doing.

241
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,200
Are you serious?

242
00:20:49,338 --> 00:20:49,791
What?

243
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,420
If you've got something to watch,
Cindy, go watch it!

244
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,501
Go!

245
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,820
- Sawyer.
- What?

246
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,450
Sawyer, wake up.

247
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:31,952
He's gone.

248
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,250
Karl's gone.

249
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,580
Where?

250
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:50,600
I got it.

251
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:52,222
No, let me talk to him.

252
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,770
No, I got it.

253
00:21:54,026 --> 00:21:56,022
Boys only.

254
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:06,910
Ow!

255
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,450
What the hell was that for?

256
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:11,333
So you'd cowboy up.

257
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,081
Crying in the jungle.

258
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,422
Thought you people were
supposed to be tough.

259
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,671
I am tough.

260
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,763
Sure you are, Bobby.

261
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,933
Bobby? "The brady bunch"?

262
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,933
What the hell's
"the brady bunch"?

263
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:37,102
Okay... anyway, look, Karl...

264
00:22:39,946 --> 00:22:42,612
I been with a lot of girls...

265
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:48,203
some of 'em worth
the trouble...

266
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:49,873
some not.

267
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,243
Every now and again...

268
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,413
there's one...

269
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,961
one you name dumb stars with.

270
00:23:09,557 --> 00:23:13,010
So this girl, Sally Slingshot--

271
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:15,023
- Alex.
- Yeah.

272
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,393
You love her?

273
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,351
More than anything.

274
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:28,363
Then go back to wherever the hell
your... yards are, and get her back.

275
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,200
If I get caught,

276
00:23:33,165 --> 00:23:34,992
they'll kill me this time.

277
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,081
Well...

278
00:23:41,636 --> 00:23:44,090
at least it'll be worth it.

279
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,690
I wanna ask you something.

280
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:08,823
They're not watching anymore,
so you can tell me the truth.

281
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:11,823
Okay.

282
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:13,950
Ben--

283
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,120
why'd you save his life?

284
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:19,082
All this time--

285
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:21,423
after all he did to
you and your people--

286
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:22,753
you should hate him,

287
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:25,791
but you still fixed him up,

288
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:29,130
even after your
friends got away. Why?

289
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:30,883
You're his daughter.

290
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,343
Answer the question.

291
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:37,390
I'll answer your question
if you answer one of mine.

292
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:40,562
Where's Juliet?

293
00:24:40,817 --> 00:24:44,270
She's with the rest of them.
They're gonna read her verdict.

294
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:46,270
Her verdict?

295
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,821
And we all know
what it's gonna be.

296
00:24:48,985 --> 00:24:51,953
We're pretty strict about
killing one of our own.

297
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:55,991
Eye for an eye.

298
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,832
Who? Who did she kill?

299
00:24:57,957 --> 00:25:00,661
The man who was gonna
murder your friends.

300
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:09,963
No wonder you're so
worried about her.

301
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:13,800
If it wasn't for you,
she never would have done it.

302
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:17,050
That was three questions.

303
00:25:17,186 --> 00:25:19,723
Your turn, Jack.

304
00:25:20,525 --> 00:25:23,691
I saved your father
because I said I would.

305
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:31,400
Hey.

306
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:32,573
Hey.

307
00:25:33,957 --> 00:25:35,493
Is he still in charge?

308
00:25:36,377 --> 00:25:37,030
What?

309
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,280
Ben, your father--
is he still in charge?

310
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,661
Will that woman Isabel
do what he says?

311
00:25:41,796 --> 00:25:42,543
Yeah.

312
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,752
Get me out of this cage.

313
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:51,212
I wouldn't do that.

314
00:25:54,635 --> 00:25:57,853
The cavalry has
arrived at last.

315
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,783
I'd be much more impressed with you
people if you had a good surgeon.

316
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:19,320
We had an excellent
surgeon, Jack.

317
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:22,953
His name was Ethan.

318
00:26:24,547 --> 00:26:27,041
You have a very
serious infection, Ben.

319
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:29,631
That infected tissue needs
to be re-incised, debrided,

320
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:34,841
and you need to be very closely
monitored from here on out.

321
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:40,471
There might be nerve damage or
any number of other complications.

322
00:26:40,805 --> 00:26:42,973
You might not walk again.

323
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:48,482
Your bedside manner leaves
something to be desired, Jack.

324
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:51,901
Well, then,
it's too bad you're stuck with me.

325
00:26:53,235 --> 00:26:54,401
Am I?

326
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,321
You need a doctor, Ben,

327
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,950
someone to stay with you,

328
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,781
bring you back to good health.

329
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,620
And here we go again.

330
00:27:08,715 --> 00:27:11,921
I've already given you a
ticket off this island, Jack.

331
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:14,251
What's it gonna
cost me this time?

332
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,972
Right now,
your people are in a room deciding

333
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:21,090
whether or not to
execute Juliet.

334
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,891
You're gonna stop it.

335
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:30,900
Juliet doesn't care
about you, Jack.

336
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,031
Doesn't matter what she's done,

337
00:27:35,407 --> 00:27:38,241
no matter what you think...

338
00:27:39,916 --> 00:27:42,283
she's one of us.

339
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:48,500
Do we have a deal or not?

340
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:57,301
Does Isabel have a walkie?

341
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,932
They're already in the meeting.

342
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,981
Then get me something
to write on.

343
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,011
You following me.

344
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:34,391
What is all this?

345
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,323
This is where I work,

346
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,440
and you shouldn't be here.

347
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:45,281
This is a...

348
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:49,370
a tattoo parlor.
This was your big secret--

349
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:53,751
the envelopes... your gift?

350
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,501
I am not a tattoo artist.

351
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:06,340
I'm able to see who people are.

352
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:09,683
My work is not decoration...

353
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,563
it is definition...

354
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:15,443
and this...

355
00:30:15,818 --> 00:30:17,313
this is my gift.

356
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:19,651
So...

357
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,942
you see who people are.

358
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,701
Yes... and I mark them.

359
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,042
So tell me who I am.

360
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,963
- No.
- Why not?

361
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,923
You are an outsider.

362
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,790
So you can sleep with me--

363
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,710
I'm not allowed.

364
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:46,803
Do you see who I am, Achara?

365
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:49,010
Yes.

366
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,102
Who am I?

367
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:54,390
You are a leader,

368
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:56,142
a great man.

369
00:30:57,777 --> 00:30:59,151
But this...

370
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:03,783
this makes you lonely... 

371
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,822
and frightened...

372
00:31:07,917 --> 00:31:09,821
and angry.

373
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:19,961
Good.

374
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:24,090
Now put it on me.

375
00:31:25,056 --> 00:31:26,551
Put it on me.

376
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,053
No. This...

377
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:32,392
this is against my people.

378
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,072
There will be
consequences, Jack.

379
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:48,241
There always are.

380
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:15,601
Wait. No,
you shouldn't be here.

381
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,142
Just stand back.

382
00:32:17,315 --> 00:32:18,772
Don't say anything.

383
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:28,862
Alex, you--

384
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,822
Jack?

385
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:35,491
What the hell did you
bring him here for?!

386
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,492
Let him go, Tom.

387
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:41,463
What's going on, Alex?

388
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:44,500
This is from Ben.

389
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:58,020
Ben has commuted
Juliet's sentence.

390
00:32:58,188 --> 00:32:59,981
Execution is off the table.

391
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,403
He says the rules don't apply.

392
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:08,572
He has, however,
ordered her to be marked.

393
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:47,191
Hey, where you going?

394
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:02,450
Hey, I know you.

395
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,870
I'm Achara's friend from...

396
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:09,292
Jack from the restaurant.

397
00:34:14,138 --> 00:34:15,590
Let go of me, man.

398
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,163
You will get off our beach!

399
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:42,703
You leave this country!

400
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:44,872
Do you understand me?!

401
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,313
I heard you only
liked them grilled.

402
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:56,570
I missed the toothpicks, too.

403
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:07,501
- Let me see.
- Jack...

404
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:10,422
They marked you. Let me see it.

405
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:34,021
Break a branch off that
aloe plant over there--

406
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:35,652
- It's okay, Jack.
- Please.

407
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,322
Please do it.

408
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:54,293
All right, turn around.

409
00:37:17,948 --> 00:37:20,281
Why did you help me?

410
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,412
He told you he was
gonna let you go home.

411
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,323
He told me the same thing.

412
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:29,241
We're gonna make sure
he keeps his word.

413
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:31,503
And how are we
going to do that?

414
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,213
Together.

415
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:51,142
They'll be coming for you in
a few minutes-- all of them.

416
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,443
Your friends know where we are,

417
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:56,901
so we have to leave this island
to go back to where we live.

418
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:59,360
Go where?

419
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,783
Well, Ben calls it "home."

420
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,620
- Where's Karl?
- I let him go.

421
00:38:13,048 --> 00:38:15,371
- You what?
- I let him go.

422
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,463
He could have led us
back to where they live.

423
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:20,502
What, you think I cut him loose
'cause I'm so damn sensitive?

424
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,962
The kid's a target.

425
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,971
Ben ain't never gonna stop
lookin' for him, so as long--

426
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:29,932
all ben wants is that kid as far
from his daughter as possible.

427
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,641
Let's get back to camp.

428
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,571
Are you coming or not?

429
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,442
Should I walk beside you
or ten paces behind you?

430
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:47,872
You've gotten so good at telling me what
to do, I can't think for
myself anymore.

431
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,333
Don't take it out on me
'cause you feel guilty.

432
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:52,260
- I don't feel guilty.
- The hell you don't!

433
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:54,751
We had to leave Jack behind.
I didn't have a choice--

434
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,253
I'm not talkin' about
leavin' Jack behind.

435
00:39:01,847 --> 00:39:05,972
I'm talkin' about you and me.

436
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:16,230
I know you did it 'cause you
thought I was a dead man...

437
00:39:17,065 --> 00:39:20,523
So don't beat yourself up
'cause the doc's left behind.

438
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,862
I'm not beating myself up.

439
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,741
'Course you're not.

440
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:37,121
So now that we got that out of the way,
let's go.

441
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:07,952
"He walks amongst us,
but he is not one of us."

442
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:11,451
Your tattoos--
that's what they say.

443
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,503
That's what they say.

444
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,583
It's not what they mean.
