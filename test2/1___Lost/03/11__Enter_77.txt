00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,116
<i>Previously on Lost:</i>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,956
- Hugo, you can go back to your camp.
- What about my friends?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,272
Your job is to tell the rest of your
people they can never come here.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,148
Rest in peace, Mr Eko.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,799
And thank you for helping me find my...

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,432
I don't care what Jack said.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,318
They've got him and we have
to get him back. I owe him that.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,358
<i>The Pearl is a monitoring station</i>

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,115
<i>where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects</i>

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,997
<i>can be observed and recorded.</i>

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,710
I guess he'll be expecting us.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,949
To the left of it.
Put it over there.

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,951
A Ping-Pong table?
Where'd the hell that come from?

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,759
Jin found it when he was out
looking for firewood.

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
We made legs for it and paddles.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,118
Now all we need is a ball.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,679
Found it?

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,558
Must have landed in the jungle
when the hatch exploded.

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,950
- I thought the hatch collapsed.
- All I know is the sky turned purple.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,158
After that I don't ask questions.
I just make myself a salad and move on.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,231
Yeah, I can see that's working for you.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,039
Hey, you seen Kate around?

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,076
Wow, she's not back yet?

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,675
You guys find anything
we can use for a ball?

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,079
No.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,229
<i>That's my Guns and Ammo.
Where did you get it?</i>

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,709
It was in the magazine stack.

28
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,995
We share things now.

29
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,913
Listen, Zorro, it was in my stuff.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,958
Stuff you decided to party with
while you thought I was dead.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,112
Listen, hillbilly,
if you want it that bad, take it.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,396
Just keep it.

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,430
We need to eat.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,756
Are we still on course?

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,075
We're still heading north
on a bearing of three-zero-five.

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,754
- Yes.
- I'm sensing a lack of confidence.

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,400
We've been walking for two days
following a bearing

38
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,550
provided by the carvings on a stick.

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,349
- And?
- We're going to chance upon the Others?

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,512
I don't know what we're going
to chance on, Sayid, but...

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,831
...my bearing is
the only bearing we've got.

44
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,234
You all looking for something...
like this?

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,869
Cool, a ball.

46
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,114
We need to do
a little quid pro quo first.

47
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,751
I've been gone, you thought the store
was having a going-out-of-business sale,

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,308
but now I'm back
and I want what's mine.

49
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,709
Yeah, but it wasn't
really yours to begin with.

50
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,075
It was mine when I took it.

51
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,993
Who the hell are you?

52
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,993
And C: Because I'm fair,
I'm going to let you play me for it.

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,912
Play Ping-Pong?

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,629
That's right, Avalanche.
You bastards put up your best player.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,994
One game.

56
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,593
And when I crush them,

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,399
you all got to bring me
every piece of my stash back.

58
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,958
If you lose?

59
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,756
I ain't gonna lose, but...

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,473
...if I do...

61
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,394
...tell you what, name it.

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,468
Looks like Crouching Tiger
and Hidden Dragon got something good.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,278
Lay it on me.

64
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,595
No nicknames.

65
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,279
If you lose,
no nicknames for anyone.

66
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,430
For a week.

67
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,397
Nice.

68
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,876
You're on.

69
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,595
Pick your player.
I'll be back in an hour,

70
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,910
then let the slaughter begin.

71
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,629
Are you sure it's completely isolated?

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,397
I've circled the house.

73
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,711
There's nothing but jungle
surrounding it. Here.

74
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,473
That dish still work?

75
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,518
A dish of that size would have
broadcasting capabilities

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,511
of thousands of miles.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,430
Danielle, you once mentioned
a radio tower.

78
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,592
- Is this it?
- I have never been here before.

79
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,591
The man in the house,
seen him before?

80
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,796
On a video feed
from the Pearl Station.

81
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,239
- So who is he?
- Only one way to find out.

82
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,513
- We ask him.
- What's this for?

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,275
If I'm unarmed,
he won't feel threatened.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,079
In case he is threatened,
you can cover me from here.

85
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,759
Hey, where are you going?

86
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,037
I have no interest
in that man inside the house.

87
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,599
I have survived on the island

88
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,036
precisely by avoiding
these types of encounters.

89
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,430
I'll wait for you by the stream.

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,672
For those of you who survive.

91
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,835
Najeev. Najeev.

92
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,672
- Did you cook this?
- Yes. I did.

93
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,998
Well, it's delicious.

94
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,911
My name is Sami.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,228
Najeev. Thank you.

96
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,951
Please, sit. Sit.

97
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,839
So where are you from?

98
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,434
- I'm Syrian.
- Please.

99
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,599
What do you want from me?

100
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,519
You're an excellent cook.

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,830
And I have a restaurant...

102
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,072
...much nicer than this place.

103
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,152
Come take a look.

104
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,993
If you like it, I will hire you

105
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,310
at twice your pay here.

106
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,558
You're offering a stranger a job
because of a single meal?

107
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,153
I'm offering you a job

108
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,629
because we are outsiders here.

109
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,952
And because... my chef just quit.

110
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,512
- No, he's been hit.
- Not yet. You want to get shot too?

111
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,273
I didn't cross the line!
We had a truce.

112
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,396
This is my land.
You said I could stay here.

113
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,313
No. I am not who you think I am!

114
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,470
My name is Sayid Jarrah.

115
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,154
I was on a plane
that crashed here months ago.

116
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,231
- A plane?
- I'm unarmed. I swear.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,999
Stay right there.

118
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,429
Drop the rifle!
Drop it right now!

119
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,791
Back up. Back up.

120
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,153
Are you all right?

121
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,678
You really did crash here?

122
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,399
Over 40 of us, yes.

123
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,791
I'll go in first, make sure it's OK.

124
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,471
Who are you?

125
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,437
My name is Mikhail Bakunin.

126
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,793
And I am the last living member
of the Dharma Initiative.

127
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,198
Watch your step.

128
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,238
Please.

129
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,359
Sit.

130
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,597
Here, let me.

131
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,714
You've had experience
treating gunshot wounds?

132
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,314
I spent some time in Afghanistan.

133
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,549
I had experience with field
medicine in the Soviet Army.

134
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,237
In the kitchen on the top shelf
there is a medical kit.

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,356
Will you bring it, please?

136
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,316
It's all right, Kate.

137
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,796
- How did you get here?
- I almost don't know where to begin.

138
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,114
Why don't you begin
with the Dharma Initiative?

139
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,229
I grew up in Kiev
and joined the Soviet Army.

140
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,710
I was stationed at
a listening post in Vladivostok.

141
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,558
After the Cold War...

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,718
...after we lost the Cold War,

143
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,597
my unit was decommissioned.

144
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,400
I was dismissed
from my life in the military.

145
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,554
And after years of conducting
unpleasant actions against our enemies,

146
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,273
I found myself wanting
to do something good.

147
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,079
So I replied to
a newspaper advertisement.

148
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,438
- An advertisement?
- "Would you like to save the world?"

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,230
That's how I met them. The Initiative.

150
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,552
Very secretive. Very rich.
And very smart.

151
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,996
- So when did you come to the island?
- Eleven years now.

152
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,358
I liked computers,
communications equipment,

153
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,874
and being alone,
like a lighthouse keeper.

154
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,790
So they put me in this station.

155
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,395
- They called it "the Flame. "
- What's the purpose of the Flame?

156
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,079
To communicate with
the outside world, of course.

157
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,829
<i>Ready to play?</i>

158
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,158
<i>Ready to play?</i>

159
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,509
<i>Your move.</i>

160
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,074
What happened
to the Dharma Initiative?

161
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,392
They're all dead, of course.

162
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,315
They foolishly initiated a war
against the Hostiles.

163
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,039
A "purge," they called it.

164
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,156
And how did you survive this purge?

165
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,399
By not participating in it.

166
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,119
I told you, I like being alone.

167
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,352
And the Hostiles
allowed you to stay here?

168
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,117
After it was over,
four men appeared in the yard.

169
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,234
They offered a truce.

170
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,596
They said to imagine a line
extended all the way around the valley.

171
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,195
As long as I did not cross it,
I would be left alone.

172
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,191
Then they took two cows
and I never saw them again.

173
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,317
They weren't interested in the dish?

174
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,949
Why would they be?
It hasn't functioned for years.

175
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,076
Who are they, these Hostiles?

176
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,151
I do not know.

177
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,198
But they were here
for a long time before we were.

178
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,750
A very long time.

179
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,673
I'm looking for Sami.

180
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,552
Sami.

181
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,551
Najeev, I am so glad you came.

182
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,558
What do you think?
It's a simple place, as you can see,

183
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,596
but we have good customers.

184
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,357
Here's my wife.
She's in charge of the kitchen.

185
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,029
Amira, come meet Najeev.

186
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,313
Pleasure to meet you.

187
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,556
Are you sure this is him?

188
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,632
Yes.

189
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,157
Look, I don't know
who you think I am.

190
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,318
What did you just say?

191
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,994
I told Nadia to be polite
because you are my guests.

192
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,911
Nadia?

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,956
After Nadia Comaneci,

194
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,429
the greatest athlete
the world has ever known.

195
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,478
We have the same birthday.

196
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,513
What?

197
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,708
Excellent work, if I say myself.

198
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,792
Thank you, Mikhail.

199
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,873
Perhaps I can begin to earn your
forgiveness by offering some iced tea?

200
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,076
I will also check on your friend.

201
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,589
Don't waste your time.

202
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,875
For ten years I've tried
to defeat that game,

203
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,474
but it was programmed
by three grand masters.

204
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,516
And it cheats.

205
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,397
<i>Ready to play?</i>

206
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,792
I've played computers and I'm pretty
sure they don't know how to cheat.

207
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,633
That's what makes
being human so distinctly...

208
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,678
...wonderful.

209
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,948
What's wrong?

210
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,076
It doesn't make any sense.

211
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,517
Why would they let him stay here...
with all this stuff?

212
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,592
- All this equipment?
- Actually it makes perfect sense.

213
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,113
What are you talking about?

214
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,397
The reason they let him stay here
is because he is not Dharma.

215
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,872
He is one of them.

216
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,591
He shot you and you just let him?

217
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,636
Why are we still sitting here?

218
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,599
We are sitting here, Kate,
because I am certain he is not alone.

219
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,154
So...

220
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,513
...you really the number one
draft pick, Grimace?

221
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,354
Yep.

222
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,072
- Are we playing with the mercy rule?
- Mercy rule?

223
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,631
Yeah, like if I'm up 11-0,
then I, you know,

224
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,153
automatically win.

225
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,713
- You're gonna go up 11-0?
- No, I mean either one of us.

226
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,079
Sure. We can have a mercy rule.

227
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,192
- You want to volley for serve?
- I'll tell you what.

228
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,953
- Be my guest.
- Take him down, Hurley.

229
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,989
Come on, Hurley.

230
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,838
Zero serving zero.

231
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,554
Yes!

232
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,119
One-nothing.

233
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,113
I grow the tea myself.

234
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,633
So pardon its bitterness.

235
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,153
Any tea is good tea.

236
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,152
You know how long it's been
since we've seen ice?

237
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,239
I noticed a series of thick wires
as I walked around the station.

238
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,598
This is the hub, but they go underground
to various stations all over the island.

239
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,240
And these cables, do any of them
run into the ocean?

240
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,869
Yes, there is an underwater beacon
that emits sonar pings

241
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,439
to help guide in the vessels.

242
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,751
- By vessels, you mean submarines?
- Yes.

243
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,434
The Initiative used one
to bring us here.

244
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,832
But I imagine the Hostiles have either
destroyed or commandeered it by now.

245
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,957
That explains how they were able
to get around my position

246
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,158
- and capture our sailboat.
- You had a sailboat?

247
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,232
Until we lost it to your Hostiles.

248
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,517
That's very unfortunate.

249
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,671
Well...

250
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,876
...at least we were able
to kill one of them.

251
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,312
Why are we continuing
to play this little game...

252
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,592
...when we all know it has
moved to the next stage?

253
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,189
Get some rope.

254
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,074
Drink.

255
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,388
You were a torturer, were you not?

256
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,152
In the Republican Guard.

257
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,793
Do you not recognise...

258
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,431
...one of your victims?

259
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,717
Do you not recognise
the woman that you tortured?

260
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,995
Do you not recognise my wife?

261
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,752
No. I've never seen...

262
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,512
You've confused me with someone else.

263
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,433
Amira was arrested for harbouring
an enemy of the state.

264
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,472
She was held for three months
while she was questioned.

265
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,716
Her arms bear the scars
of those questions.

266
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,839
So I assure you, Najeev,
I am not confused.

267
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,515
My name is not Najeev.

268
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,192
I'm Sayid Jarrah.

269
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,950
I was in the Republican Guard
and, yes, I was an interrogator,

270
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,315
but I have never seen your wife.

271
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,517
Maybe she saw me at the same facility,
but I do not know her!

272
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,995
I can remember every face
of every person I've interrogated.

273
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,310
She remembers your face.

274
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,999
She remembers it so well

275
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,197
that she recognised it
from a mere glimpse

276
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,874
when we walked by the restaurant
where you worked.

277
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,556
What do you want from me?

278
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,154
I want you to admit to what you did.

279
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,677
And if you don't...

280
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,635
...you will leave this room
in that bag.

281
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,078
How do you know he isn't alone?

282
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,071
The horse outside is still saddled,

283
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,277
and the stirrups are set up
for someone shorter than this man.

284
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,399
You think the Others
sent someone to keep him company?

285
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,916
They sent someone out here
because they lost communications.

286
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,673
Maybe when the sky turned purple?

287
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,239
That would be my guess.

288
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,670
If someone's here,
they're hiding good.

289
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,911
I checked every nook
and cranny of this place.

290
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,068
Not every nook and cranny, John.

291
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,551
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

292
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,552
I have told you the truth.

293
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,117
I do not know you.

294
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,995
You tortured her.

295
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,037
No, I would never touch a woman.

296
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,995
Do you think this will do any good?

297
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,152
That this will make me confess
to something I didn't do?

298
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,800
My wife confessed to something
she didn't do.

299
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,239
She confessed when you poured
a pan of boiling oil over her arms.

300
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,675
- No. I did not. You have the wrong...
- Admit it!

301
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,432
Admit it!

302
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,080
I cannot admit
to something I didn't do.

303
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,031
That is enough for today.

304
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,957
Then I will see you tomorrow.

305
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,837
<i>Your move.</i>

306
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,909
<i>Your move.</i>

307
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,750
- What is it?
- C-4.

308
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,631
Explosive.

309
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,712
- The whole place is wired.
- Why?

310
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,078
I don't know.

311
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,237
<i>Your move.</i>

312
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,473
<i>Your move.</i>

313
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,594
<i>Your move.</i>

314
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,872
<i>Manual override achieved.</i>

315
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,795
<i>For pallet drop, enter two-four.</i>

316
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,908
<i>For station uplink, enter three-two.</i>

317
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,398
<i>For mainland communication,
enter three-eight.</i>

318
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,631
<i>The satellite dish is inoperable.</i>

319
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,518
<i>Communications are down.</i>

320
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,753
<i>For sonar access, enter five-six.</i>

321
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,513
<i>Sonar is inoperable.</i>

322
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,998
<i>Has there been an incursion
on this station by the Hostiles?</i>

323
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,152
<i>If so, enter seven-seven.</i>

324
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,428
Keep your voice low
and your hands in front of you.

325
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,911
Stop right there.

326
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,439
Put the gun on the ground... now.

327
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,195
- What are you doing?
- It's her.

328
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,076
She was there.
She was at the dock.

329
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,515
She was there when we were kidnapped.

330
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,192
She knows where Jack is.

331
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,394
Are there any more of you here?

332
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,117
Let's take her upstairs.

333
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,190
John, we're coming up.

334
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,116
- John!
- Out here.

335
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,748
This is simple. Send her over to me
and I will release him.

336
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,229
- Then we'll go our separate ways.
- Don't listen.

337
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,880
- If he's gonna kill me, I'd be dead.
- Shut your mouth.

338
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,916
- Listen to me.
- Sayid, do not let her go.

339
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,195
- I will execute you.
- He's not going to do it.

340
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,236
- Quiet, John.
- I'm keeping him alive.

341
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,276
- Mikhail!
- Calm down, everyone!

342
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,471
- Sayid.
- I'll handle this, John.

343
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,959
John.

344
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,793
Don't let her talk to him!

345
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,469
Mikhail!

346
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,471
- Stop!
- Just do it, Mikhail!

347
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,873
John!

348
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,753
Finish it!

349
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,353
Kill me.

350
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,270
Oh, come on.

351
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,116
Sorry I beat you so bad, dude.

352
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,316
Sorry you hustled me, you mean.

353
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,479
My mom had a table in her basement.

354
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,236
And I played a lot at the institu...
this place I hung out for awhile.

355
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,631
- I got kind of good.
- Hooray for you.

356
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,510
Doesn't look like that last slam caused
any long term damage to your forehead.

357
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,591
You got three points, better than zero.

358
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,477
Something you want?

359
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,869
I came to give you back
some of your stuff.

360
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,517
You're the kind of guy that needs stuff.

361
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,274
You a shrink now?

362
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,513
She'll be OK, dude.

363
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,469
Kate.

364
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,038
I know you're worried,
but she's with Locke and Sayid.

365
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,795
- She's going to be fine.
- Yeah, thanks for the pep talk, Lump...

366
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,911
It's Hurley... or Hugo, if you want.

367
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,473
Get bent, Hugo.

368
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,153
You ready to go, Locke?

369
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,798
I'll be there in a minute.

370
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,315
<i>Has there been an incursion
on this station by the Hostiles?</i>

371
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,188
<i>If so, enter seven-seven.</i>

372
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,836
Danielle! Danielle!

373
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,311
Tell me something,

374
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,472
were you ever a member
of the Dharma Initiative

375
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,755
or was everything you said a lie?

376
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,789
Of course I'm wasting my breath.

377
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,708
I was never a member, but
everything else I told you was true.

378
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,870
I moved into the station
after the purge.

379
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,793
The purge, a group of
scientists attacked your people.

380
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,758
Believe what you want,
but that is what happened.

381
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,870
Your friends, did he kill them?

382
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,635
No. They're collecting whatever
may be useful from the farmhouse.

383
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,359
And now we have our ticket
to where the Others live.

384
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,113
Where we'll find your daughter and Jack.

385
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,351
And finally, perhaps, a way home.

386
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,919
There is nothing you could do to me
that would make me lead you there.

387
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,112
I didn't say
you were our ticket, did I?

388
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,950
This is a map showing
electrical and data cabling,

389
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,793
running from the Flame, here,

390
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,792
to a place called The Barracks, here.

391
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,395
Comprised of houses,
dormitories with water and power,

392
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,119
large enough to accommodate
an entire community.

393
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,156
Sounds like a place
well worth visiting, don't you think?

394
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,072
There will come a time
when your guard is down.

395
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,752
And when it is,

396
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,308
I will not hesitate a moment
before killing you.

397
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,709
- You should know this before you...
- He's making an excellent point.

398
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,792
You have a map.
Why keep him alive?

399
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,878
After my husband and I
first arrived to Paris,

400
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,793
I was afraid to ever leave
our apartment.

401
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,953
So I would stare out the window
into the alley...

402
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,037
...and I would see this cat
looking for scraps.

403
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,877
One day some children
came into the alley

404
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,678
and trapped it in a box.

405
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,159
I watched them light firecrackers...

406
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,110
...and drop them in the box.

407
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,910
I could hear him howl
from three stories above.

408
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,037
So finally, I had a reason
to leave my apartment.

409
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,752
I rescued this cat,

410
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,035
and I brought him home.

411
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,716
He sits with me when I read.

412
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,157
He sleeps with me...

413
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,238
...and he purrs.

414
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,153
But...

415
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,716
...every once in a while

416
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,553
he will bite me or scratch me.

417
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,278
He does this...

418
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,274
...because sometimes

419
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,749
he forgets that he is safe now.

420
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,791
So I forgive him
when he bites me...

421
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,995
...because I know what it is like

422
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,150
to never feel safe.

423
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,510
And that is because of you.

424
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,836
So today...

425
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,799
...I ask only one thing of you.

426
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,396
I ask you now,

427
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,789
that you show me the respect

428
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,917
of acknowledging
what you did to me.

429
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,030
That it was you who questioned me...

430
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,313
...that tortured me...

431
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,674
...and that you remember me.

432
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,669
I remember you.

433
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,629
I remember your face.

434
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,394
Your face has haunted me
ever since I left Iraq.

435
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,591
I am sorry.

436
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,155
I am so sorry for what I did to you.

437
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,470
I am so sorry.

438
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,839
I forgive you.

439
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,550
When my husband returns,

440
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,431
I will tell him
I made a terrible mistake.

441
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,999
That it was not you.

442
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,758
And he will release you.

443
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,713
Why?

444
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,600
Why are you letting me go?

445
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,518
We are all capable of doing
what those children did to this cat.

446
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,511
But I will not do that.

447
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,068
I will not be that.

448
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,719
We should kill him, Sayid.

449
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,155
He already told us
that he would kill us.

450
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,913
No.

451
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,195
He's my prisoner.
I will decide his fate.

452
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,513
I can see you didn't find
anything worth taking.

453
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,034
Actually, I just played
that chess game again.

454
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,317
And now I realise
why you didn't want me to beat it.

455
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,553
Meaning what?

456
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,035
What have you done, John?

457
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,271
That was our one hope of communication
with the outside world!

458
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,352
The computer said if there was
an incursion by the Hostiles,

459
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,396
I should enter seven-seven.

460
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,471
So I entered seven-seven.

461
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,869
We should go.

462
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,268
If anyone's around, this explosion's
going to attract their attention.
