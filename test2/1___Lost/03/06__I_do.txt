1
00:00:00,524 --> 00:00:02,036
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:05,122
2 days after I found out I have a fatal tumor on my spine,

3
00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,225
a spinal surgeon fell out of the sky.

4
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:09,936
We had such a wonderful plan to break you, Jack.

5
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:12,542
My wonderful plan got shot to sunshine

6
00:00:12,557 --> 00:00:15,455
when you saw my damned x-rays and figured out I was dying.

7
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:17,657
You want me to save your life ?

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,841
I want you to want to save my life.

9
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,408
All I can ask is that you think about it.

10
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:15,890
Police. Open the door.

11
00:01:16,523 --> 00:01:17,244
Uh...

12
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,334
everything's all right in here.

13
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:23,771
Ma'am, we have reason to believe someone extremely dangerous is in the motel.

14
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,552
We're conducting a room-to-room search.

15
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:27,142
I'm alone, officer.

16
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:30,261
This person could be holding you at gunpoint, forcing you to say that.

17
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:31,713
Please open the door.

18
00:01:31,808 --> 00:01:33,141
I don't think I should.

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,443
Ma'am, you have three seconds before I break this door down.

20
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,292
One...

21
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,030
two...

22
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:42,893
Hey.

23
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:45,392
Wanna get it on ?

24
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:50,442
Hell, yeah.

25
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:55,780
Warning.

26
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,452
Warning.

27
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:05,910
Hey.

28
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,492
Hey yourself.

29
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:12,632
Warning.

30
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:14,392
Whatcha doing ?

31
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:16,901
Throwing rocks.

32
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:18,300
Warning.

33
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:21,263
I thought you had to pull the lever.

34
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:23,453
I know how to get a damn fish biscuit.

35
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:26,183
Then get me one.

36
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,623
What, you trying to keep me feeling productive ?

37
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:56,201
You took these blood tests, made all the notations ?

38
00:02:58,258 --> 00:02:59,772
How old are the x-rays ?

39
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:00,981
A week.

40
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,403
The tumor on your spine is borderline inoperable,

41
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:11,192
and at the rate it's growing,
that borderline goes away in about one week.

44
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:25,253
Yes.

45
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,761
Anesthesia ? Sterile ?

46
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:28,663
Yes.

47
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,293
You need to bein surgery yesterday.

48
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:42,562
All right, then.

49
00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:46,623
Whatever you need, it's yours. I'm ready.

50
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,303
No, I think you misunderstood me.

51
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:53,362
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

52
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,543
I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die.

53
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:03,052
You think I believe you people ?

54
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:06,331
You think I trust you,
that I'm gonna just do the surgery

55
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:08,483
and hope that you let me go ?

56
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:09,282
Jack...

57
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:10,992
Don't !

58
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:24,212
Well, Jack,

59
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,392
I'm very disappointed in your decision.

60
00:04:31,628 --> 00:04:32,672
Well, Ben,

61
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:37,282
at least you won't have to be disappointed for very long.

62
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,393
You shouldn't have come here.

63
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:07,100
Yeah, you're right.

64
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:12,163
I've made a huge mistake.
I am just full of regret right now.

65
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,461
Seriously.

66
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,193
It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.

67
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,873
It's bad luck to see the bride in her dress before the wedding.

68
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,063
You, my friend, are naked.

69
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,631
have you tried it on ?

70
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:34,223
I have to hold my breath to get the claspy things to clasp,

71
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,690
so I'm waiting till the absolute last minute.

72
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,410
It's in about 12 hours.
You might wanna get clasping.

73
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:49,501
Hey.

74
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:53,832
I know it's...

75
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,153
it's been fast,

76
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,462
but...  this is right.

77
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:04,563
I know it's real...

78
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:09,510
and I love you, Monica.

79
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,870
I love you too, Kevin.

80
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,830
Come on. Time for work.

81
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,253
- What about him ?
- Oh, he's got the day off.

82
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,903
Well, if he's not working, neither am I.

83
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:42,992
Oh, you're not, huh ?

84
00:06:43,015 --> 00:06:44,460
Just go, freckles.

85
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:46,923
Man wants to give me a day off,

86
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,742
let him give me a day off.

87
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:51,450
No, Sawyer. We're a team.

88
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,111
You break the rocks, I haul 'em.

89
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:55,970
All right.

90
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:57,550
Fine.

91
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:11,861
Lord knows I wouldn't want to break up the team.

92
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,813
What happened to him ?

93
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,900
Must have been an animal, maybe one of the bears.

94
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,582
Are we gonna carry him back ?

95
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:48,221
No. We're gonna bury him here.

96
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:51,112
Are we ?

97
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:55,820
The people back at camp...
there's just been a few too many funerals lately.

98
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:58,000
Nobody needs to see him like this.

99
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,183
I'll slip back to the beach and get a couple shovels.

100
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,123
- I'll come with you.
- No, I'll be back in an hour...

101
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,220
it's not safe to go alone, John.

102
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:10,733
I appreciate your concern.

103
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:22,983
So what killed Eko ?

104
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,843
Folks back at the beach call it the "monster."

105
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:31,911
I don't really have a name for it.

106
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,712
You don't believe in monsters.

107
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,870
I believe in what I can see.

108
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,123
But obviously, you have.

109
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,710
So why don't you tell me what you think it is ?

110
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:46,171
It might be what brought us here.

111
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:49,530
So you believe that this monster decided that Eko was meant to die ?

112
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,610
I believe Eko died for a reason.

113
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,360
I just don't know what it is yet.

114
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,261
Is that why you lied ?

115
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:01,692
We're not headed back towards the camp, are we, John ?

116
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:06,631
Sure, we are.
Just need to take a little detour first.

117
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:19,291
Compound breach.

118
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:20,792
Compound breach.

119
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:21,843
Where is she ?

120
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:24,601
Someone's on the grid. I want him on the ground, her too.

121
00:09:24,637 --> 00:09:26,311
If he moves, you shoot him.

122
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:29,212
Yeah, they're here.

123
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:29,932
Okay.

124
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,352
Did the doctor get out again ?

125
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:32,873
You sure ?

126
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:34,840
Well,  does he know ?

127
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:37,600
How the hell did she get over here ?!

128
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,443
Get up ! Come on ! Get up ! Go !

129
00:09:42,487 --> 00:09:43,852
Alex ! Alex !

130
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:46,530
What the hell do you think you're doing ?

131
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:47,970
What, you gonna shoot me ?

132
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,233
You know you're not supposed to be here, so let's just calm...

133
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,990
What did you do to him, Danny ?! Where is he ?

134
00:09:53,738 --> 00:09:55,433
I  want to talk to Ben.

135
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,131
Sure.

136
00:09:56,906 --> 00:10:00,370
That sounds like a great idea.
So why don't we just lower our little sling...

137
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,350
Where is he ? Tell me !

138
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,890
Don't... no ! Get off of me !

139
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,133
Get her out of here.

140
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,502
Get her outta here !

141
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:11,421
Put me down ! Listen, whatever they say, don't believe them.

142
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:15,830
They're gonna kill your boyfriend
just like they killed mine.

143
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:36,800
I don't understand. It's supposed to be two weeks.

144
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:38,154
Our schedule's been moved up.

145
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:39,814
- What, is that an order ?
- It's coming from him.

146
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:41,691
- That's stupid.
- It's not my call.

147
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:44,261
That's the way it is, Danny.

148
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:46,503
All right.

149
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,431
I would like for you to put this on and come with me, please.

150
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:56,410
You think I'm gonnaput a hood over my head 'cause you said "please" ?

151
00:10:56,457 --> 00:11:00,860
No, kate, I think you're going to put a hood over your head
because the man standing behind me,

152
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:03,150
the one who's burning a hole in my back...

153
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,120
that man is going to kill Sawyer.

154
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:09,381
But if you put this on and you come with me,

155
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:12,552
there's something you can do for us that will save his life.

156
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:56,751
Come in.

157
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:03,633
Oh, sweetheart.
You're beautiful.

158
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,722
Absolutely beautiful.

159
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,380
How is it out there ?

160
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:13,751
There are a lot of excited policemen.

161
00:12:15,095 --> 00:12:19,503
Don't worry. I have asked them not to shoot their guns in the air when you say "I do."

162
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:23,860
You know, mothers-in-law aren't supposed to be so nice.

163
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:26,353
Um...

164
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,812
Monica...

165
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:31,303
I have something for you.

166
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:35,962
Suzanne, you shouldn't have.

167
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,682
My mother gave that to me on my wedding day.

168
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,030
She told me someday I'd give it to my daughter,

169
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:46,130
but since I had four boys...

170
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:49,531
Here.

171
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:08,232
It's perfect.

172
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:14,770
You know, Kevin's been coming to the church here since he was about yea high.

173
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,510
When I first met you, Monica,

174
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:21,082
I was struck by your honesty and devotion to Kevin.

175
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:25,241
And when I asked him what he loved most about you, he said,

176
00:13:25,287 --> 00:13:27,610
"because what you see is what you get."

177
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:29,610
That being said,

178
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:31,640
we've got the rings,

179
00:13:32,306 --> 00:13:33,882
you've vowed your vows,

180
00:13:34,595 --> 00:13:37,751
and I now pronounce you husband and wife.

181
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:23,583
Step.

182
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,712
I'll give you two some privacy.

183
00:15:12,347 --> 00:15:13,252
Hey.

184
00:15:14,588 --> 00:15:15,871
You okay ?

185
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,870
Yeah. You ?

186
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:21,712
Yeah, I'M...

187
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:23,982
I'm great.

188
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,862
Where are they keeping you ?

189
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,943
Outside, in a cage.

190
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,743
Sawyer ?

191
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,872
He's in a cage, too.

192
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,983
They're making us work.

193
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,771
Work ? On what ?

194
00:15:45,106 --> 00:15:47,681
I don't know what it is, but it's big.

195
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,650
We're hauling rocks and...

196
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:54,560
Hey.

197
00:15:56,826 --> 00:15:58,312
Did they hurt you ?

198
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,462
Kate, hey.

199
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,881
Hey, it's gonna... it's gonna be all right.

200
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,422
It's gonna...

201
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:12,860
Jack,

202
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:15,951
you have to do it.

203
00:16:16,597 --> 00:16:17,353
What ?

204
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:20,050
This thing that they told you to do... this operation.

205
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:25,121
She said that if you do it, then that they would...

206
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,642
- What did they do to you ?
- Jack...

207
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,632
- What did they do to you ?
- Nothing.

208
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:31,281
How did they get you to ask me ?
What did they offer you ?

209
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:33,260
- Nothing.
- Then what are you doing here ?

210
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,553
They're gonna kill Sawyer !

211
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,841
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:48,401
I'm so sorry, but she said that if you do it,

213
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:51,090
and if you do it soon, they'll let us go.

214
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,201
And you believe them ?

215
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,063
I have to.

216
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:07,060
Jack...

217
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:09,942
please.

218
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,060
We're done here.

219
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,192
- Jack.
- Hey !

220
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,711
We're done in here !

221
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:22,211
Jack, I'm sorry.

222
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,732
You have to do this. They said that they couldn't...

223
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,501
Get her out of there.

224
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,210
Jack...

225
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:37,020
Jack, please !

226
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,153
Hey, you.

227
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:56,911
Hey, what's for dinner, gorgeous ?

228
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,610
It's taco night.

229
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,132
You're making tacos ?

230
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,761
Yes, and you better like 'em.

231
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:05,180
Or what ?

232
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,902
Or no dessert.

233
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,372
I'm leaving now. I'll be home soon.

234
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,511
Love you.

235
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,110
I love you, too.

236
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,111
Agent Mars.

237
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,721
It's me.

238
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,521
Well, I'm glad.

239
00:18:59,566 --> 00:19:03,091
I realized this morning
that it was the feast of the Ascension, and I was feeling bad.

240
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:07,241
A lot of holy days have come and gone since you last called.
I thought you and I were friends.

241
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,152
I don't want to run anymore.

242
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,900
What's his name ?

243
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,390
Does he know who you are ?

244
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:19,992
Edward, please.

245
00:19:20,566 --> 00:19:23,463
I know you don't want to spend the rest of your life chasing me.

246
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:27,741
Please, I love this guy. Just let me go.

247
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,081
I'll tell you what.

248
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:35,301
If you can really stay put,

249
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:38,200
you really settle down,

250
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,410
then I'll stop chasing you.

251
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,942
But you and I both know that's not gonna happen.

252
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,612
Sawyer...

253
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:19,131
you really care about him, huh ?

254
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:21,603
Where is he ?

255
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,791
I'm sorry you weren't able to help us, Kate.

256
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,602
Move it, Ford.

257
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,050
Danny.

258
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,413
- Danny !
- Son of a bitch !

259
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,522
Right. Sorry, Jules.

260
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:56,611
You got anything you wanna say to your girl,

261
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,052
you'd best say it tonight.

262
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:19,913
And how was your day, honey ?

263
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:25,103
When the hatch exploded,

264
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:28,432
your prayer stick fell out of a tree right on top of me.

265
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:34,132
So Sayid and I went out to get it,
because it didn't feel right to bury you without it.

266
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:38,141
I'd like to think you died for a reason, Mr. Eko.

267
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:43,261
Just hope it's not too long before we find out what the heck it might be.

268
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:59,592
Rest in peace, Mr. Eko.

269
00:22:02,018 --> 00:22:04,571
Thank you for helping me find my...

270
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:15,981
"Lift up your eyes and look north" John 3:05

271
00:22:22,878 --> 00:22:23,993
I saw Jack.

272
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,811
They brought me into see him.

273
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,581
They want him to do surgery on Ben.

274
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,642
Who  the hell's Ben ?

275
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:36,681
Henry, the guy who brought us in.

276
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:38,663
He's sick.

277
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,241
And they say that if he does it, they're gonna let us all go.

278
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,230
And you and me are what, bait ?

279
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:44,970
Somethin' like that.

280
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,000
At least the doc ain't dumb enough to do it.

281
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,801
I told him he had to.

282
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,351
Why the hell would you do something so stupid ?

283
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:56,601
To save your life.

284
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:58,543
My life don't need saving.

285
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:01,712
You wanna die ?!
'Cause that's what's gonna happen.

286
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,123
Pickett is just waiting for his chance.
I've seen him look at you.

287
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,952
Damn it, freckles, stay put.

288
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,631
And you know what he's gonna do.
So don't pretend

289
00:23:12,635 --> 00:23:14,121
like  you don't care.

290
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:16,162
Get down, freckles !
We already been through this.

291
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,380
Shut up, James.

292
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:28,002
You don't want Jack to save your life ?
Then you're gonna save your own.

293
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:29,940
We're getting outta here now.

294
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,573
Stop it ! Damn it, Kate.

295
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,581
Go. Get outta here. Run !

296
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:41,470
You're out of your cage. Why don't you run, Kate ?

297
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,220
'Cause me... I ain't running...

298
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,403
'Cause there ain't no place to go.

299
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,662
What are you talking about ?

300
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:55,073
We ain't on our island.

301
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:59,661
We're on another island, like Alcatraz, couple miles offshore.

302
00:24:00,608 --> 00:24:03,613
So unless you're a mermaid, or you got a boat,

303
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:05,962
there ain't no point.

304
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:09,043
When were you planning on telling me this ?

305
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:09,963
Never.

306
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:12,812
Why not ?! Why wouldn't you ?!

307
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:21,850
'Cause I wanted youto believe that we had a damn chance.

308
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,561
What was that for ?

309
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,960
I don't know.

310
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,260
I don't know.

311
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,173
Very  nice.

312
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,601
Okay, now it's your turn.

313
00:26:11,856 --> 00:26:13,270
Look under your place mat.

314
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,632
- What did you do ?
- Just look.

315
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:19,681
What is it ?

316
00:26:19,715 --> 00:26:22,453
You know that honeymoon I've been promising you for six months ?

317
00:26:22,607 --> 00:26:25,353
You are holding in your hand two tickets to Costa Rica.

318
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,851
So get your passport ready, baby.

319
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:31,440
Hey.

320
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:35,200
What's wrong ?

321
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,163
Nothing.

322
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:42,480
I just love you so much.

323
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:47,173
Come here.

324
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:20,573
Let me ask you something, freckles.

325
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:27,040
The day blockhead was beating on me,

326
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:28,782
and you said...

327
00:27:29,828 --> 00:27:30,990
"I love you."

328
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:32,700
That was just...

329
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,433
to get him to stop, right ?

330
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:13,360
I love you, too.

331
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:44,631
Who is this ?

332
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:47,271
Hello ?

333
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:49,992
Hello !

334
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,870
<i>Try it... the door.</i>

335
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,851
If it helps, I was surprised, too.

336
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:36,312
If I were a betting man,
I would have picked her and you.

337
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,322
Shut up.

338
00:30:41,485 --> 00:30:42,381
Well,

339
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:47,862
I suppose this would be the proverbial nailin my coffin, wouldn't it ?

340
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:57,953
Tomorrow.

341
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:00,531
Sorry ?

342
00:31:00,878 --> 00:31:02,940
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

343
00:31:05,715 --> 00:31:07,771
Get everythin gI mentioned before...

344
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,763
the instruments, the anesthesia,
and someone who can hold a damn clamp.

345
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:13,653
Yes. Of course.

346
00:31:13,698 --> 00:31:15,901
I'll get it out... your tumor,

347
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,782
and I'll keep you alive.

348
00:31:25,088 --> 00:31:26,593
But I need your word.

349
00:31:28,195 --> 00:31:30,500
I need what you promised me before.

350
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:34,622
I need to get the hell off this island.

351
00:31:40,818 --> 00:31:41,540
Done.

352
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,043
What you working on ?

353
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:46,523
Just finishing some I. R. S on that fugitive recovery out of Tampa.

354
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:49,812
That's what being a cop is... just endless paperwork.
Thank you, sweetie.

355
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:59,743
What if I told you I was a fugitive ?

356
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,953
What if I told you I was on the run for blowing up my father,

357
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:09,543
and it was only a matter of time before you found out ?

358
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:11,950
This isn't funny.

359
00:33:11,978 --> 00:33:13,703
It's not a joke.

360
00:33:15,155 --> 00:33:17,251
I almost had a baby, Kev.

361
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,360
Me. A baby.

362
00:33:21,087 --> 00:33:23,093
I can't do this.

363
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:26,021
Taco night ?
I don't do taco night !

364
00:33:26,058 --> 00:33:29,331
- Okay, calm down, Monica.
- My name's not Monica !

365
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:37,690
I love you...

366
00:33:40,448 --> 00:33:41,962
but I can't stay.

367
00:33:46,616 --> 00:33:48,660
Oh, wait. Hang on. Whoa.

368
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,062
- Kev...
- Something's wrong with me.

369
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,263
I drugged you.

370
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:56,572
You what ?

371
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:59,613
I had to. Otherwise, they would think you knew.

372
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,893
People are gonna be asking a lot of questions,
and I didn't want you to lose your job.

373
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:05,040
No, Kev !

374
00:34:44,678 --> 00:34:47,112
This is gonna be a very tricky procedure.

375
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:50,993
If I tell you to do something,
I need you to do it then and there, no questions asked.

376
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,681
Is that understood ?

377
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:57,571
You may find this hard to believe,
but I've always been very good at just following orders.

378
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:01,010
Is that a yes ?

379
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:02,920
Yes.

380
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,091
Good.

381
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:07,891
Let's go.

382
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:20,080
Do you get nervous...

383
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,132
before you do surgery ?

384
00:35:24,368 --> 00:35:25,460
I used to,

385
00:35:26,195 --> 00:35:27,873
but not anymore, no.

386
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,632
Whatever happens,

387
00:35:41,436 --> 00:35:44,012
everything will be very different, won't it ?

388
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,033
No doubt about it.

389
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,371
Juliet...

390
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:56,712
Did Alex ask about me ?

391
00:35:57,486 --> 00:36:00,140
No. We took her home last night.

392
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,041
I don't know where she is now.

393
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,592
Well, see you on the other side.

394
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm ready.

395
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:18,361
I need you to count down from 20.

396
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:20,602
20...

397
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:22,563
19...

398
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:25,961
18...

399
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:31,851
Scalpel.

400
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:49,981
Let's go.

401
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:54,630
Ben's just gone into surgery.

402
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:57,400
Ben just put his life in the hands of one of them.

403
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,550
Shephard wasn't even on Jacob's list.

404
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,180
Sawyer.

405
00:37:04,226 --> 00:37:07,101
Well, well, well, look who got out of her cage.

406
00:37:07,197 --> 00:37:09,371
You two should've run when you had the chance.

407
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:10,970
- Let's go, James.
- Don't.

408
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,330
Please.
You don't have to do this.

409
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:16,051
He's coming with me, and there's nothing you can do about it !
Step away.

410
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:23,520
Give me another hemostat.

411
00:37:42,158 --> 00:37:43,471
Swab again.

412
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,051
Clamp.

413
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:11,871
What happened ? Is he okay ?

414
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,663
His blood pressure's dropping.

415
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:15,622
Should he be bleeding like that ?

416
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,352
No. No, he shouldn't.

417
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,450
- Back away from the table.
- Jack...

418
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,810
Back away from the table now !

419
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:38,522
Can you hear me in there ?

420
00:38:38,637 --> 00:38:39,433
Yeah.

421
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:40,743
Good.

422
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:44,603
I just made a small incision in Ben's kidney sack.

423
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:48,311
Now if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour,

424
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,250
he's dead.

425
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,781
Now get in here and bring that walkie-talkie !

426
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,690
Step away !

427
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:04,091
No !

428
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:14,901
You let go, or I do her, too.

429
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:18,050
Let go !

430
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:19,802
Don't you let go !

431
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:24,903
Don't even think about it, Sawyer. You fight !

432
00:39:25,387 --> 00:39:26,503
No ! No ! Sawyer !

433
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,982
Don't ! No !

434
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,943
No !

435
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:36,301
Sawyer, please !
You get your hands off of him !

436
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:37,502
Down on your knees !

437
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:40,372
Please !

438
00:39:40,968 --> 00:39:42,710
I'll do anything you want !

439
00:39:42,757 --> 00:39:44,280
I want you to watch.

440
00:39:45,765 --> 00:39:47,203
Close your eyes, freckles.

441
00:39:47,256 --> 00:39:48,342
You get up.

442
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,101
Close your eyes !

443
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,401
Don't you give up !

444
00:39:56,257 --> 00:39:57,761
No ! No !

445
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:04,031
This is for Colleen, you son of a bitch !

446
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:05,112
No.

447
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,812
<i>Danny, are you there ?
Pick it up.</i>

448
00:40:16,996 --> 00:40:19,140
<i>Pick iup, Danny.
Pick it up, damn it.</i>

449
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,620
I'm here ! What ?!

450
00:40:22,677 --> 00:40:24,650
<i>You anywhere near the cages ?</i>

451
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:26,981
Yeah, you could say that.

452
00:40:27,028 --> 00:40:28,710
Give your walkie to Kate.

453
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:30,441
Now why the hell would I do that ?!

454
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:38,993
Because if you don't, the doctor's gonna let Ben die.

455
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:41,462
What are you talking about ?
What's that beeping ?

456
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,930
Just hand her the damn walkie, Danny.

457
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:49,640
Do it ! Just do it now !

458
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:57,832
Let go of her !

459
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:00,922
Jack !

460
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:02,662
Jack ?

461
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:15,902
Kate...

462
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,352
you have about an hour head start before they come after you.

463
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:23,742
Wait. Where are you ?
Where are you ?

464
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,681
You remember what I told you on the beach the day of the crash ?

465
00:41:30,848 --> 00:41:33,721
Do you remember what story I told you when you were stitching me up ?

466
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:36,830
Do you remember it ?!

467
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:39,020
Yes ! Yes, I remember !

468
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,232
When you get safe,

469
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:47,081
you radio me and you tell me that story.

470
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,300
Jack, please.

471
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,403
If I don't get a call from you in the next hour,

472
00:41:55,428 --> 00:41:57,850
I'm gonna know something went wrong, and he dies !

473
00:42:01,357 --> 00:42:03,023
I can't leave without you !

474
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,211
Yes, you are. Go.

475
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:06,462
- Jack, I can't !
- Go ! Now.

476
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:07,650
I can't !

477
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,540
Kate, damn it ! Run !

478
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,800
