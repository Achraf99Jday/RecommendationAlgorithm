Lost...

2
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:03,479
I think Michael has been compromised.

3
00:00:03,557 --> 00:00:05,218
This camp Michael is leading you to--

4
00:00:05,316 --> 00:00:06,958
that is where they will set their trap.

5
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:09,052
- And I can go ashore undetected.
- How?

6
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,844
We will sail the boat and scout them.

7
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:13,326
This time they will know
that we are coming.

8
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,380
Hi, Jack.

9
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,276
- I'm Juliet.
- Where are my friends?

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,127
Tell me where my friends are!

11
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,227
My husband says it's time to leave.

12
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,156
He doesn't think Jack
and the others are coming.

13
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,599
It's been over a day
since we lit the fire.

14
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:42,814
They should be here by now.

15
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,338
Jack knows we're out here.

16
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:46,469
He's counting on our signal.

17
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,586
Perhaps he's not able to see the smoke.

18
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,369
If he's north of us,
the mountains would block his view.

19
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,949
We need to sail forward along the coast,

20
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,343
Clear the mountains
and start another signal fire.

21
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,965
I told Jack I would light a fire.

22
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,704
I'm not abandoning him.

23
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,991
My husband thinks
we have to do as he says,

24
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,868
Because he's the only one
who knows how to sail.

25
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,225
But he's wrong.

26
00:03:43,628 --> 00:03:45,035
I can help you sail the boat.

27
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:07,878
Are you feeling any better?

28
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,690
I made the soup myself,

29
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:19,398
but I won't take it the wrong way
if you don't like it.

30
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,069
You never made soup for me.

31
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,364
Am I interrupting something?

32
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,221
Would it really matter if you were?

33
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,041
We have a situation.

34
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,735
Brian radioed in.
The Iraqi found the decoy village.

35
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:12,551
Good. It's what we wanted.

36
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:14,564
Brian followed him back to the shore.

37
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,461
Ben, they have a sailboat.

38
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:18,860
- How?
- I have no idea.

39
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,932
So they have a boat.

40
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,769
Sailing in circles will keep them busy.

41
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:24,019
They could find us.

44
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:37,434
- Within the hour.
- Then don't waste time talking to us.

45
00:05:42,647 --> 00:05:43,693
Hey, Colleen.

46
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,074
I want that boat.

3x02 - The Glass Ballerina

50
00:06:16,738 --> 00:06:17,891
Nice alarm clock.

51
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:20,001
I've woken up to worse.

52
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,862
You want half a fish biscuit?

53
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,139
- What's this?
- Lunch.

54
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,076
We're gonna need you
to keep up your strength.

55
00:06:46,134 --> 00:06:47,503
Is that right?

56
00:06:55,746 --> 00:06:57,471
- Danny, wait.
- Hold up.

57
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,512
They have a boat.

58
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,670
<i>Ben wants us to take the galaga</i>

59
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:03,823
<i>and retrieve...</i>

60
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:05,777
Okay. Be careful out there.

61
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:14,705
What are you looking at?

62
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:32,889
What's wrong?

63
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,404
What's wrong is I'm married.

64
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:40,665
Right.

65
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:42,737
That.

66
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:30,701
I don't want to share you anymore.

67
00:09:34,217 --> 00:09:35,614
Your english is excellent now.

68
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,321
We can go to america.

69
00:09:42,557 --> 00:09:44,219
- Does anyone know you're...
- No.

70
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,379
All right, here's the jig.

71
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,363
See these rocks here? That's where you two come in.

72
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,794
You're gonna chop 'em loose,

73
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,774
and you're gonna haul 'em outta here.

74
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,552
You expect me to work in this dress?

75
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,822
It's up to you.

76
00:10:51,507 --> 00:10:53,071
You can take it off if you want.

77
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,491
How dare you?

78
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:04,814
Now if you need anything,
you raise your hand.

79
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,795
- You get ten minutes for lunch--
- I got a question, boss.

80
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,742
- No questions.
- She got to ask a question.

81
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,271
If you try to run off,
you will be shocked.

82
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:15,663
Shot? Don't we even get a warning?

83
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:17,086
Shocked. I said shocked.

84
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:18,959
If you talk to each other,
you'll be shocked.

85
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:20,614
You touch each other,
you'll be shocked.

86
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,434
If you're slacking,
you're gonna get shocked.

87
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:24,840
Matter of fact, you do anything at all
that pisses me off,

88
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:26,384
you're gonna get shocked.

89
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,729
Okay? Let's get to work.

90
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,954
I'm not doing anything until I see Jack.

91
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:43,082
Now that was a quarter charge.

92
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:44,900
You got any more questions?

93
00:11:55,311 --> 00:11:56,650
Soon as you're able to walk,

94
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,798
wheelbarrow's right over there.

95
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:32,998
Why should there be a dock
all the way out here?

96
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:36,421
Others.

97
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,333
The dock's decaying. It's overgrown.

98
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,998
It looks like it hasn't been used
in quite some time.

99
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:43,992
Whoever built it, they're not here now.

100
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,813
Let's bring the boat in.
We'll tie to the dock

101
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:50,378
and build a fire on the beach.
The visibility's excellent,

102
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:54,072
And Jack will be able to see us
from miles around.

103
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:00,583
Safe?

104
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:03,808
Yes, Jin. Of course it's safe.

105
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,708
Get back to work.

106
00:15:38,008 --> 00:15:39,434
Whatever you say, boss.

107
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,144
Careful.

108
00:16:01,457 --> 00:16:03,236
Don't let them see you talking to me.

109
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:09,245
Are they keeping you in the cages?

110
00:16:10,985 --> 00:16:12,821
Did you see another guy
in there with you?

111
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,786
About my age, named Karl?

112
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:17,972
No. It's just Sawyer and me.

113
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:21,640
You're not even supposed
to be in that cage.

114
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,699
What are you talking about?

115
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:26,477
Who are you?

116
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,511
Where'd you get that dress?

117
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:34,103
They gave it to me.

118
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,968
It's mine.

119
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:38,696
You can keep it.

120
00:16:39,947 --> 00:16:41,510
It looks better on you anyway.

121
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:43,273
Wait. Wait.

122
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,904
Having fun yet, freckles?

123
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:49,932
Quit staring at my ass.

124
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:53,978
Give me something else to stare at.

125
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:58,623
Shut up!

126
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,287
Yes, sir, boss.

127
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:13,429
Thank you.

128
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,482
What else can I do?

129
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,277
Help your husband.
We need as much wood as we can find.

130
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:24,899
We're building quite a large fire.

131
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:27,811
We have to make sure
Jack will see the smoke.

132
00:17:33,278 --> 00:17:35,154
Why are you lying to me, Sayid?

133
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:39,668
And what would you know
about lying, Sun?

134
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:47,050
You're putting our lives in danger.

135
00:17:51,964 --> 00:17:54,094
I'm fairly certain
our friends have been captured.

136
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,395
There are tracks all over the dock.

137
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,539
They're fresh, as recent as yesterday.

138
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:03,161
You said this dock was abandoned.

139
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,298
That would be part
of the lying you mentioned.

140
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,947
You're not building
this fire for our people.

141
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,253
You're building it for the others.

142
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,611
I suspect that when they see the smoke,

143
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,230
they'll send
a scout party to investigate.

144
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,086
By then it will be night.

145
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,178
When they arrive, I'll ambush them.

146
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,151
I'll take two of them hostage,

147
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:29,135
- and I'll kill the rest.
- Two?

148
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,203
One to make the other cooperate.

149
00:18:39,936 --> 00:18:41,082
What do you need me to do?

150
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:42,867
I'm sorry,
but I'm going to have to ask you

151
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:44,846
to lie to Jin for another 20 minutes.

152
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,422
Why?

153
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,377
Because once the fire is lit,

154
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:55,448
it will be too late to go back.

155
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:43,329
Gun.

156
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:47,394
I don't think I understand.

157
00:22:02,918 --> 00:22:04,208
What is it?

158
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,928
He knows what we're doing.

159
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,097
He knows it's a trap.

160
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:20,243
He says he understands english

161
00:22:20,827 --> 00:22:22,371
etter than I think he does.

162
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:29,658
He knows I betrayed him.

163
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,325
Gun.

164
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:39,138
Can you handle one of these?
It's an automatic--

165
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,698
I think you'll be safer on the boat.

166
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,495
If by chance they get past us,

167
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,039
there's another gun.

168
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,986
It's inside the blue tarp
beneath the galley counter.

169
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,686
If they get past you,

170
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,057
that means my husband is dead...

171
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,489
and I won't care anymore.

172
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,795
As I said,

173
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,301
lhe gun is inside the tarp.

174
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,176
- Back off!
- James.

175
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:05,857
Put the gun down...

176
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,242
right now.

177
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:12,577
Put the gun down.

178
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,941
I don't think they're coming.

179
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:55,887
I want you to let me off this boat.

180
00:29:57,993 --> 00:29:59,107
I can't do that.

181
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,467
- Why not?
- That's not my decision to make.

182
00:30:06,986 --> 00:30:09,057
You realize there are five
of my friends up there--

183
00:30:09,116 --> 00:30:10,350
Lower your voice.

184
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,384
- I'll shoot.
- No, you won't, Sun.

185
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,542
I know you, Sun-Hwa Kwon.

186
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:26,160
And I know you're not a killer.

187
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:29,707
Despite what you may think,

188
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:31,962
I am not the enemy.

189
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,203
We are not the enemy.

190
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,238
But if you shoot me...

191
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,508
that's exactly what we'll become.

192
00:30:43,998 --> 00:30:45,460
I will. I'll shoot you.

193
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,600
Sun!

194
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,653
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

195
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,445
And please communicate to your husband,

196
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,518
the next time, I will listen to him.

197
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:33,672
We should go.

198
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,603
We have a long walk ahead of us.

199
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,656
You okay?

200
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:13,863
Never better.

201
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,081
What the hell were you thinking?

202
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:21,556
I couldn't help myself.

203
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:26,129
You just looked so damn cute
swinging that pickax.

204
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,312
Chain gang looks good on you, freckles.

205
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,134
Sawyer.

206
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:44,051
Two of those guards
got some real fight in 'em.

207
00:35:44,148 --> 00:35:46,231
Rest of 'em,
I ain't that much worried about.

208
00:35:47,176 --> 00:35:50,645
That heavyset guy
packs a hell of a punch.

209
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,477
Shaggy-Haired kid's got
some sort of martial arts training,

210
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,755
but I think
I could take him if I had to.

211
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:01,057
Oh, and F.Y.I.,
those zapper things got a safety on 'em.

212
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:06,509
Did you see the look on their faces
when you got a hold of that rifle?

213
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,691
I'm guessin' most of these boys
never seen any real action.

214
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:19,497
But that blonde
who had a gun to your head...

215
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,216
she woulda shot you, no problem.

216
00:36:25,153 --> 00:36:26,643
Why'd she call you James?

217
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:33,750
'Cause that's my name.

218
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:38,445
I noticed somethin' else, too.

219
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:42,197
You taste like strawberries.

220
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,349
You taste like fish biscuits.

221
00:36:57,244 --> 00:36:58,671
So what do we do now?

222
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:00,860
Well, shortcake...

223
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,227
now we wait for these bastards
to make a mistake.

224
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:10,033
<i>Sooner or later,
they're gonna let their guard down.</i>

225
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,758
<i>And when they do,</i>

226
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:15,137
<i>we're gonna be there
to put 'em in their place.</i>

227
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,033
Hello, Jack.

228
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:47,192
You know what's crazy Jack?

229
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:51,444
A week ago, you and I
were in exactly the opposite situation.

230
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:55,694
I was the one locked up, and
you were the one coming in for visits.

231
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:04,131
And I know that you were angry,

232
00:38:05,044 --> 00:38:07,253
that I lied to you
about who I was, but...

233
00:38:08,935 --> 00:38:11,593
Hell ! Do you blame me?

234
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:14,118
I mean, let's face it.

235
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,209
If I'd have told you
I was one of those people,

236
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,195
that you and your friends have been
calling "others" all this time,

237
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,849
it would've been right back
to Sayid and his...

238
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:26,518
fists.

239
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,578
Wouldn't it?

240
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,148
What do you want from me?

241
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:38,557
I want for you to change your...

242
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,199
perspective.

243
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,694
And the first step in doing that
would be for me to...

244
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:48,202
be decent enough
to introduce myself honestly, so...

245
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,807
Hi.

246
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:02,715
My name is Benjamin Linus,

247
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:05,746
and I've lived
on this island all my life.

248
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:18,177
You're not gonna shake?

249
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:31,286
Bring it in, please.

250
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,139
Where are Kate and Sawyer?

251
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,047
They're fine, and they're close.

252
00:39:39,131 --> 00:39:40,929
That's all I'm able
to tell you right now.

253
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,969
You can tell me anything you want.

254
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:44,432
Fair enough.

255
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,420
It's all I want to tell you.

256
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:52,874
I'm gonna make this really simple, Jack.

257
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:55,795
If you cooperate,

258
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,929
we send you home.

259
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:01,670
Cooperate with what?

260
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,122
- When the time is right, I'll tell you.
- You tell me now.

261
00:40:04,142 --> 00:40:05,569
Patience, Jack.

262
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:08,350
- Patience.
- Home.

263
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,906
Is that where you sent Walt and Michael?

264
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,866
Yes.

265
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,488
If you could leave this island,

266
00:40:21,605 --> 00:40:22,904
why would you still be here?

267
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,800
Yes, Jack. Why would we be here?

268
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,110
You're lying.

269
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:31,543
You're stuck here just like we are.
You dont have any...

270
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:34,665
Your flight crashed
on september 22, 2004.

271
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,527
Today is november 29th.

272
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:39,244
That means you've been
on our island for 69 days.

273
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:42,048
And, yes, we do have contact
with the outside world, Jack.

274
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:44,432
That's how we know
that during those 69 days,

275
00:40:44,491 --> 00:40:47,306
your fellow americans
reelected George W. Bush,

276
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,061
Christopher Reeve has passed away,

277
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,769
Boston Red Sox won the world series.

278
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,697
What?

279
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:03,478
If you wanted me to believe this,

280
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:06,740
you probably should've picked
somebody else besides the Red Sox.

281
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,573
No, they were down three games to none

282
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,527
against the Yankees
in the league championship,

283
00:41:10,565 --> 00:41:12,255
and then they won eight straight.

284
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,465
Sure, sure. Of course they did.

285
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:27,463
<i>back to Foulke.</i>

286
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,141
<i>Red Sox fans have longed to hear it.</i>

287
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:34,016
<i>The Boston Red Sox are world champions!</i>

288
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,430
<i>A clean sweep of the St Louis Cardinals,</i>

289
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,370
<i>and the Red Sox celebrate in the middle
of the diamond here at Busch stadium.</i>

290
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,670
That's home, Jack, right there
on the other side of that glass.

291
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,180
And if you listen to me,
if you trust me,

292
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,420
if you do what I tell you when
the time comes, I'll take you there.

293
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,370
I will take you home.
