1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:01,960
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,045
We think you're special.

3
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,672
We want you to lead a team of highly trained people.

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,757
How was the interview?

5
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,967
Why would I want to go all the way to Portland

6
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:11,345
for research that doesn't even work?

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,014
Because it does work. I'm pregnant.

8
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,436
My whole life, all I've ever wanted was to have a baby, and now because of you, I can.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,729
I know that you don't care,

10
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:25,440
but the people I spent the last three years of my life with-- they just left me.

11
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,065
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:29,271
- She is not coming with us.
- Yes, she is.

13
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:32,780
- Why?
- Because they left her behind, too.

14
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,192
It's getting late.

15
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,690
This is a good place to make camp.

16
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,910
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll go with you.

17
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,150
Do you wanna talk about it?

18
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,020
Talk about what?

19
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:55,073
About the week you spent over there with them.

20
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:00,412
Well, after you left, I'd, uh...

21
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:03,120
I'd made a deal with them--

22
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,870
if I took care of Ben, that they'd let me off the island.

23
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,291
I don't know.

24
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:10,133
I just kept my head down, did what I was supposed to,

25
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:12,041
and I didn't ask any questions.

26
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,632
And that's it?

27
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:18,510
That's it.

28
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:41,662
Okay. Let's have it.

29
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:47,041
I want to know what you people are doing on this island,

30
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:50,621
why you're terrorizing us, making lists,

31
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,671
kidnapping children.

32
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,421
I want to know everything.

33
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,421
But the first thing I'd like to know is...

34
00:03:00,437 --> 00:03:02,180
who are you?

35
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:16,943
Hi. I'm Juliet Burke.

36
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,112
I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.

37
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,990
I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.

38
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:22,701
Thank you.

39
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,831
Wow.

40
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:31,371
I think they're taking this whole "corporate secrecy" thing a little too seriously.

41
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:33,460
I'm never gonna fit in with these people.

44
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:40,421
Thank you.

45
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,223
Ah, you managed to find us.

46
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:50,392
I didn't even know they had an airport out here.

47
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:51,811
I know. It surprises everyone.

48
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:53,313
Hi. You must be Rachel.

49
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,312
- Richard Alpert.
- Nice to meet you.

50
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,111
Thank you for letting us borrow your sister for a few months.

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,402
Just promise me you'll bring her back in one piece.

52
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:01,651
Well, we'll do our best.

53
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:06,660
It's a... a security thing, you know? We have to take you in the rest of the way, so...

54
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:10,622
whenever you're ready, we'll be waiting right over here,

55
00:04:10,795 --> 00:04:13,291
but please take your time. Pleasure to meet you.

56
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:14,673
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

57
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:24,930
- It's better this way.
- Is this a mistake?

58
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:27,182
I shouldn't go. What if you get sick again?

59
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:28,971
I won't. The cancer's gone,

60
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:33,603
and I'm 100% preggers, thanks to you.

61
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,190
- I'll be back...
- Yes, I know.

62
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,110
Before you give birth. I promise.

63
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:40,781
- I know. Don't worry about us, okay?
- Okay.

64
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,613
You spent your whole life working to get here,

65
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:46,573
so don't blow it.

66
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:52,003
- I love you.
- I love you.

67
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:02,843
- Okay.
- Go make us proud.

68
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,823
Who are you?

69
00:05:25,156 --> 00:05:27,662
If I told you who I was,

70
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,783
if I told you everything that I know,

71
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,413
you'd kill me.

72
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:37,041
What do you think I'll do if you don't?

73
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,670
Leave her alone.

74
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,881
Sooner or later, she'll answer my questions.

75
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,431
She'll answer your questions when she's ready,

76
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,011
and you'll wait until she is.

77
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:56,143
She's under my protection.

78
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:49,781
Claire?

79
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:54,450
Claire? Claire?

80
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,410
Oh, oh, what is it?

81
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:57,752
Oh, it's okay.

82
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,370
Shush. I know.

83
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,130
Claire, hey.

84
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:06,380
Claire, you okay?

85
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:11,301
Charlie. What's-- what's going on?

86
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:12,852
Didn't you hear Aaron?

87
00:07:13,106 --> 00:07:15,390
- Is he okay?
- No, he's okay, he's okay.

88
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,562
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just...

89
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,021
I just feel a little bit off. I didn't sleep well.

90
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,483
I can't believe I didn't hear him crying.

91
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:26,023
Well, maybe you're coming down with something.

92
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:29,823
But why don't you let me take Aaron, and you get some more rest?

93
00:07:30,747 --> 00:07:32,991
- Yeah. Do you mind?
- Absolutely.

94
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:37,331
I won't sleep... long.

95
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:52,593
I guess it's no use asking them to wait up, huh?

96
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:56,221
They'll come around. Just give them some time.

97
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,850
My people kept Sayid chained to a swing set for three days.

98
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,851
Then I dragged Kate into the jungle,

99
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,062
handcuffed myself to her and lied about it.

100
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,982
How much time do you think they need?

101
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:10,153
We'll be back to our beach in a couple hours.

102
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,741
They'll probably be over it by then.

103
00:08:14,915 --> 00:08:16,033
You nervous?

104
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,911
Hell, yes.

105
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:24,332
I know that, uh, six months sounds like an eternity,

106
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:27,090
but you're gonna be amazed at how time flies once you're there.

107
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,133
I can't wait to find out where "there" is.

108
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:33,761
Dr. Burke, wanna have a seat? I'd like to take some of your vitals,

109
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:35,471
if that's okay with you.

110
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,601
Yeah, sure.

111
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:44,810
Everyone at the company is really excited about you coming down, Dr. Burke,

112
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:48,570
and I think your research is really gonna have a major impact on us.

113
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,281
What is that?

114
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:03,580
That is orange juice with a considerable amount of tranquilizer mixed in.

115
00:09:04,926 --> 00:09:06,080
You want me to drink it?

116
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,880
Oh, yes. You're gonna want to be asleep for the trip, Dr. Burke.

117
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,960
It can be kind of intense.

118
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:16,183
Okay. I was fine with signing all of your paperwork,

119
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,510
fine with agreeing to not talk to anyone in my life for six months,

120
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:22,351
fine with the fact that no one in the medical community

121
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,431
has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience--

122
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,600
- Why were you fine?
- What?

123
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:31,782
Why were you fine with those things? It seems like quite a leap for a job opportunity,

124
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,610
and we're not paying you that much.

125
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,531
I think you're fine because deep down,

126
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,002
a part of you knows that the place we're taking you to is special.

127
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,420
Special, huh?

128
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

129
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:51,963
You took a woman--

130
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,710
your own sister--

131
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,801
whose reproductive system was ravaged by chemotherapy,

132
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:59,930
who was sterile, and you made her pregnant.

133
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,641
You created life where life wasn't supposed to be.

134
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:08,101
That's a gift, Juliet. You have a gift.

135
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:12,520
Now don't you feel you're meant to do something significant with it?

136
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:18,490
Where we're going, you can do just that.

137
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,832
Where exactly are we going?

138
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,161
I can't tell you that,

139
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:28,252
but what I can tell you is that you'll see things there

140
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,791
that you never imagined.

141
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,302
Now no one is forcing you to do anything,

142
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:39,013
so if you change your mind, we're happy to take you back to--

143
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:50,650
Um, you probably shouldn't have drunk that so fast.

144
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:09,505
Good morning.

145
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,341
No, no, it's okay. You'll be hoarse for a few hours,

146
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,210
but it gets better as the day goes on.

147
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,932
Sorry I had to strap you in, but the last leg is always a little bumpy.

148
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,970
Watch your head.

149
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:24,301
Give me your hand.

150
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,871
We're here.

151
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,742
Here where?

152
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,683
Hello, Dr. Burke.

153
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,231
My name is Benjamin Linus.

154
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm really looking forward to working with you.

155
00:13:04,536 --> 00:13:05,740
Watch your step here.

156
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:18,632
Hey, whoa, that's too much water.

157
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,000
It's gonna be all soggy.

158
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:21,923
It's oatmeal, dude. It's supposed to be soggy.

159
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,222
Well, if it ain't three men and a baby.

160
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,050
I counted Hugo twice.

161
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,353
Oh, what?

162
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:31,810
Come on. I used your name.

163
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:39,652
Hey... does anybody know where there's any aspirin?

164
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,073
Claire, you don't look so good.

165
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,442
Hey, what are you doing up? You're meant to be in bed.

166
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,862
Yeah, no, I know. I just...

167
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,282
my head is pounding.

168
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,910
I got you covered. Two aspirin coming right up.

169
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,203
Thank you.

170
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,462
Son of a bitch.

171
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:10,101
Jack. It's Jack!

172
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,550
Sayid!

173
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:50,050
Hurley!

174
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,232
Doc.

175
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,220
What the hell is she doing here?

176
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:57,203
Hey.

177
00:15:59,047 --> 00:15:59,660
Hey.

178
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,593
So...

179
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:09,051
you're, like, one of them, huh?

180
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,721
I'm Juliet.

181
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,800
I don't remember you from the dock...

182
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,022
where you put bags on our heads...

183
00:16:19,607 --> 00:16:22,142
after you shocked us.

184
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,362
I had the day off.

185
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,323
So I hear you're a doctor.

186
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,282
I'm really more of a researcher.

187
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:38,953
Uh-huh.

188
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,712
They send you over here to keep an eye on me?

189
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:49,380
Okay.

190
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,513
The last one of you guys that came over here-- Ethan...

191
00:16:56,938 --> 00:16:58,683
he kidnapped Claire,

192
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,311
and Charlie got upset.

193
00:17:04,236 --> 00:17:06,020
We buried him over there.

194
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,630
She's gone, juliet. She's dead.

195
00:17:39,815 --> 00:17:42,271
It's okay. You tried.

196
00:17:48,656 --> 00:17:50,070
Why don't you go ahead and take off?

197
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,323
I'll talk to Ben.

198
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:13,341
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

199
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,310
She knew she was taking a risk.

200
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:25,682
I think it happens at conception,

201
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,772
and if that's the case, there's nothing I can do about it, at least not here.

202
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,072
- I'm not sure I understand.
- The only way to see if I'm right

203
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:35,532
is to take a woman off the island, back to Miami.

204
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:38,163
No. You're not taking anybody off the island.

205
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,370
In that case, there's nothing more I can do.

206
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:49,333
I know you put a lot of faith in me, Ben,

207
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,293
and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

208
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:56,342
My sister's giving birth in three months...

209
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,932
and I haven't even been able to call her.

210
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:05,180
It's time for me to go home.

211
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:14,021
Your sister won't be giving birth in three months, Juliet.

212
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:21,451
She'll be dead before then. Her cancer's back.

213
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,891
Where did you get this?

214
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,693
Mikhail. I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner.

215
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,311
I just didn't see what good it would do--

216
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,271
What good it would do?! I could have gone home! I could have been with her!

217
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:57,441
You still can. You can go home, Juliet,

218
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,612
be with her in her final days,

219
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:04,070
or you can stay here and help me with our problem.

220
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,992
Why would I stay?

221
00:20:06,128 --> 00:20:09,080
Because if you do, I will cure your sister's cancer.

222
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:13,420
- I'm supposed to take that on faith?
- You've been here for six months.

223
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:17,343
You've done extensive workups on all of us. Have you seen even a trace of cancer?

224
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:21,682
That's here, and being that you won't let me bring my sister here, I'm gonna need more--

225
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,680
Jacob said he would take care of it himself.

226
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,762
Unless, of course, you don't have faith in him.

227
00:20:29,608 --> 00:20:31,980
Every woman on this island needs you.

228
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:35,611
If you choose to stay, I promise you,

229
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,782
we will save Rachel's life.

230
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,740
Trust her? She's one of them.

231
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,540
Not anymore. They left her behind.

232
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,002
- Oh, yeah? Where'd they go?
- I told you. I don't know.

233
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:54,540
- Maybe we better ask her.
- She doesn't know either.

234
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,753
Here's a wacky idea. Let's sic our resident iraqi on her,

235
00:20:57,927 --> 00:20:59,843
let him do what he does, then see what she says.

236
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:02,842
- No. I don't do that anymore.
- Well, ain't that convenient?

237
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:05,090
But I don't trust her, Jack.

238
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:08,311
If she's so innocent why won't she answer our questions?

239
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,143
Just give her some time. She's afraid.

240
00:21:10,397 --> 00:21:11,310
How much time?

241
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:13,522
Look, the fact that I trust her should be enough.

242
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:14,730
It's not.

243
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,652
- Where did Locke go?
- He went with them,

244
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,690
right after he destroyed the sub--

245
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,700
the sub that was gonna take me off this island.

246
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,452
- What?
- They were gonna let you go?

247
00:21:25,746 --> 00:21:27,370
- Yeah.
- Said who?

248
00:21:27,826 --> 00:21:29,660
Ben.

249
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,042
Ben...

250
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:33,163
whose life you saved.

251
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,830
Sawyer, lay off.

252
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,082
Shoulda let that bug-eyed bastard die.

253
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,672
- He did it for us.
- Sounds like he did it for him.

254
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,591
- James.
- Is there something you wanna ask me, Sawyer?

255
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:44,513
Yeah, Jack. I wanna ask you why you're fighting every single one of us and sticking up for one of them?

256
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:48,801
Look, I spent every moment over there trying to find a way off this island.

257
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:49,351
Claire?

258
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,563
I was trying to help all of us. I was trying to get us rescued.

259
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,600
Claire?

260
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:54,600
Jack!

261
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:56,522
Something's wrong with Claire!

262
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:59,481
Claire?

263
00:22:01,406 --> 00:22:02,941
Grab her, grab her.

264
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,861
Let's get her up. Let's get her up.

265
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:07,160
Claire? Claire!

266
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,951
How long has she been like this?

267
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:10,411
Uh, she started feeling bad this morning.

268
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,450
Before we got back, was she showing any symptoms at all?

269
00:22:12,628 --> 00:22:13,623
No, she was fine.

270
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:16,462
- Has she been drinking enough water?
- I think so, yeah.

271
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,002
What happened to her?

272
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,341
He said, "what do you care?"

273
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:37,853
Kate! I need your help. I need you to go and get Jack.

274
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:39,980
Well, he's busy right now.

275
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:41,521
Please, I have to talk to him.

276
00:22:41,825 --> 00:22:43,820
You wanna tell me why you need Jack?

277
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,411
Because I think I know what's wrong with Claire.

278
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:50,411
Why?

279
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,791
Because I did it to her.

280
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,732
Giving you a bad feeling in your stomach?

281
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:29,533
Yeah, me, too.

282
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,370
Claire's immune system is turning on her.

283
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:35,123
She's having a latent reaction to a medication in her bloodstream.

284
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:36,163
What medication?

285
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:39,210
It was designed to keep her alive during the late stages of her pregnancy.

286
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,463
Designed by who?

287
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:43,040
By me.

288
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:46,171
For some reason the women here can't have babies.

289
00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:48,883
The mother's body turns on the pregnancy,

290
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:50,470
treats it as a foreign invader.

291
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,592
I saw it happen over and over.

292
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:55,893
Every pregnant woman on this island died...

293
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,650
that is, every pregnant woman until Claire.

294
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:04,983
What did you do to her?

295
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,202
One of our people infiltrated your camp

296
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,280
and began taking blood samples

297
00:24:13,538 --> 00:24:15,453
right after your plane crashed.

298
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,082
Ethan.

299
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,883
Even though Claire didn't conceive on this island,

300
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,540
we found that her symptoms were consistent with previous mothers,

301
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,052
- so we tried to save her life.
- By kidnapping her?

302
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,590
No, that wasn't supposed to happen.

303
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:32,931
She was our control case.

304
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,553
I had developed a serum that

305
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:38,062
I thought would reverse what was happening to her.

306
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,562
Ethan was administering the injections,

307
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:44,310
but then you found out that he wasn't on the plane.

308
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,983
The census-- I interviewed everyone.

309
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,112
One of them isn'in the manifest.

310
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,822
He wasn't on the plane.

311
00:24:50,996 --> 00:24:53,530
So... he improvised.

312
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:55,660
Hello there.

313
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:03,873
He kidnapped her on his own. That was never the plan.

314
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,920
Look, I know how this sounds,

315
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:11,800
but without those injections, Claire would have died.

316
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,893
Without the serum, she's going into a form of withdrawal, and if I don't treat her quickly,

317
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,313
her immune system could shut down entirely.

318
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,353
Jack, I can fix this. I just need the serum.

319
00:25:23,486 --> 00:25:28,522
Ethan kept a stash of medical supplies near the caves where you used to live.

320
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:32,281
If I go right now, I can be back before it's too late.

321
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:40,790
Do it.

322
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:43,212
Get moving.

323
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,631
Where are you?

324
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:56,470
In bed... with you.

325
00:26:02,526 --> 00:26:04,353
Then where were you?

326
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:06,810
I was just realizing...

327
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:11,611
that tomorrow I will have been on this island for three years.

328
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:19,493
Well... then I better bake a cake.

329
00:26:24,455 --> 00:26:25,913
Stay here.

330
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:40,801
What have you got there?

331
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,062
Karl developed some x-rays for me.

332
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:48,232
What's wrong?

333
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:56,112
Morning, Juliet.

334
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:06,713
Hi.

335
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:07,962
Can I come in?

336
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,631
Of course.

337
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:13,750
I was just finishing "Carrie."

338
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,763
I still don't know why you picked it, but, boy, is it depressing.

339
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:18,183
You have a tumor.

340
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,260
What?

341
00:27:21,476 --> 00:27:23,933
When you told me about your back pain, I said that I would

342
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,390
take some x-rays to see if it was a small fracture or a herniated disc,

343
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,023
but that's not your problem.

344
00:27:31,157 --> 00:27:34,401
Your problem is a large tumor surrounding your l4 vertebra.

345
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:48,293
You're surprised.

346
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:51,632
Well, you've just told me that I have cancer, Juliet. Of course I'm surprised.

347
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,711
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

348
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:04,723
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not scared.

349
00:28:04,978 --> 00:28:06,471
Why are you scared, Ben?

350
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:10,441
You said no one on this island ever had cancer. You told me at--

351
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:11,901
I know what I told you, Juliet.

352
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:13,653
You told me you could fix it. You said that.

353
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,611
You said that you cured my sister. You lied to me.

354
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:16,861
No, I did not lie to you.

355
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,531
If you can cure cancer, Ben, then why do you have it?

356
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:22,823
I don't know.

357
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,740
I wanna talk to her.

358
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:28,042
I wanna talk to Rachel. I wanna talk to her now!

359
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,082
That's not gonna happen, Juliet,

360
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:32,172
but I can promise you that Rachel is fine.

361
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:34,290
- You never cured her!
- I did!

362
00:28:34,428 --> 00:28:35,963
- You're a liar!
- No, Juliet--

363
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:39,131
- You lied to me!
- I told you the truth!

364
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:47,852
I gave you my word.

365
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,242
Please... I wanna go home.

366
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,780
I wanna go home, Ben. Please.

367
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,953
Can't you please just let me go home?

368
00:29:14,965 --> 00:29:15,673
No.

369
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:53,501
Step away from the case!

370
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,582
- Listen to me, Sayid--
- Step back.

371
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:04,842
It's full of medical supplies. They're for Claire. Jack knows all about it.

372
00:30:05,057 --> 00:30:06,893
Well, Jack ain't here right now, is he?

373
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,272
I'm telling you the truth.

374
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,523
You said earlier if you told me everything you knew,

375
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:17,563
I'd kill you.

376
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,071
I'm going to test the validity of that statement.

377
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:23,400
He means, "talk."

378
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,113
We don't have time for this.

379
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:27,280
We cleared our schedules.

380
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,240
We got all the time in the world.

381
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:37,713
You know, it's interesting...

382
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,132
that you two are now the camp's moral police.

383
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,670
I'm curious, Sayid.

384
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,893
How long was it before you told everyone on that beach

385
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:53,893
exactly how many people you've tortured in your life?

386
00:30:54,566 --> 00:30:57,441
Do they know about Basra?

387
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:03,440
And I'm sure the first thing you did when you got here, James,

388
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,903
was to gather everyone in a circle and tell them

389
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:11,581
about the man you shot in cold blood the night before you got on the plane.

390
00:31:11,707 --> 00:31:16,210
So why don't we just skip the part where you two pretend to be righteous?

391
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,541
I'm taking that medication back to Claire,

392
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,133
and you're gonna let me,

393
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:25,340
because if she doesn't get it,

394
00:31:25,557 --> 00:31:26,551
she's gonna die.

395
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:32,390
And the last thing that either of you need right now...

396
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:38,440
is more blood on your hands.

397
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:07,710
when you're alone and life is making you lonely you can always go

398
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:09,420
downtown

399
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:15,351
when you've got worries all the noise and the hurry seems to help, I know

400
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:17,311
downtown

401
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:21,563
just listen to the music of the traffic in the city

402
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:25,693
linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty

403
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,031
how can you lose?

404
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:33,742
The lights are much brighter there you can forget all your troubles

405
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:37,870
forget all your cares, so go downtown

406
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:41,791
things'll be great when you're downtown

407
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:58,020
Goodwin! Ethan, there may actually be survivors, and you're one of 'em--

408
00:32:58,147 --> 00:33:01,943
a passenger. You're in shock. Listen. Learn. Don't get involved.

409
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:04,312
I want lists in three days. Go.

410
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:16,160
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

411
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:22,333
Juliet.

412
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:23,922
Juliet.

413
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:28,463
I was looking for you this morning.

414
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,840
You and I need to talk.

415
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,263
- Now?
- We have some time.

416
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:35,472
It's important.

417
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:39,770
Take a walk with me.

418
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:51,741
Mikhail, we're here.

419
00:33:54,247 --> 00:33:55,782
He never has his walkie on.

420
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:58,491
- What are we doing here?
- Something I need to show you.

421
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:00,581
Mikhail?!

422
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:04,082
It's Ben! I'm here with Juliet!

423
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:07,751
We're approaching the house! Don't shoot us.

424
00:34:07,966 --> 00:34:09,671
Well, hurry up, then!

425
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:14,681
Did you see it?

426
00:34:15,308 --> 00:34:17,760
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.

427
00:34:18,018 --> 00:34:19,562
Of course we saw it.

428
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:21,933
What do you have so far?

429
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,600
Oceanic flight 815--

430
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,143
left Sydney, Australia, headed for Los Angeles,

431
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,153
324 people on board, including the flight crew.

432
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,901
I want detailed files on every single passenger.

433
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,441
Already working on it.

434
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:36,071
Can we uplink to Richard in Acadia Park, please?

435
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,290
Yesterday you called me a liar.

436
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,212
I was hurt by that.

437
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:51,383
Hello, Richard. Can you hear me?

438
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:59,761
Notice today's date. This is live. Okay, Richard.

439
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,863
Oh, my god.

440
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:22,531
Oh, my god.

441
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,120
A little over two years ago, to everyone's surprise,

442
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:29,120
Rachel's cancer went into complete remission.

443
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:35,262
Shortly after, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.

444
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:38,093
His name is Julian.

445
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,311
Okay, thank you, Richard.

446
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,601
You'll want to get back here as soon as you can.

447
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,522
We may have some new visitors.

448
00:35:53,447 --> 00:35:57,151
Oh, god! No, no! No!

449
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,202
I'm not a liar, Juliet.

450
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:09,753
- I wanna go home.
- That's not our agreement.

451
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,963
You need to stay here until your work is finished.

452
00:36:12,007 --> 00:36:15,090
It's impossible. The mothers keep dying.

453
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,591
Then we'll find more mothers.

454
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:22,093
Who knows? Maybe there's even one on that plane.

455
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:38,281
Wait. What are you doing?

456
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:41,911
She's not touching Claire. She's the one who did this to her.

457
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,872
- She can help her, Charlie.
- Says who? Her?

458
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:46,373
- How can you even trust her?
- I do trust her.

459
00:36:48,627 --> 00:36:49,750
Do you trust me?

460
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:52,792
Do you trust me?

461
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:55,882
Yeah.

462
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,670
Just give us a couple minutes here, okay?

463
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,010
How long before this takes effect?

464
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,222
We should see results in a few hours.

465
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,561
Juliet...

466
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,562
if this doesn't work,

467
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,442
if something happens to her...

468
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm not gonna be able to protect you anymore.

469
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,610
You'll be on your own.

470
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:28,790
I'm already on my own, Jack.

471
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,153
What happened?

472
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:27,180
I've got a tarp,

473
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:31,223
couple of blankets, airline pillows.

474
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,692
It's not much, but...

475
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,352
it'll get you started.

476
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,653
Claire's awake.

477
00:38:45,535 --> 00:38:48,321
There's a lean-to that we've been using for shade,

478
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:52,913
and everyone says that it'd be all right if you set up camp there for now.

479
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:54,833
Thank you.

480
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,672
They're good people,

481
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:00,422
and they're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.

482
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,553
But eventually they're gonna need some answers.

483
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,430
Why don't you?

484
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:14,020
You keep talking about them.

485
00:39:15,276 --> 00:39:18,192
Why don't I ever have to explain myself to you?

486
00:39:22,365 --> 00:39:23,571
You were there.

487
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,362
You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded...

488
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:32,622
and in that moment, I saw it in your eyes.

489
00:39:35,127 --> 00:39:37,962
You wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world.

490
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:43,920
That makes you one of us.

491
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,241
- Let's go over it again.
- I know what to do.

492
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:14,543
Let's go over it again, just to be sure.

493
00:40:15,086 --> 00:40:19,292
I drag Austen out into the jungle, handcuff myself to her,

494
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:22,881
then tell her I was gassed just like she was.

495
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:25,842
- And if she catches you in the lie?
- I'll admit to it,

496
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,513
tell her it was the only way to earn her trust.

497
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,391
Good. What then?

498
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:36,642
They'll take me back to the beach.

499
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:45,862
I know you want me to go there,

500
00:40:46,237 --> 00:40:48,571
but after everything we've done to them,

501
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:50,490
it's going to be a problem.

502
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,580
We've activated the implant in Claire.

503
00:40:57,748 --> 00:41:00,413
She should be symptomatic within the next 48 hours.

504
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:02,671
By the time you get to that camp,

505
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:06,173
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

506
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:11,762
- I'll need supplies.
- Pryce is already on his way.

507
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:14,263
He'll hide the case at Ethan's old drop point.

508
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:17,640
Tell Jack that you can save her.

509
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:20,773
He trusts you.

510
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:30,863
Are you all right?

511
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:37,451
I'm fine.

512
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:51,381
See you in a week.

513
00:42:10,035 --> 00:42:17,532
