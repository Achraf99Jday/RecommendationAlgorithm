<i>Previously on</i>
Lost...

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,254
Each one of us

3
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,036
was brought here for a reason.

4
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:06,766
And who brought us here, John?

5
00:00:06,808 --> 00:00:07,823
The island.

6
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,124
It's destiny.

7
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:11,948
<i>You and your partner will observe</i>

8
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:14,644
<i>a psychological experiment,
in progress.</i>

9
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:16,731
<i>Your duty is to observe team members</i>

10
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,368
<i>in another station on the island.</i>

11
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,152
<i>These team members are not aware
that they are under surveillance</i>

12
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:23,204
<i>or that they are the subjects
of an experiment.</i>

13
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:28,142
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

14
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:30,364
is as useless as that button!

15
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:32,783
As long as you push it,
we'll never be free.

16
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,851
If you're so sure it's not real,

17
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:37,504
then just stop pushing the button.

18
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:40,219
Well, I have, except, unfortunately,

19
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,383
someone else decided to start.

20
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:45,521
Tomorrow we're gonna find out
what happens

21
00:00:45,604 --> 00:00:48,004
if that button doesn't get pushed.

22
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,463
Who is he, Box Man...

23
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:00,400
the man out there pounding on the door?

24
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,481
His name is Mr. Eko.

25
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:06,313
Why does Mr. Eko carry around
a stick covered in scripture?

26
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:07,847
Because he's a priest.

27
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:10,717
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't!

28
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,442
It's all bloody real!
Now push the damn button!

29
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:17,522
- You've killed us all.
- No, I just saved us all.

30
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,238
<i>System failure.</i>

31
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,311
<i>System failure.</i>

32
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,713
I was wrong.

33
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:00,655
When John get back?

34
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:07,988
What's he doing?

35
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,723
Well, where's he been?
Where's everyone else?

36
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:16,557
Don't you think you should go find out?

37
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,542
So you're gone for a whole day

38
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,967
after a massive hatch detonation.

39
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:31,373
You don't call,

40
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,031
you don't write.

41
00:03:34,484 --> 00:03:36,717
Sorry. Am I interrupting something?

44
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:46,453
You're mute?

45
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:50,529
I am sorry about that.

46
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,790
So where are Eko and Desmond?

47
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:56,126
Are they off being mute
and building structures as well?

48
00:03:58,584 --> 00:03:59,974
I know. You can't speak.

49
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:02,855
You need to speak.

50
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:05,523
To me? What do you want to...

51
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:11,317
The sand. You need to speak to the sand.

52
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:16,652
Trees. Yeah, I've heard
they're wonderful conversationalists.

53
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:21,316
I don't understand.

54
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,382
Who do you need to speak to?

55
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:26,407
The... church.

56
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:28,003
Sky.

57
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,570
Island.

58
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,993
You need to speak...

59
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:41,506
to the island.

3x03 - Further Instructions

63
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:16,559
"I need your help."

64
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,984
Since when do you need my help?

65
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,336
"I need u 2 stand guard."

66
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,460
Oh, yeah, so you can talk to the island.

67
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,188
Yeah. Sounds dangerous.

68
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,939
Well, amusing
as the mute game invariably is...

69
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,245
You are aware, John,
that I detest you, aren't you?

70
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:51,535
You do remember
repeatedly punching me in the face

71
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:54,317
and accusing me of using heroin
when I was not?

72
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,390
What the sodding hell
is a "sweat lodge"?

73
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,358
Where you headed?

74
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:36,850
Eureka.

75
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,707
Well, I can get you
as far as Bridgeville.

76
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,294
Come on, hop in. Come on.

77
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:56,851
- My name's John.
- Eddie.

78
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,560
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

79
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,723
- Nasty day to be hitching.
- That's for sure.

80
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:06,334
If you don't mind my asking,
what's in Eureka?

81
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,316
I heard there was some work there,
cutting timber.

82
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,306
Is that what you do?

83
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:13,150
That might be what I do. I don't know.

84
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:15,713
All I know is that I had to get out
of where I came from.

85
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,826
Mom's dead, dad's a drunk.

86
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:26,500
Hey, look at that. The rain is passing.

87
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,733
What, did you rob a bank?

88
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,287
'Fraid so.

89
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,848
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

90
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:47,625
Was I speeding, officer?

91
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:48,702
Tail light's out.

92
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,739
Could you both please
step out of the vehicle?

93
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:02,061
What do you got back here?

94
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,066
Guns and groceries.

95
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,449
Now the transaction logs
and the paperwork

96
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,546
for all of 'em's in the red notebook
right there in that duffel.

97
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,848
So are we free to go?

98
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,400
I could still take you in
for picking up a hitchhiker.

99
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:33,058
Oh, that's my uncle.

100
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:37,086
I called him, and he picked me up.

101
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,120
Get outta here.

102
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,856
So what is with all the guns...

103
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:02,909
uncle?

104
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:08,654
I like the indoor fireplace.

105
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:10,956
It's very snazzy.

106
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,931
What's that?

107
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,560
You're not...
taking drugs, are you, John?

108
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:24,384
I only ask because of the strict
zero-tolerance policy you've enacted.

109
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:28,121
I wouldn't want you to have
to start punching yourself in the face.

110
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,337
Yeah, I know. I get it. You're gonna go
in your little magic hut,

111
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,280
and I'm gonna stand out here
in case you devolve into a monkey.

112
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:44,451
"Don't... come in."

113
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,216
Okay. I get it.

114
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:44,187
Hi, John.

115
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,720
It's good to see you again.

116
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,153
What's that, John?

117
00:10:58,423 --> 00:10:59,461
You're sorry.

118
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:01,472
That's okay.

119
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,938
I was the sacrifice the island demanded.

120
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,601
Don't worry.

121
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:14,234
You'll speak
when you have something worth saying.

122
00:11:15,014 --> 00:11:17,234
I'm here
to help you find your way again,

123
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:19,889
so you can bring
the family back together.

124
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:23,755
Come on.

125
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,034
I want to show you something.

126
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,826
You're gonna need that.

127
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,730
John, someone in this airport
is in serious danger.

128
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,552
You are the only one who can save them.

129
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,268
Not them. They'll be fine...

130
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:11,718
for a while.

131
00:12:20,307 --> 00:12:21,654
I think Sayid's got it.

132
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:24,058
Next, please.

133
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:35,673
Not Hurley.

134
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,360
Forget it. He's helping himself.

135
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:15,678
There's nothing you can do for them,
not yet.

136
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:18,320
First,
you have to clean up your own mess.

137
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:20,651
<i>Clean up your own mess...</i>

138
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,633
<i>first,
you have to clean up your own mess.</i>

139
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:40,829
Come up here, John.

140
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,225
<i>Clean it up, John.</i>

141
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,063
They've got him.

142
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,726
You don't have much time.

143
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:20,631
What happened?

144
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:23,726
Are you all right?

145
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,637
What are you doing?

146
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:47,365
I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life.

147
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,464
Eko's cross.

148
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,956
He was dragged this way.

149
00:15:15,495 --> 00:15:16,551
Dragged?

150
00:15:17,547 --> 00:15:18,541
By what?

151
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:19,660
By the polar bear.

152
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,628
Sawyer killed the polar bear.

153
00:15:23,664 --> 00:15:25,198
He killed a polar bear.

154
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,599
What's that, John, blood?

155
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,405
I'm gonna go on alone, Charlie.
You go back to Claire.

156
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,733
Well, I'll take my chances.

157
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,536
You don't want to go with me, Charlie.

158
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,783
Bad things happen to people
who hang around with me.

159
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:19,442
Hey, Bobby.

160
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,133
What's that?

161
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:46,055
That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge.

162
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:47,689
A what?

163
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,736
Anybody who wants
can go in there and light a fire

164
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:53,349
and get it nice and hot and meditate.

165
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:54,531
Then what?

166
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:57,261
And then you're supposed
to find what to do with your life,

167
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,392
you know, what-- what direction to take.

168
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,995
Go on in there and figure out
if you're a farmer or a hunter.

169
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,273
So which are you, John?

170
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,339
Hey, John.

171
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,402
Hey, Mike. Jan, this is Eddie.

172
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,203
He's looking for some logging work,

173
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,854
but I convinced him to come home
and have supper with us first.

174
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:21,823
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- Nice to meet you.

175
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:24,310
Any friend of John's
is a friend of ours.

176
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,030
Right. John's a very special guy.

177
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:28,693
Grab a spot.

178
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,378
So you like Geronimo Jackson, huh?

179
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,728
Yeah, yeah. They're all right.

180
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,412
It's one of my dad's old shirts.

181
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:37,967
Your dad has excellent taste.

182
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:40,783
Listen up, people.

183
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,314
John brought a guest to supper.

184
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,489
So, everyone, this is Eddie.

185
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,555
- Hi, Eddie.
- Eddie, this is everyone.

186
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,773
Nice to meet you.

187
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,638
John, you want to say some grace?

188
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:55,778
Yeah.

189
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:01,838
Thank you, Lord.

190
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,196
Thank you for the food and the friends,

191
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,101
and thanks for the rain today,

192
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:11,188
so that Adam will stop
grumbling about the drought.

193
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:16,594
And for me, thank you
for helping me stop being so angry,

194
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,957
And... and for...

195
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,988
helping me find a real family.

196
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,978
Because they're a hell of a lot better

197
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,144
than the one I used to have,
so let's eat. Amen.

198
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:32,919
Let's dig in.

199
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,598
Potatoes?

200
00:18:36,141 --> 00:18:38,152
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:19:04,838 --> 00:19:06,144
Is that the hatch?

202
00:19:06,268 --> 00:19:07,636
What's left of it.

203
00:19:08,468 --> 00:19:09,544
What happened?

204
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:12,767
Looks like it...

205
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:13,988
imploded.

206
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,227
What is that?

207
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:53,927
It's an active kill.

208
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:57,569
Meaning that whatever
was eating this is coming back for more.

209
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:59,953
If you want to say polar bear,
you can just say it.

210
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,902
All right. Polar bear.

211
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,262
Run!

212
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,173
Dude.

213
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,097
They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer,

214
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:58,727
And they sent me back
to tell everyone else

215
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,717
that we can't ever go over there.

216
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,188
Oh, and that dude
we had in the hatch--

217
00:21:04,354 --> 00:21:05,369
Henry?

218
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:08,126
He was there. He's, like, their leader.

219
00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:15,675
So... what do we do?

220
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,326
Do what they told you.
Go back to the camp and tell the others.

221
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:21,797
You're not gonna do anything?

222
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,647
I am doing something.
Go back to the beach, Hugo.

223
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:27,468
Wait. Where are you guys going?

224
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,397
The island told Locke
he has to save Eko.

225
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,865
Save him from what?

226
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,659
Well, apparently a bear's got him.

227
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:36,980
It's just made an active kill.

228
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:39,176
You may want to hustle.

229
00:21:43,796 --> 00:21:44,867
Bear?

230
00:21:49,526 --> 00:21:50,645
What bear?

231
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,648
What's that, more fur?

232
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:06,462
This way.

233
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,427
When I used to get high,

234
00:22:15,556 --> 00:22:17,753
I'd watch nature programs on the "beeb."

235
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,934
Polar bears
are meant to be quite clever.

236
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,313
Very clever.

237
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,000
They're like the Einsteins

238
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:27,203
of the bear community.

239
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,595
She likes you, man.

240
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:57,134
Oh, yeah, she does.

241
00:22:57,196 --> 00:22:58,730
- She does not.
- Yeah, she does.

242
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,320
She's like half my age, man.
You'd be better off with her.

243
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,684
No. Lizzie's too granola for me.

244
00:23:04,277 --> 00:23:06,453
What she really wants is a daddy.

245
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,088
Like everyone else here.

246
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,539
You should take advantage of that.

247
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,052
That's not real funny, Eddie.

248
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:15,035
It was a joke.

249
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,283
It was a joke! I'm sorry.

250
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:23,939
How come you never talk
about your dad, John?

251
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,099
Nothing worth talking about.

252
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,525
What's going on
in that greenhouse over there?

253
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,469
Maybe they need a hand
with that fertilizer.

254
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:40,438
No, no, they're okay. They're okay.

255
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:42,257
Come on. We got orchard duty.

256
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:52,112
What's the big secret, John?

257
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:54,646
Sorry?

258
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:58,000
The greenhouse. What do you guys
got in there? What are you hiding?

259
00:23:58,147 --> 00:24:01,318
'Cause every time I go near it,
you and everyone else acts all weird.

260
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,743
Look, you're a guest here.
These things take time.

261
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:05,979
I've been here for six weeks.

262
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,072
- Eddie, nothing's--
- I'm not blind, man.

263
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,600
Did you forget that you had
a duffel bag full of guns

264
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:12,756
- When you brought me here?
- Mike and Jan

265
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:15,522
welcomed you here with open arms.
They feed you.

266
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:18,445
- They give you a place to stay...
- And Mike and Jan

267
00:24:18,548 --> 00:24:20,911
fold their hands every night before chow

268
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,354
and talk about how we're family,

269
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:25,007
but your family's got too many secrets.

270
00:24:25,753 --> 00:24:28,752
Now I see the fertilizer
going into that greenhouse.

271
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:30,720
I know what's going on...

272
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:33,258
and I want in.

273
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,677
In on what?

274
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,368
Whatever you guys are trying to blow up.

275
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,013
What's so funny?

276
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:48,853
Nothing.

277
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,407
I'll talk to Mike and Jan.

278
00:25:01,926 --> 00:25:03,792
You really think Eko's in there?

279
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:09,534
Let's hurry up and do this.

280
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,420
Maybe the bear's out
finishing his lunch.

281
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,780
- You're not going in there, Charlie.
- What?

282
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:16,068
I'm gonna do this alone.

283
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:18,695
You don't tell me
what I can't do.

284
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,233
If I want to,
I'll go in there.

285
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,263
- Why?
- What?

286
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:23,029
Why do you want to go in there?

287
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:24,438
I don't need a reason.

288
00:25:24,894 --> 00:25:26,506
- Then go back.
- Go back?

289
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,814
You don't have a good reason
to go in there, either.

290
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:31,761
I'm going in there because
I'm supposed to go in there.

291
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,653
If it all goes to plan,

292
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,823
we probably won't even see
the bear, will we?

293
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,709
Hopefully he won't smell us.

294
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:47,431
Hair spray? Now I hate to be the one

295
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,776
- to point this out to you--
- It's not for me.

296
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:40,601
Bear?

297
00:26:42,454 --> 00:26:43,739
Is that you?

298
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,041
Who's there?

299
00:26:47,688 --> 00:26:49,035
Are you alone, brother?

300
00:26:50,447 --> 00:26:51,484
Yeah.

301
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,900
Dude. I'm not alone.

302
00:26:58,177 --> 00:26:59,752
The beach camp's right over there.

303
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:01,141
Can you get me some clothes?

304
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:03,337
What happened to yours?

305
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,466
I woke up in the jungle like this.

306
00:27:10,036 --> 00:27:11,052
So...

307
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,373
like, the hatch...

308
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:17,161
blew off your underwear?

309
00:27:19,027 --> 00:27:22,215
Fine. You wanna discuss this
in great detail right now, let's do it.

310
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:24,581
No, no, that's okay.
I got something in here.

311
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,554
How do you feel about tie-dye?

312
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:30,733
Hey, Kim.

313
00:28:31,697 --> 00:28:33,024
Hey, Mike and Jan in?

314
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,716
Yeah. They were looking for you.

315
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:39,767
Good, good. Good timing, then, huh?

316
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:43,385
Go on in.

317
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:48,160
- You got all the cash?
- In the bag.

318
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:50,233
- Which bag?
- The one with the money in it!

319
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:52,035
- What about the bank records?
- Leave 'em.

320
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,784
Shouldn't we sort out
what they can trace?

321
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,297
There is no time, Mike.

322
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:57,152
What's going on?

323
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:58,893
What does it look like?

324
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:00,693
I don't...

325
00:29:01,694 --> 00:29:03,870
you screwed up, John.
You blew it big time.

326
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,358
What are you--
what...

327
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,706
What are you doing?

328
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:12,636
Are you leaving?

329
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:15,393
- Why?
- That is why, you idiot!

330
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:17,136
John, your friend's a cop.

331
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:19,540
You know how much jail time
we'd get for this much weed?

332
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:22,527
Nice picture, huh?
Got him fresh out of the academy.

333
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:24,288
No, he was--
He was hitchhiking.

334
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,839
He told me he was going to Eureka.

335
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,538
He was waiting for you, John.

336
00:29:27,663 --> 00:29:30,248
He has been here
for six weeks gathering evidence

337
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,729
because you brought him here.

338
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,286
- No, Mike, that's impossible.
- He played you for a sucker.

339
00:29:34,361 --> 00:29:35,481
Now it's over.

340
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,627
No. Wait.

341
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,632
Wait. No, wait, wait. Stop!

342
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:45,119
We don't know what he's told 'em.

343
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:46,786
He hasn't even been in here yet.

344
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:49,211
If he's still gathering evidence
and trying to make a case,

345
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:51,259
- then it's not too late.
- Not too late for what?

346
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:53,293
To protect us. To protect all of us.

347
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,028
It's not too late to fix this.

348
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:56,893
I can fix this.

349
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:01,222
How are you gonna do that, John?

350
00:31:17,485 --> 00:31:18,696
Is he okay?

351
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,106
He alive?

352
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:22,127
- Is he all right?
- He's alive.

353
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,055
Turn him over, turn him over.

354
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,203
Charlie, we gotta get outta here.

355
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,999
Okay. Let's get him up.

356
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:35,300
So, when you say "turned a key,"

357
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:37,136
you mean, like, a key key?

358
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,074
It was a failsafe key.

359
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:41,208
That seems kinda convenient.

360
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,446
I'm sorry?

361
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:46,722
I'm just saying, if you had
this magic key the whole time,

362
00:31:46,763 --> 00:31:48,348
why didn't you, like, use it?

363
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:50,016
I didn't know what would happen.

364
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,384
So what did happen?

365
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,401
Well, the failsafe key
must have detonated

366
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:56,534
the electromagnetic anomaly,
made the hatch implode.

367
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,917
But you didn't implode.

368
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:06,199
You're not gonna, like,
turn into the Hulk or something?

369
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,995
So is that what made the blender noise

370
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,475
and the sky turn purple?

371
00:32:12,578 --> 00:32:14,267
Afraid I missed that, brother.

372
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,176
Right. You were failsafing.
Well, F.Y.I.,

373
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,497
the whole island vibrated,

374
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,700
and Kate and Jack
and Sawyer saw it, too,

375
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,828
right before they had bags
pulled over their heads--

376
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,988
Don't worry.

377
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:27,040
Locke's gonna go after them.

378
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:29,473
- He said so in his speech.
- What?

379
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:33,071
What speech?

380
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:36,332
All he said was
he was gonna save Eko and kill bears.

381
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:39,905
Right.

382
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:42,174
Right, of course.

383
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:44,987
I'm sorry. I...

384
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:48,565
I'm just, uh, a bit shook up.

385
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:02,968
I burned that bear pretty good.

386
00:33:03,168 --> 00:33:05,240
I don't think
he's gonna be coming after us.

387
00:33:05,939 --> 00:33:08,666
Now that we've survived
this suicide mission,

388
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:11,173
do you wanna tell me what you saw?

389
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:12,745
What I saw?

390
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:14,868
In your spirit tent.

391
00:33:16,755 --> 00:33:17,978
I saw Boone.

392
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:21,634
Boone?

393
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,450
What did he have to say for himself?

394
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,028
He told me I had
to clean up my own mess.

395
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:31,092
Well, dead as he may be,

396
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:32,921
I agree with Boone.

397
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:35,941
After all, if you kept pressing
that button like Eko told you to--

398
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,397
We wouldn't have had
to save him in the first place,

399
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:41,539
yeah, charlie, that's what cleaning up
your own mess means.

400
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:47,190
Spoken like someone who's had
a few too many messes to clean.

401
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:00,762
No deer, huh?

402
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,449
You talk to Mike and Jan yet?

403
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:08,804
Yeah, sure did.

404
00:34:09,334 --> 00:34:10,681
Yeah? What'd they say?

405
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:14,690
They said that I should bring you
by the greenhouse

406
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:17,831
tonight after supper
and that they would explain everything.

407
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,124
Cool.

408
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,390
That's great.

409
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:26,123
What, did you see something?

410
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,851
What are you doing?

411
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,882
Did you know it would be me?

412
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,506
- What?
- In the truck.

413
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:46,889
Did you know it would be me driving?

414
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:49,501
Did they choose me?

415
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,200
They? John, I have no idea
what you're talking about--

416
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:54,639
I didn't load that one.

417
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,567
So how about you just
answer the question, Eddie?

418
00:35:04,511 --> 00:35:05,588
Yeah.

419
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,209
They chose you, John.

420
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:12,483
Why?

421
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,054
Because you hadn't been here long,

422
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,567
didn't have a criminal record,
and the psych profile said

423
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:19,777
you would be amenable for coercion.

424
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,868
Amenable for coercion--

425
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:26,997
Lower the gun, John.

426
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:30,795
Okay? This isn't personal.

427
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:32,433
It's not personal?!

428
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:40,543
Stop, stop.

429
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,934
I'm sorry, John,
but you're not gonna shoot me.

430
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:44,890
You're not a murderer.

431
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,440
You're a good man.

432
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,486
You're a farmer.

433
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,670
I'm not a farmer.

434
00:35:56,561 --> 00:35:57,825
I was a hunter.

435
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,519
I'm a hunter.

436
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:04,462
I'm gonna walk away now, John.

437
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,203
Hey, John. You hear something?

438
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,801
- It sounds like a stream.
- Yeah.

439
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,840
Let's put him down.
Maybe if we get some water in him.

440
00:36:54,824 --> 00:36:56,938
I'll go. You stay here.

441
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:16,933
I'm sorry.

442
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:20,532
Sorry I ever doubted you.

443
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,415
Sorry I gave up
on my faith in the island.

444
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:31,761
I messed up.

445
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,716
Now our people are captured and...

446
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:39,297
if I'd just listened to you,

447
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,955
if I'd just let you...

448
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:43,561
keep pushing the button...

449
00:37:45,855 --> 00:37:47,326
I could've gone with them,

450
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:49,842
protected them.

451
00:37:51,558 --> 00:37:53,033
I could've saved 'em.

452
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,871
You can still protect them...

453
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,710
you can still save them.

454
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,332
I don't even know where they are.

455
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,031
You will find them.

456
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,736
After all...

457
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,324
you are a hunter, John.

458
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,180
- You say something?
- He's awake.

459
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,732
Maybe we should just...

460
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:56,649
get him back.

461
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,767
- You all right?
- Yeah. Just keep walking.

462
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:11,770
What happened?

463
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:12,931
We got him.

464
00:39:13,275 --> 00:39:15,203
- Is he alive?
- We need Jack.

465
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,300
- Take him in.
- Jack's not coming back.

466
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,445
- They've got him.
- What?

467
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:21,751
What are you talking about?

468
00:39:21,807 --> 00:39:23,838
- Jack's gone?
- I don't understand.

469
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:26,458
Okay, when were you planning
on telling us, Hurley?

470
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,126
What do you mean, "they"? Who's "they"?

471
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:29,380
"They"

472
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,245
are the others,

473
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,986
and yes, they've taken Jack...

474
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:35,100
and Kate and Sawyer.

475
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:37,023
How? What happened?

476
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,235
What about Sun and Jin and Sayid?

477
00:39:39,297 --> 00:39:41,100
- Are they okay?
- I don't know.

478
00:39:42,676 --> 00:39:44,272
I'm gonna find our friends.

479
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:48,983
I don't know how yet, but I will.

480
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,020
We're gonna find them--
all of them.

481
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,989
And then we're gonna bring them home.

482
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:58,277
But first things first.
We've gotta look after Mr. Eko,

483
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:00,744
so, Paulo, Nikki,
bring towels and water.

484
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,366
Claire, we gotta clean him up,

485
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:04,905
so bring all the first aid supplies you.

486
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:16,759
Not a bad speech.

487
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:23,745
"Whoa," what?

488
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:28,398
Just got hit with, you know...

489
00:40:33,528 --> 00:40:34,937
déjà vu.

490
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:41,651
Well, when that wears off,

491
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:45,050
can you get, bandadges,
from the kitchen?
