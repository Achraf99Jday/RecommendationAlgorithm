1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,878
<i>And now, dancing on stage three,</i>

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,714
<i>the pride of St. Paul, Corvette!</i>

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,070
No! That's the money for the orphanage!

4
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,152
That means, Mr. LaShade,
you're The Cobra.

5
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,234
Sorry, baby. It's just business.

6
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,676
- All this time, it was you.
- Pretty and smart.

7
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,193
What a shame.

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,798
Razzle Dazzle!

9
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,313
Autumn, Crystal, bad news.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,119
Corvette was working for the Cobra.

11
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,831
But fear not, he will pay.

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,078
And, cut!

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,436
- Check the gate.
- Checking.

14
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,909
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,230
Billy Dee, it was so great
working with you.

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,992
The pleasure was all mine.

17
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,479
- You're sweet.
- Take care.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,913
You too.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,719
All right, that's a series wrap
for Corvette!

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,800
- Let's hear it for Nikki!
- Well done, lass.

21
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,438
- Well done, Nikki.
- Thank you.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,919
- On ya, Nikki!
- Thanks.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,831
Brilliant, Nikki, as always.

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,352
You know, you don't need to die.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,238
- We can bring you back next season.
- How?

26
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,029
Well, we could say that Corvette
was wearing a bulletproof vest.

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,912
Bulletproof breast?

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,229
Look, I'm just a guest star.
We all know what happens to guest stars.

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,151
Now that your work's done here,

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,437
I suppose you'll be leaving Sydney
and heading back to L. A?

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,795
No, I'm not leaving Sydney.

32
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,233
I love you.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,752
I love you, too.

34
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,756
Son of a bitch!
All right, come on, let's go, one more.

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,355
- You said best out of five.
- Well, now we're going best of seven.

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,712
Are you OK?

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,110
- What happened?
- Pa... lyz...

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,916
- What'd the hell she say?
- I don't know.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,150
Let's get her some water!
Get help!

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,350
What are you doing?
Get moving!

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,679
Dude...

44
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,356
Howie, the frittata is amazing.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,193
It's my new chef.
He's fantastic.

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,113
- Paulo, come in here.
- Yes, sir?

47
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,839
Paulo, my boy, you have a new fan.

48
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,832
- I'd like you to meet Nikki.
- The food is amazing.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,751
You're too kind.

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,593
The secret is the shaved truffles.

51
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,188
- Luckily for you they're in season.
- You know, you should ask for a raise.

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,438
Excuse me.

53
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,080
He just came to Sydney.
Heard I was hiring

54
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,311
and showed up at my office every day
until I gave him the job.

55
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,913
Apparently, back home,

56
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,956
- he's the Wolfgang Puck of Brazil.
- Wow.

57
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,116
Here. Try one of these homemade rolls.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,997
Please. Please, do.

59
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,111
Oh, it's beautiful.
Howie, you shouldn't have.

60
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,673
I realize, of course, it's not a ring.
Not yet.

61
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,238
But when my wife...

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,470
Paulo. Paulo!

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,358
He is gone.

64
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,714
I would have loved if you could have
figured out a way

65
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,155
where I didn't have to eat
the same food as him.

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,310
Nobody else knows about this thing?

67
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,675
Everything in here is way off the books.

68
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,476
- What?
- Ashes are evidence, Paulo.

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,358
We poisoned him.
Let's not poison ourselves.

70
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,070
Razzle frickin' dazzle.

71
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,716
- What happened?
- We don't know.

72
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,989
She's got no gunshot wound, knife wound,
no polar bear bite, nothing.

73
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,117
- Maybe it was something she ate.
- Maybe she was poisoned.

74
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,998
We should check the food
to see if anyone else is sick.

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,799
She's got gunk under her fingernails.

76
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,550
- Where did you find her?
- Right here.

77
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,949
She stumbled out of the jungle,
face planted,

78
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,079
<i>said something like "plywood",
and then, sayonara.</i>

79
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,276
Actually, I think
she said "power lines".

80
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,557
Who the hell knows what she said?
She was five seconds from dying.

81
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,871
- Seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
- "Paulo lies. "

82
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,633
That's what she said, not "power lines".
"Paulo lies. "

83
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,235
- Who the hell's Paulo?
- Paulo's her... husband.

84
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,754
Or her boyfriend. Or whatever.

85
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,274
- They live down the beach.
- Where the hell is he?

86
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,158
'Cause if he lies,
that might be a good place to start.

87
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,834
"English expat Howard L. Zuckerman,

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,114
Are you chewing gum?

92
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,513
Nicotine gum.

93
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,672
I quit.

94
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,319
A toast.
To our new life together.

95
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,913
Cheers.

96
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,396
There's nowhere to sit.

97
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,278
No tables, no chairs, nothing.

98
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,475
Good call, Boone.

99
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,396
- You want a chair from the restaurant?
- Forget it. Let's leave.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,314
You screwed up seats in first class.
Why would you be able to find them here?

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,789
- Can I have this chair, please?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,550
- Be my guest.
- Boone, let's just go!

103
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,189
- Thanks, anyway.
- Boone!

104
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,554
I'm coming, Shannon.

105
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,757
If you quit flirting with random guys
maybe we could get on the plane.

106
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,149
Promise me we'll never end up like them.

107
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,639
I promise.

108

Boone!

Boone!

Help me!

113
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,476
Hey, hey!
Get away from there!

114
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,312
Hey, get back! Get down!

115
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,879
Get away from there!

116
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,113
Paulo!

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,428
Are we alive?

118
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,239
Did we survive?
Look at me. Am I OK?

119
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,673
Am I OK?

120
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,512
Hey, do you have a pen?

121
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,556
- Do you have a pen?
- A pen?

122
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,835
Hey, does anybody have a pen?

123
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,189
Paulo? Paulo!

124
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,555
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,116
- I think so.
- Baby, look at me.

126
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,349
Look at me.

127
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,836
- Where's the bag?
- What?

128
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,990
The bag! Paulo, where is it?

129
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,437
I'm telling you, this is the trail.

130
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,671
- What do you know about tracking?
- I know what a footprint is.

131
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,193
Over here.

132
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,438
Whoa.

133
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,312
I'm guessing that's Paulo.

134
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,116
He's just like Nikki.
No wound, nothing.

135
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,310
Yeah, I know.
Why are his pants undone?

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,990
- And why is his shoe in that tree?
- Maybe he stepped on something.

137
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,028
You see something?

138
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,599
Sawyer?

139
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,633
Nothing.

140
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,199
No!

141
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,959
Don't.

142
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,113
Dude, what are you doing?

143
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,430
You ever think
they might have been poisoned?

144
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,592
That's evidence.
You're messing up the crime scene.

145
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,159
"Crime scene?"

146
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,754
- Is there a forensics hatch?
- Stop!

147
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,835
Monster.

148
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,829
How many times do I have to tell you,
there's no such thing as monsters.

149
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,392
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

150
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,438
It's not Jurassic Park, Paulo.
It's the South Pacific.

151
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,909
Then what was it?
You saw the trees move.

152
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,471
Would you start focusing?

153
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:17,109
We've been here for six days.
The Coast Guard will be here any second.

154
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,034
And I don't think they're gonna take,
"I'm looking for my script bag"

155
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,793
as an excuse
for not getting on the rescue boat.

156
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,519
Hey! Did you guys lose your luggage?

157
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,559
Yeah, I lost mine, too.

158
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,392
I found some other stuff, though.

159
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,278
So if you need anything...
pants, or a sweatshirt...

160
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,430
...I can help you find some that fit.

161
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,192
I'm Ethan, by the way.

162
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,272
Hi, I'm Nikki
and this is Paulo.

163
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
- Hi.
- And you're so sweet, Ethan.

164
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,798
But, actually,
we're not looking for clothes.

165
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,633
Yeah, see, Paulo here
lost his nicotine gum.

166
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,317
- You might have luck looking inland.
- In the jungle?

167
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,391
The plane split apart over the island,

168
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,392
so some of the stuff
might have rained down in there.

169
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,914
Boone! Boone took the water.

170
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,514
- No one would have understood.
- What is going on?

171
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,797
Someone had to take responsibility.
40 would have never lasted!

172
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,438
Leave him alone!

173
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,878
It's been six days.

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,154
We're all still waiting
for someone to come.

175
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,398
We have to stop waiting.

176
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,556
We need to start figuring things out.

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,473
Now, I found water, fresh water,
up in the valley.

178
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,996
I'll take in a group at first light.

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,950
If you don't want to come,
then find another way to contribute.

180
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,277
Because every man for himself
is not gonna work.

181
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,555
But if we can't live together,

182
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,597
we're gonna die alone.

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,275
I'm with Jin. It's the monster.

184
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,318
- Because that makes the most sense.
- It does.

185
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,710
Locke said when Eko died,
his last words were "you're next".

186
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,711
And Nikki and Paulo were with them.

187
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,113
He was talking about them.

188
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,873
He wasn't saying "you're next"
about them.

189
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,270
He was sayin' "you're next"
as in, you're all next.

190
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,510
Yeah, that's not really better.

191
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,353
All right.
So here's how I see it.

192
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,953
We want to know what happened,

193
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,873
we gotta find out whatever we can
about these jabonies.

194
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,190
- "Jabonies?"
- Nina and Pablo.

195
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,679
Dude, show some respect.

196
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,990
You know their names.
It's Nikki and Paulo.

197
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,034
Whatever, Hugo.
Where's their tent?

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,150
And we better get some shovels.

199
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,633
Hey, Dr. Arzt.

200
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,429
Hi.

201
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,033
You're a scientist, right?

202
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,796
And an educator, yes.

203
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,075
What are you doing with all this stuff?

204
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,390
Since we got here
I discovered 20 new species.

205
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,152
I'll be the next Charles Darwin.

206
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,920
<i>That is Latrodectus regina.</i>

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,991
Very dangerous.

208
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,755
They call her the Medusa spider.
Her pheromones are very strong.

209
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,515
One whiff and every male of the species
would be here in seconds.

210
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,830
Not unlike you, I guess.

211
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,679
So, you're probably too busy
to help me, then?

212
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,752
No, no, not at all. I'm fine.

213
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,398
I can help.
What can I do you for?

214
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,710
Well, I'm trying to find my luggage,

215
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,917
and since the plane broke apart
over the jungle,

216
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,709
I was wondering if you knew about
trajectories and stuff?

217
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,638
Do I know about trajectories?

218
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,669
Allow me to draw you a map, Madame.

219
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,598
Are you sure we should listen
to a high school teacher?

220
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,910
Junior high, and yes.

221
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,909
What's your problem with Leslie, anyway?

222
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,958
- Leslie?
- You're jealous.

223
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,996
Of him? Never.

224
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,358
Yeah, his spiders turn me on so much
I had to sleep with him to get the map.

225
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,193
I wouldn't be surprised.
You slept with Zuckerman.

226
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,319
I did that for us.

227
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,792
OK. I'm sorry, I just...

228
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,791
I don't trust that guy.

229
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,440
We should have gone to Ethan.
He would have helped.

230
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,873
Paulo, look.

231
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,919
Another plane.

232
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,350
- It's been here awhile.
- Go up there.

233
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,908
- Maybe there's a radio.
- Are you insane?

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,798
If I go up there
that thing's gonna fall.

235
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,075
- You're not gonna fall.
- What?

236
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,878
You want me to die?

237
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,110
Come on. Let's keep going.

238
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,713
What is that?

239
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,353
OK, let's do it.

240
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,070
- Let's check it out.
- Whoa.

241
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,478
So, our carry-on bag
fell from the sky,

242
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,109
opened a manhole, crawled inside
and closed the doors behind itself?

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,159
You don't want to climb up to a plane,
but now you want to climb down a ladder

244
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,878
into a dark tunnel.

245
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,033
I don't think so.

246
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,359
Hey, man, be careful.

247
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,996
Why? They don't live here anymore.

248
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,877
So, Sun checked the food.

249
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,599
They're eating the same as us
and no one else is sick.

250
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,790
- Could be a virus.
- Dude.

251
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,077
Monster.

252
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,035
Creepy. They collected bugs?

253
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,236
I think these were Arzt's.

254
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,551
He collected all kinds
of creepy crawlies before he...

255
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,354
...exploded.

256
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,271
They must have been friends.

257
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,839
<i>"Exposé. "</i>

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,675
<i>- Did you just say Exposé?
- Yeah.</i>

259
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,113
<i>What the hell is Exposé?</i>

260
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,714
Only the most awesome hour
of television ever.

261
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,870
<i>It's like Baywatch, only better.</i>

262
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,552
It's about Autumn and Crystal,

263
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,312
two strippers that solve crimes

264
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,109
with the help of their suave,
smooth-talking club owner, Mr. LaShade.

265
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,952
- How'd I miss that?
- Check it out.

266
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,190
Look at the cast list.
Nikki Fernandez.

267
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,430
That's gotta be
why she was in Australia.

268
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,796
- This must have been her big break.
- Certainly sounds like it.

269
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,995
No way.

270
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,838
Mr. LaShade was The Cobra?

271
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,911
Is that supposed to mean something?

272
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,150
Dude, the Cobra's this big bad guy.

273
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,471
His identity's been shrouded in mystery
for four seasons.

274
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,358
They had a walkie-talkie?

275
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,238
Every one of those bastards
on the other side of the island

276
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,356
had one like this
hanging from their belts.

277
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,351
So how did Nikki and Paulo get one?

278
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,434
I'll tell you how.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,275
They were working with The Others.

280
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,150
- What gives you the right?
- We thought it was best for everybody.

281
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,800
Are you my mother?
She knows what's best for me.

282
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,394
- Other than that, I decide.
- What's going on?

283
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,396
Kate and her two boyfriends
found a case of guns from the plane.

284
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,152
They decided not to tell the camp.

285
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,639
The case is locked.

286
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,439
The key is around Jack's neck.
I promise they're safe.

287
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,953
You're all out of control.

288
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,835
The pigs are walking.
The pigs are walking!

289
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,355
So, where did you say
you found that case?

290
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,191
It's just water, Paulo.

291
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,556
- Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
- Why me?

292
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,313
Well, as you had no trouble
reminding me,

293
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,038
I slept with Howie Zuckerman.

294
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,874
The least you could do is go for a swim.
They found the case on the bottom.

295
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,871
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

296
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,191
If you didn't need me to find that bag
would we still be together?

297
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,396
That bag is worth eight million dollars.

298
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,995
Just dive in, Paulo.

299
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,834
Well?

300
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,753
- Nothing.
- There's nothing down there?

301
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,392
Just dead bodies.

302
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,358
OK, so they had a walkie-talkie.

303
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,954
You think they were working
with The Others? How?

304
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,359
Like Michael.

305
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,398
If that's the case, then why
did they kill Nikki and Paulo?

306
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,516
Who knows why
those people do anything?

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,797
What matters is, they could be
out there now, waiting to get us.

308
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,279
I don't know, dude.

309
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,955
I was with The Others two weeks ago.
They're on the other side of the island.

310
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,349
Then who dragged me into the jungle?

311
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,118
The Others came into our camp.

312
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,668
They grabbed me, put a bag over my head.

313
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,638
And if I hadn't gotten away,
they would have killed me.

314
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,869
Look, y'all stay here. Let me see
if I can see any sign of them.

315
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,633
- I'll do a perimeter sweep.
- Where'd you get the gun?

316
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,553
- Got it off one of them.
- When were you gonna let us know?

317
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,277
I guess right now.

318
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,957
What, exactly, is a perimeter sweep?

319
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,152
Shouldn't we cover them up?

320
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,514
Yes, of course.

321
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,558
Nice night.

322
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,156
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

323
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,274
It looks like you're digging a hole.

324
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,839
Every man's entitled to his secrets,
but can I give you a piece of advice?

325
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,035
Please, John.

326
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,395
Put the shovel away
and save yourself trouble.

327
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,799
Why is that?

328
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,070
Things don't stay buried on this island.

329
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,398
The beach is eroding.

330
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,311
Winter's coming. High tide.

331
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,995
Whatever it is you're hiding,
pick a spot that won't wash away.

332
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,793
See you back at camp.

333
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,513
Who left this open?

334
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,636
Tom was down here a couple of days ago.

335
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,438
Have him cover it up with a plank.

336
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,790
Is that him? Shephard?

337
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,029
Yes.

338
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,633
He's cute.

339
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,473
Why are we doing this?

340
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,074
Shephard will never agree
to do the surgery.

341
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,879
- No, I can convince him to do it.
- How?

342
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,599
The same way
I get anybody to do anything.

343
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,594
I find out what he's
emotionally invested in,

344
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,194
and I exploit it.

345
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,833
So, what?

346
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,753
So, we just grab all three of them?
Ford and Austen too?

347
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,832
- No. They need to come to us.
- How do we make that happen?

348
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,353
Michael, of course.

349
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,354
Are we done here?

350
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,271
This place gives me the creeps.

351
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,191
Hey, Desmond.

352
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,517
You hear about Nikki and Paulo?

353
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,999
Aye. Tragic.

354
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,196
So, do you know anything?

355
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,190
- How do you mean?
- Can you...

356
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,199
...you know, use your psychic powers?
- It doesn't work like that.

357
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,955
- I only see flashes.
- No offence, dude, but...

358
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,238
...as far as superpowers go,
yours is kind of lame.

359
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,039
Thanks, anyway.

360
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,469
I do know she was
with your mate this morning.

361
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,634
My mate?

362
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,276
I saw her with your boy Sawyer.

363
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,628
The dead girl, Nikki.

364
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,112
He said he didn't know her.

365
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,316
Then why was she yelling at him?

366
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,469
Yelling?

367
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,708
- Aye.
- At Sawyer? This morning?

368
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,799
Right before she died.

369
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,119
Vincent, dude!

370
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,390
He saw Sawyer and Nikki fighting.
That doesn't prove anything.

371
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,550
Look at the facts and ask yourself,

372
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,154
why is Sawyer gung-ho
about investigating this?

373
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,516
What's in it for him?
He pretended he didn't know their names.

374
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,910
- Then he was fighting with Nikki.
- Sawyer's not a murderer.

375
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,833
He went all the way across the island
to help Michael.

376
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,639
It is The Others.
I know what they can do.

377
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,870
OK, you know what?
I'll go get Desmond.

378
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,076
He'll tell you exactly what he saw.

379
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,069
Sun?

380
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,197
It was me.

381
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,633
What?

382
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,712
It was me who took you.

383
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,151
Not The Others.

384
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,313
I wasn't myself,

385
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,872
after Locke hit me.

386
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,473
After he humiliated me.

387
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,393
Sawyer told me I could get even
by helping steal the guns.

388
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,519
We just made it look like The Others.

389
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,876
I didn't mean to hurt you.

390
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,313
I'm sorry.

391
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,479
Everybody, we're heading
to the Pearl Station.

392
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,791
There's a computer that might help us.
Anybody want to come?

393
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,518
- I'll go.
- Great.

394
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,431
- What?
- Anybody else want to come?

395
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,239
Meet us at the tree line in ten minutes
and bring water.

396
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,153
- You're not serious?
- What?

397
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,674
You always whine
about not being included.

398
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,352
Now's our chance.

399
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,799
Hey, guys?

400
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,232
What are these other TVs for?

401
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,274
Sorry?

402
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,032
All these TVs.

403
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,274
This guy says that
there are six stations.

404
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,237
Wait, here, check it out.

405
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,675
<i>Hi, I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund.</i>

406
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,915
<i>There's a monitoring station where
the activities of participants in Dharma</i>

407
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,595
<i>in our initiative projects
can be observed and recorded.</i>

408
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,030
"Projects. "
More than one.

409
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,839
Maybe some of these TVs
are connected to other hatches.

410
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,990
I'm certainly feeling very stupid.

411
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,469
Perhaps I could patch in
one of the other feeds,

412
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,357
see if we can get another picture.

413
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,951
The toilet still works.

414
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,472
- Gimme the gun.
- What the hell are you talking about?

415
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,518
Give it to me.

416
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,552
It ain't even loaded.

417
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,669
Then how are you
"sweeping the perimeter"?

418
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,909
Quit lying, dude.

419
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,719
Desmond saw you fighting with Nikki
this morning.

420
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,316
Oh, I see what this is.

421
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,276
Villagers got themselves some torches.

422
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,270
- Did you kill them?
- No.

423
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,591
No, I didn't kill them.

424
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,718
Yeah, me and Nikki went at it
this morning,

425
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,877
- because she wanted a gun.
- Why didn't you tell us this before?

426
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,356
Because of the dirt under her nails.

427
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,479
- What?
- She was digging.

428
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,079
And when we found him,
I saw a fresh mound of dirt.

429
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,878
She was burying something.

430
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,032
And if you take the time
to dig a hole right before you die,

431
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,478
then what you're hiding's
probably pretty damn good.

432
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,358
So what was it?
What did she hide?

433
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,512
Go ahead, take 'em.

434
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,077
Because whatever happened to those two,
I had nothing to do with it.

435
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,353
Did you know Thanksgiving
was two weeks ago?

436
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,110
We missed it, Paulo.
Just like we're gonna miss everything.

437
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,475
They're going to find us.

438
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,710
We'll get rescued.
You'll see.

439
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,799
OK, where did this sudden
burst of optimism come from?

440
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,351
I don't know.
I guess it's how you look at things.

441
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,959
Like the bag.

442
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,999
I mean, maybe not finding it
was good for us.

443
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,029
- How do you figure that?
- Look what it did.

444
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,708
It might've torn us apart.

445
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,594
Yeah.

446
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,873
Wait here.

447
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,191
- I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
- OK.

448
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,277
OK, I know you have them.

449
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,031
- Give me a gun!
- I don't have the guns.

450
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,838
- The A-Team took 'em all.
- Right.

451
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,275
Except for the ones
you kept for yourself.

452
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,033
Even if I had a gun,
I wouldn't give it to you.

453
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,156
Judging by the fire you're breathin',

454
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,231
I got a feelin'
no good would come of it.

455
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,518
- Sawyer, give me a gun.
- I got a better idea, sister.

456
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,990
How about you go stick your head
in the ocean and cool yourself off.

457
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,438
Thanks for nothing.

458
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,268
And who the hell are you?

459
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,758
Thanks for nothing.

460
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,920
Charlie told me it was your idea...

461
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,759
...to kidnap me.

462
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,155
- You gonna tell Jin?
- No.

463
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,515
Why not?

464
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,433
Because then
we'd have to dig another grave.

465
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,554
- Why are you giving me these?
- Because they're worthless here.

466
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,549
And I thought I was gonna
get out of this without a lecture...

467
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,358
Nikki and Paulo...

468
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,349
I guess we didn't
really know you very well.

469
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,751
And it appears
you killed each other for diamonds.

470
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,515
But I know
there were good parts to you, too.

471
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,318
You were always nice to me.

472
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,958
And you were a member of the camp.

473
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,238
<i>And... I really loved Exposé.</i>

474
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,518
OK, then.

475
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,272
- Good-bye.
- Wait.

476
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,195
Rest in peace, Nikki and Paulo.

477
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,952
- Come on, Nikki. Just tell me.
- It's a surprise.

478
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,079
We're almost there.

479
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,318
OK, ready?

480
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,677
- Yeah.
- I found the diamonds, Paulo.

481
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,716
What? Where?

482
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,398
Right here.

483
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,996
Give them to me.

484
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,712
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

485
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,308
What's this? Your nicotine gum?

486
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,515
You wanted to stop looking for the bag
because you'd already found it!

487
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,196
I know you have them.
Where are they?

488
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,191
Calm down, OK?

489
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,073
What the hell is that?

490
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,390
- Are you out of your mind?
- You remember Dr. Arzt's friend?

491
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,630
Did it bite you?

492
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,432
Does it hurt?

493
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,875
He told me why they call it
the Medusa spider.

494
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,632
Wanna know why?

495
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,638
What did you do?

496
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,392
Because one look from Medusa
would turn anyone to stone.

497
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,552
Just like one bite from this spider
will paralyze you.

498
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,676
For about eight hours.

499
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,991
It won't kill you.
It'll just slow your heart rate down

500
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,232
to the point where even a doctor
would have a hard time hearing it beat.

501
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,036
You won't be able to move a muscle,

502
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,908
so I'll be able to do all sorts
of nasty things to you.

503
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,795
And since it bit you on your neck,
I'd say paralysis will happen fast.

504
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,080
I'm guessing that
you have the diamonds on you.

505
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,953
In a shoe, maybe?

506
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,997
I think I know where.

507
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,238
Son of a bitch.

508
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,032
- I'm sorry.
- You're only sorry you got caught.

509
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,838
I was afraid of losing you.

510
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,993
If you found the diamonds,
you wouldn't need me anymore.

511
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,115
Damn it!

512
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,992
No! No! No!

513
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,717
You OK?

514
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,950
- Hey! Hey, what happened?
- Paralyzed.
