1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,060
can you hear me?

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,620
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,960
Hey, are you on a boat?


4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,290
Hey, are you on a boat?

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,830
-What--what
boat? -Your boat.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm not on a boat.

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Uh, na-naomi, the parachutist.

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,340
Who?Who's naomi?

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,940
I've got it.I've got a signal!

10
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,990
It's gonna work.It's happening.We're
gonna get off of this island.

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,300
hello?Is desmond there?

12
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,740
Penny!No!

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm telling you, making that
call is the beginning of the end.

14
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,970
Who is this?who is this?

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,990
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,380
Can you get a fix on our location?

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,120
Sit tight.

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,310
We'll be right there.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,730
it's almost 30 minutes now since
the start of this high-speed chase.

20
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,590
We still have no information
about who's driving this vehicle.

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,700
Jeff, can you tell us
where the chase started?

22
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,090
ruth, we're hearing reports that the
pursuit began near the la brea area,

23
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,600
then traveled through a warehousing
district south of the 10 freeway.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,440
Can you see how many
people are in the car?

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,680
It appears to be just
the one-- the driver.

26
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,970
We're not sure if that's
the owner of the car.

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,420
What you're seeing here are pictures
of the 10 freeway south of downtown.

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,970
Is that a camaro, jeff?

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,400
Yes, it looks like a-a
vintage, early '70s model.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,920
Damn it.

31
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,390
show us your hands!

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,100
roll down the window and
show us your hands now!

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,650
Now slowly open the
door with your left hand.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,890
Get out of the car!

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,650
Turnround...slow!

36
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,980
On the ground!

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,310
Now!

38
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,220
stop!Dot you know who I am?

39
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,130
Stop!Wait!don't you know who I am?

40
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,600
I'm one of the oceanic six!

41
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,780
I'one of the oceanic six!

42
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,230

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,660
So five minutes before you let ten cruisers
on a chase across the city,

46
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,270
you're minding your own
business in a convenience store,

47
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,270
until you see something and freak out.

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,160
Mr. Reyes, why'd you run like that?

49
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,250
Who'd you see in there?

50
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,070
Listen, buddy,

51
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,730
I know you saw somebody in that store that
made you run away and go on a high-speed--

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,150
I wasn't running away from anyone.

53
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,860
If you think I care that you're a celebrity, you
crashed your camaro in the wrong neighborhood.

54
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm not a celebrity.

55
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,460
is that why you kept shouting,
"hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"?

56
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,490
You wanna know a funny coincidence?

57
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,500
Sure.

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,360
I knew somebody your plane.

59
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,030
Really?

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,040
Her name was ana lucia cortez.

61
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,200
She was my partner
before I made detective--

62
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,430
dark hair...gorgeous.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,860
Maybe you knew her.

64
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,480
Maybe you met her on the plane...

65
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,790
before it took off?

66
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,800
Sorry.Never met her.

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,020
Why don't you watch the tape?

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,230
Maybe it'll spark something.

69
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,790
I'm gonna get a doughnut.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,550
You want one?

71
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,190
No, thanks.

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,040
And when I come back, you're
gonna tell me who you ran from.

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,790
Help!Help!

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,650
Help!

75
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,150
Let me out!

76
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,010
What the hell is wrong with you?

77
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,580
What are you doing, reyes?Huh?

78
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,720
You trying to get
tossed into the nuthouse?

79
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,270
Because if that's what you want, I can
make that happen right now, my friend.

80
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,450
You can?

81
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,420
Oh, thank you!

82
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,330
Thank you.

83
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,900
Jack?You there, dude?

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
Beach to jack, come in, jack.

85
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,960
Beach to jack.

86
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,580
Right here, hurley.What's up?

87
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,080
Hey, uh, did you guys make it
to that radio tower thingy yet?

88
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah, and I talked to
the people on the boat.

89
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,520
They're on their way
to pick us up right now.

90
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,960
Seriously?It worked?

91
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,440
Seriously.We're all on the way
back to the beach right now,

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,770
so you better pack your bags, buddy.

93
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,780
dude, that's great!

94
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,090
any luck?

95
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,880
Nothing.No sign of him.

96
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,220
It's like he just disappeared.

97
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,510
Why would locke kill her?

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,870
-He hadn't even met her-
- because he's crazy.

99
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,680
So what if he comes back?

100
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,010
If he comes back, I'm gonna kill him.

101
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,070
I'm gonna get everybod together.

102
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,510
The sooner we get back
to the beach, the better.

103
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,330
Are we really going home?

104
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,490
Yeah, we're really going home.

105
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,640
I can't believe I'm actually going
to have my baby in a hospital.

106
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,320
-Oh, rub it in, why don't you?
-Oh, no.

107
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,100
you ladies need a hand?

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,750
No, we're just wrapping
things up, thanks.

109
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,150
you know, you must be
very proud of bernard.

110
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,410
I hear he's quite the hero.

111
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,230
Look, everyone up here knows that
the real hero is your man, claire.

112
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,390
If charlie didn't turn off that gizmo,

113
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,500
we'd still be getting a busy
signal on that fancy phon

114
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,840
so you better make sure you treat
him real good when we get back.

115
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,130
Rose!

116
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,620
okay, thanks.I have enough.

117
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,200
I need you to do me a favor.

118
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,560
I need you to take alex and get
as far from here as possible.

119
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,580
-What?
-Listen to me.We don't have time for this.

120
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,770
Everyone who stays here is going to die.

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,810
Now get alex and get away right now.

122
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,360
I don't care where you gO.Just go.

123
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,390
I will not have
my daughter--

124
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,880
she's not your daughter.

125
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,060
did I ever tell you I won the lottery?

126
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,070
I got, like, $150 million.

127
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,950
Worst thing that ever happened to me.

128
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,240
Oh, yeah, who needs $150 million, right?

129
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,400
Now it'll all be gone, 'cause
they all think I'm dead.

130
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,850
When we get rescued, and I go back...

131
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,320
I'm gonna be free.

132
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,070
I wanna do a cannonball.

133
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,960
I've been walking up and down this beach
every day and looking out at this water,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,030
and I wanna do a cannonball.

135
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,620
Hurley...

136
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,870
you wanna do a cannonball, cannonball.

137
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,560
are you all right, desmond?

138
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,240
we need to get to jack.

139
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,760
We can't let him get
in touch with that boat.

140
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,580
Easy, scotty.Everything's
cool.Boat's on the way.

141
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,250
-What?
-On the way?

142
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,430
No.Hey, where's charlie?

143
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,000
No, that
woman--naomi-- she lied.

144
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,930
Look, the people on the boat
aren't who they say they are!

145
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,610
-What?
-Then who are they?

146
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,770
-Desmond, where's charlie?
-I don't know.but we need to get in touch with jack now!

147
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,620
It's all right.We can call
him.We have a walkie.It's okay.

148
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,640
-Well, where is it?
-Get it.

149
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,620
-What do you mean the people aren't
who they say- - where's charlie?

150
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm--I'm--I'm
sorry, brother.I...

151
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,100
you think that's our ride?

152
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,530
hello?

153
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,560
Hey, jack.This is George Murkowski.

154
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,500
We're trying to get a lock on your signal
there, but we're getting some rf interference.

155
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,770
We're gonna need to rejigger some
of the settings on your sat-phone.

156
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,020
Uh, sure.Okay.Just
tell me what I gotta do.

157
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,200
How about you put naomi on?

158
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,810
Naomi went to get some firewood.

159
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,120
Can you hold on for a
second?Let me see if I can...

160
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,570
where is she?

161
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,540
I don't know.

162
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,650
we gotta call the doc.

163
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,290
Did you listen to desmond?

164
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,460
-Charlie wrote on his hand-
- look, I'm sorry he's dead,

165
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,850
but I don't even know what the
hell "not penny's boat" means.

166
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,350
Calling jack accomplishes nothing.

167
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,770
It would accomplish warning him...

168
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,980
it also means warning the people on the
freighter that we're suspicious of them.

169
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,920
I have no doubt they're
monitoring our communications.

170
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,610
-If we call jack- - you
know what?I got the walkie.

171
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm making the call.

172
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,120
we better get goin'.

173
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,110
Going where?

174
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,150
I found blood--the
girl's trail.

175
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,460
Probably crawled away.

176
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,260
Can't be more than ten
minutes ahead of us.

177
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,990
We should go now and find her.

178
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,980
We're taking him with us.

179
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,150
And why would we do that?

180
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,800
Because I don't trust
him with anybody but me.

181
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,830
All right, listen up.

182
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,310
I need all of you to head back down to
the beach, and when these people show up,

183
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,380
we wanna make sure that we're
real easy for them to find, okay?

184
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,680
You look worried, jack.

185
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,270
the only thing I'm worried
about is missing our ride home.

186
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,210
I found her trail.

187
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,550
She's headed west across the island.

188
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,780
Rousseau already found it.

189
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,810
We're going after her right now.

190
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,070
What?Are you sure it's hers?

191
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,270
Unless someone else is bleeding.

192
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,720
Okay, but if she didn't want us to find
her, then she could've created a dummy trail.

193
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,740
I think we should
follow both just in c--

194
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:56,620
kate, six hours from now, we're gonna be
sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that

195
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,250
there was one final thing
that we couldn't agree upon.

196
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,740
Naomi is hurt.

197
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,120
She ran into the jungle.She's not
thinking about leaving fake trails.

198
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,630
You're right.

199
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,770
I'll track her down.

200
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,050
Why don't you get
everybody back to the beach?

201
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,930
You got it.

202
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:23,090
be careful, okay?

203
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,870
What the hell's gotten into you, hugo?

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,930
They'll all be back in the
morning.If we just wait--

205
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,910
you don't wait with warnings.You...warn.

206
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,480
Here I was thinking I was
gonna get a good night's sleep.

207
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,710
You almost got me that time.

208
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,570
How about best out of seven?

209
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,520
Are you ready for your meds, hugo?

210
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh, by the way, you have a visitor.

211
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,590
Mr. Reyes.

212
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,360
Hello.My name is matthew abbadon.

213
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,600
I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines.

214
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,560
Can we talk for a few minutes?

215
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,910
Okay.

216
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,930
I'm here, mr. Reyes, because
we've heard about your recent...

217
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,740
episode.

218
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,160
Your arrest, your
incarceration here--

219
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,860
frankly, we feel terrible about it.

220
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,100
So on behalf of oceanic, I'd like to extend
you an invitation for a little upgrade.

221
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,030
What...kind of upgrade?

222
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,230
To a facility where the paint
isn't peeling off the walls,

223
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,000
where you'd have your own bathroom.

224
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,080
-You can see the ocean from-
- I don't wanna see the ocean.

225
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,550
No problem.

226
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,010
Actually, thanks.

227
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,200
I'M...I'm fine right here.

228
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,470
Are you fine, mr. Reyes?

229
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,570
What do you mean?

230
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,300
You're in a mental institution.

231
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:46,970
Who'd you say you were again?

232
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,220
I'd like to see a business card.

233
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,070
I must have left them at home.

234
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,010
Then we're done, dude.

235
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,650
Are they still alive?

236
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,240
What?

237
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,950
You heard me.

238
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,040
Nurse!

239
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
Get out of here!

240
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,160
You better get outta here!

241
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,900
Help me!He's after me.

242
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,010
No, no, no, no.That
guy's after me!Help me!

243
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,440
You all right there, hugo?

244
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,030
Yeah, dude, I'm fine.

245
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,030
You wanna talk about it?

246
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,440
Talk about what?

247
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,360
Charlie.

248
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,350
I mean...

249
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,820
you two were buddies.I just thought...

250
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,370
we'll probably get to jack
faster if we don't talk.

251
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,650
I'm gonna head up and tell
them to slow down a little.

252
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,640
I can keep up.

253
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,300
All right, ese.

254
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,870
Just...holler if you need me.

255
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,660
Guys?

256
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,170
Guys!Guys!

257
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,340
Guys!Guys!

258
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,210
The blood trail ends here.

259
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,670
What do you mean?

260
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,960
It ends.

261
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,470
What, are you telling me that
she stopped bleeding here?

262
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,060
No, I'm telling you that she
fooled us and doubled back.

263
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,790
Better call the boat, ll 'em she's
getting a really big bundle of firewood

264
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,400
where is it?

265
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,970
Okay, I probably should have told you that I
saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, jack.

266
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,130
I owed you one.

267
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,590
What are you talking about?

268
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,470
Kate took it when she hugged you.

269
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,730
She found thright trail, too,
but you wouldn't listen to her,

270
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,540
so I guess she's taken
matters into her own hands.

271
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,680
But look on the bright sid at least somebody
around here knows what the hell they're doing.

272
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,000
hello?

273
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,310
who's this?

274
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,230
Uh, this is kate.

275
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,540
You with jack?

276
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,110
No, no, he's not here.

277
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,780
Where's naomi?

278
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,290
Uh, we're looking for her.

279
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,280
What do you mean,
you're looking for her?

280
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,430
give me the phone.

281
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,760
give me the phone.

282
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,530
Naomi, listen to me.

283
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,790
You're hurt. Let me help you.

284
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,880
Help me?

285
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,050
I just spent the last three days
trying to get you people rescued,

286
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,650
and you throw this knifen my back.

287
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,380
- No, that was not us.
- Who?

288
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,770
- His name is john locke.
- What?

289
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,340
He said that you weren't
who you said you were.

290
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,890
I swear to god we would
never hurt you. You know us.

291
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,190
please, we need your
help. Please help us.

292
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,380
Give me the phone.

293
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,980
george, it's naomi.

294
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,600
Naomi, where have you been?

295
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,250
What's going on over there?

296
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,150
I had an accident.

297
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,620
I'm hurt.

298
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,850
What? A-an accident?

299
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,780
What--what--what
accident? What happened?

300
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,420
Naomi!

301
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,120
Hello?

302
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,440
Hello?

303
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,760
I hit a tree branch
when I parachuted in.

304
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,470
Took it through my gut.

305
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,680
Why did they tell me you
were getting firewood?

306
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,630
I guess they were afraid to tell you what
happened to me till I could talk to you myself.

307
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,500
We've lost our signal,
and can't come get you.

308
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,680
Can you change your tracking frequency?

309
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,330
Yeah.

310
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,890
try it now.

311
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,510
Clear as a bell.

312
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,710
Hang on, naomi. We'll--we'll
get you back here asap, okay?

313
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,140
I'm sorry, george.

314
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,920
Just tell my sister that I love her.

315
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,630
hello?

316
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,210
help!

317
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,380
Help!

318
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,110
Help!

319
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,570
there's nothing
here.There's nothing here.

320
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,560
There's nothing
here.There's nothing here.

321
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,580
Hello, hugo.

322
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,840
You got yourself good
and lost out here, hugo.

323
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,460
How did you get
separated from the group?

324
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,240
I just...

325
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,240
fell behind, I guess.

326
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,860
Is that why you were shouting for help?

327
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,020
Well, I got scared.

328
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,000
What desmond said happened down in
that station-- "not penny's boat"...

329
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,090
are you sure that's what
charlie wrote on his hand?

330
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,060
Jack should never have
called those people.

331
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,620
I couldn't agree more.

332
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,910
It's gonna be hard to...

333
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,160
talk him into thinking they're
not coming here to rescue us.

334
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,850
Well, we're just gonna
have to try our best, hugo,

335
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,780
because if we can't
talk him out of it...

336
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,960
then charlie died for nothing.

337
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,370
Where the hell you been, hugo?

338
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,560
Sorry.

339
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,270
I was just, uh, I got lost.

340
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,550
What are you doing here?

341
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,220
I came here for the same reason you did--to
warn jack about the people on that boat.

342
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,900
I already gave it a shot, but I figured I
might have better luck with some support.

343
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,510
You want my support?

344
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,210
You can tell me why you
destroyed that submarine.

345
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,770
still in one piece.

346
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,240
Rambo.

347
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,240
I'll tell her.

348
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,680
he's dead.

349
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,320
Charlie'S... dead.

350
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,400
No.

351
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,970
I'd watch out if I were you.

352
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,810
What are you talking about, dude?

353
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,580
There's a guy over there.

354
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,400
He's staring at you.

355
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,800
What guy?

356
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,610
That guy.

357
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,850
Hey, man.

358
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,610
Don't run.

359
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,580
Hurley. Just...just...

360
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,260
sit down.

361
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,480
I wanna talk to you.

362
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,120
Come on.

363
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't do what you did
in the store. Okay?

364
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,440
There's no need to... freak out.

365
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,690
No need to freak out?

366
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,850
I'm trying to buy some
jerky and a slushee,

367
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,590
and suddenly you're standing
there over by the ho hos.

368
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,870
You're dead. What do
you expect me to do?

369
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,390
Can we just... sit down?

370
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,950
I may be in a mental hospital,
but I know you're dead,

371
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,190
and I'm not having an
imaginary conversation with you.

372
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,180
I am dead.

373
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,390
But I'm also here.

374
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,550
Okay, prove it.

375
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,950
okay. Okay.

376
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,030
Did you know you were going
to die when you swam out there?

377
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,900
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,300
Because you would have tried to stop me.

379
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,330
And since I was gonna do it anyway, I
thought I would spare you all the drama.

380
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,180
And now you have to do something.

381
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,830
But you're hiding from it.

382
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,910
That's the real reason you ran
when you saw me in the store.

383
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,730
- You knew I was here to tell you-
- no, I'm not listening to this.

384
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,240
No, 'cause you're not here.

385
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,790
I am here. You're being a baby.

386
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,810
I'm gonna close my eyes and count to
five, and when I open 'em, you'll be gone.

387
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,120
- I am here.
- One...

388
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,740
- don't do this.
- Two...

389
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,000
- they need you.
- Three...

390
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,820
- they need you, hugo.
- Four!

391
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,580
- You know they need you.
- Five!

392
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,920
What... what happened?

393
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,540
I mean, how--
how did he...

394
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,670
he was trying to help us.

395
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,570
Jack

396
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,140
You're not gonna shoot me, Jack.

397
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,500
Anymore than I was gonna shoot...

398
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,690
it's not loaded.

399
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,870
Let go of me!

400
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,560
- Do you know what he did?
- Yes, I know what he did!

401
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,310
All I did...

402
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,210
all I have ever done...

403
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,630
has been in the best
interest of all of us.

404
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,970
Are you insane?

405
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,560
I know I...

406
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,220
I have a lot of explaining to do.

407
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,590
But I never did anything
to hurt any of you.

408
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,710
I even risked my life to tell you
that there was a traitor in your midst.

409
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,980
She helped us, john.

410
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,660
All you ever did was blow up every
chance we had of getting off this island.

411
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,240
You killed naomi!

412
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,810
Well, technically, he
didn't kill her yet.

413
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,060
yes, he did.

414
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,260
She just died.

415
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,280
She didn't give you up, john.

416
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,970
She covered for us, and she fixed this.

417
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,200
They're on their way.

418
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,160
She didn't cover for anyone.

419
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,690
She wants her people to come here.

420
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,590
And trust me, when they do, we
had better be far away from here.

421
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,190
I'm going to the barracks.

422
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,680
The others abandoned them.

423
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,260
It's the only place on the isld
with any form of security right now.

424
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,690
It'll have to do until I
can think of something else.

425
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:30,980
Until then, if you want to
live, you need to come with me.

426
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,920
No one's going anywhere with you,
john, because they're not crazy.

427
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,200
he's not crazy.

428
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,290
What about charlie?

429
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,090
Charlie went down to that place
so we could all be rescued.

430
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,980
And whatever he did
down there... it worked.

431
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:01,910
But then something must've happened.

432
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,920
He must have heard
something before he...

433
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,610
I don't know why, but
it changed his mind.

434
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,690
because the last thing he did was to warn us at the
people on that boat are not who they said they were.

435
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,970
so I'm not listening to you.

436
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:49,530
I'm listening to my friend.

437
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,310
I'm listening to charlie.

438
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,020
anyone else?

439
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,340
There isn't much time.

440
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,050
Jack, with your permission,
I'd like to go with john.

441
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,070
He's all yours.

442
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,040
You said we'd never leave the island.

443
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:00,960
If you, uh, you wanna go with
locke, I'll be right behind ya.

444
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,210
I'm not going anywhere with that man.

445
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,700
What are you doing?

446
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,590
Same thing I've always done, kate...

447
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,620
survivin'.

448
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,140
you know where to find us
when you change your mind.

449
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,900
You ever miss?

450
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,080
Jack.

451
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,990
Yeah. I was, uh, on my
way back from a consult.

452
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,960
Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit.

453
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,640
Horse?

454
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,540
You're on.

455
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,720
So... consult, huh?

456
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,620
Does that mean you're
back doing surgical stuff?

457
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,430
Yeah.

458
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,750
"H."

459
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,110
Reporters leaving you alone?

460
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,140
Yeah.

461
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,970
Still have to sign some autographs
when I go out for coffee, but...

462
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,500
thinking about growing a beard.

463
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,210
You'd look weird with a beard, dude.

464
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,960
That's h-O.

465
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,910
so...

466
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,410
what are you really doing here, jack?

467
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:46,040
I was just checking on you,
seeing if everything was okay.

468
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,640
You're checking to see if i
went nuts, if i was gonna tell.

469
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,530
Are you?

470
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,510
You're up.

471
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,940
Nah, you win. I, uh...

472
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,940
gotta run.

473
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,610
It was gat seeing you, hurley.

474
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,160
I'm sorry.

475
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,650
I'm sorry I went with locke.

476
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,460
I should've stayed with you.

477
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,260
It's water under the bridge, man.

478
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,160
I don't think we did
the right thing, jack.

479
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,180
- I think it wants us to come back.

00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,530
- and it's gonna do everything
it can- - we're never going back.

481
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,820
Never say never, dude.

482
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,690
Are you thinking of charlie?

483
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:36,720
Feels like a hundred years ago
that we came out here together.

484
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,750
How did this happen?

485
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,350
thunder's getting louder.

486
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,850
that's not thunder. Come on.

487
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,510
come on.

488
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,140
