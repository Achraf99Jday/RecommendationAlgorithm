1
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,060
Where do you think you're going?

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,350
Out.

3
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,840
With who?

4
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,440
Him?

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,350
Yes, and you can't stop me.

6
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,870
I'm in love.

7
00:00:43,936 --> 00:00:45,680
He's twice your age, Emily.

8
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,028
So what, mom?

9
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,951
Are you jealous?

10
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:50,544
Emily, wait a minute.

11
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,273
Emily, listen to me!

12
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:54,902
Emily!

13
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,860
Get back here,
young lady, right now!

14
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,820
You can't stop me! I love him!

15
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:01,681
Emily!

16
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,810
Honey, can you hear me?

17
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:14,533
Honey, can you hear me?

18
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:16,593
That's good.

19
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,113
Try and stay awake now.

20
00:01:18,357 --> 00:01:20,903
Keep it steady. Out of the way.

21
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:23,460
- She's bleeding.
- Her heartbeat's dropping fast.

22
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:24,750
I'm pregnant.

23
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:25,801
What?

24
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:26,701
What did you say?

25
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:27,682
I'm pregnant.

26
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,891
I'm five...
I'm almost six months.

27
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,450
She... she's pregnant.

28
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,392
Get the clamps ready.

29
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:37,621
That's it, Emily. Good girl.

30
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:39,483
Baby's crowning.
She's crowning.

31
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:41,640
Dilated and ready to go.

32
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:43,533
That's it.

33
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:48,152
Okay, sweetheart.
All right, there you go.

34
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:50,251
Wrap you up nice and warm.

35
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:52,862
We'll just take you over here now.

36
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:55,343
Margaret, would you put
him in for me, please?

37
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,140
My baby.

38
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:01,581
It's a boy, honey.

39
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:05,862
He's okay for now.
He's just real early.

40
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:08,810
Can I hold him?

41
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:09,922
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

42
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,271
He's just too little.

43
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,073
We have to take him away now.

44
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:14,983
But...

45
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:21,571
Name... name him John.

46
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:23,133
Please!

47
00:02:23,398 --> 00:02:25,313
His name is John!

48
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,891
Who builds a cabin in the
middle of the jungle anyway?

49
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,331
That's a good question.

50
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,383
So? How about answering it?

51
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:39,703
I don't know.

52
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,691
And why are we even going there?

53
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,922
Because hopefully,
the man who lives in the cabin

54
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:47,981
can tell us what to do about the
people who are trying to kill us.

55
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,881
We've been walking all day.
Are we gonna get there soon?

56
00:02:53,486 --> 00:02:54,692
How long?

57
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,450
I don't know.

58
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,273
I've been following him.

59
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:00,490
What?

60
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:01,952
What do you mean,
you've been following him?

61
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:02,930
I'm not even in front.

62
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:04,173
I have no idea where the cabin is.

63
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:05,403
Hugo's the last one who saw it.

64
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,393
Oh, this is just awesome.

65
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,531
What do you think we should do, John?

66
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,201
We're making camp.

67
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,123
What?

68
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:18,262
Here in the dark with
the monster and...

69
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:19,743
him?

70
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,041
Well, the rest will do us good.

71
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,863
Dude, what's gonna happen when
those freighter guys come back?

72
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,993
I don't know...

73
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,203
yet.

74
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,130
Desmond.

75
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,362
The helicopter's here.

76
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:56,941
All right, get him on the litter.

77
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,661
Careful with him!

78
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,012
Get him down over there.

79
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:02,792
Be careful.

80
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,422
Okay, guys, unload it.

81
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,760
Come on. Pick it up.
Pick it up. Let's go.

82
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,591
What did this to him?

83
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,262
A black pillar of smoke threw
him 50 feet in the air...

84
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:16,993
and ripped his guts out.

85
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,362
What?

86
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,750
I need you to tell me exactly how
many people are on that island

87
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:25,133
and where every single
one of them is.

88
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,441
And why would I do that?

89
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,372
Keamy!

90
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,392
What the hell do you
think you're doing, mate?

91
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,743
You gave me up.

92
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:36,232
What?

93
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,560
Linus knew who I was.
He knew my name.

94
00:04:38,627 --> 00:04:40,831
He knew everything about me.

95
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:43,822
No, I'm not the one who gave you up.

96
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,403
Then who did?

97
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,772
Do you know who I am?

98
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,441
What?

99
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:13,401
My name.

100
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,910
Do you know my name?

101
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,340
Keamy.

102
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,540
Martin Keamy.

103
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:23,152
Did you give it to him?

104
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,380
Who?

105
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:26,060
Benjamin Linus...
did you give him my name?

106
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,132
Wait. Wait!

107
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:36,932
Martin, no!

108
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:46,190
Martin, we need him.

109
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,453
He's the only one who
can fix the engines.

110
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,332
And what makes you so sure about that?

111
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,933
Because he's the one who broke them.

112
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,233
Hello there.

113
00:06:57,138 --> 00:06:58,353
Who are you?

114
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,450
I'm Horace.

115
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,830
And what are you doing out here?

116
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,943
Oh, building a place...
a little getaway for me and the missus.

117
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:12,953
No, I mean, sometimes you need
a break from the D.I. , you know?

118
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,791
The Dharma Initiative?

119
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,952
I'm not making any sense, am I?

120
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,350
No.

121
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,272
That's probably because I've
been dead for 12 years.

122
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:47,333
Hello there.

123
00:07:58,928 --> 00:08:00,643
You gotta find me, John.

124
00:08:00,727 --> 00:08:02,251
You gotta find me.

125
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:05,372
And when you do, you'll find him.

126
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:08,341
Who?

127
00:08:08,465 --> 00:08:09,930
Jacob.

128
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:14,620
He's been waiting for you
a real long time, man.

129
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,390
I'm Horace.

130
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,760
Godspeed, John.

131
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,820
Hugo.

132
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,861
Mallomars.

133
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:47,123
Wake up, Hugo.

134
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:50,921
What?

135
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:52,510
Time to get up.
We're gonna get going.

136
00:08:52,596 --> 00:08:54,511
I thought we didn't know
where we're going, dude.

137
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,232
We do now.

138
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,393
I used to have dreams.

139
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:16,203
Dr. Miller, Dr. Miller,
please call the switchboard.

140
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,560
Hi, Emily.

141
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,848
Mrs. Locke, it's good to see you.

142
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,211
How is he?

143
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,584
He's amazing.

144
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:28,783
He's the youngest preemie to
ever survive in this hospital.

145
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:32,203
He's had infections,
pneumonia, you name it.

146
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:34,300
And every time, he knocked them out.

147
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,031
He is a fighter, your little John.

148
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:39,471
That's wonderful.

149
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,833
The other girls say
he's a miracle baby.

150
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,981
And today, we're gonna take
him out of the incubator

151
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:47,681
so you can hold him for
the very first time.

152
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,692
I...

153
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,600
I can't do this.

154
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,160
I...

155
00:10:04,335 --> 00:10:06,123
I'm sorry. I can't!

156
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,850
So who do I talk to about adoption?

157
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:20,722
You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke.

158
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:26,653
Of course.

159
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,532
I'm sorry.

160
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:33,801
Is that the father?

161
00:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,142
I, uh...

162
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,812
I don't know who that is.

163
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,082
Can I ask you somethin'?

164
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:54,542
Sure.

165
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,891
Why am I here, man?

166
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:03,102
You're here because you can see the
cabin, and that makes you special.

167
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:07,743
Well, I have a theory as to why
we're the only ones who can see it.

168
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,782
I'd love to hear it.

169
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:12,003
I think we can see it
'cause we're the craziest.

170
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:17,172
So, how'd you figure out
where it was, dude?

171
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:19,031
I didn't.

172
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,510
We're not going to the cabin.

173
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,493
We're gonna make a pit stop first.

174
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:24,111
Pit stop?

175
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:25,851
Where?

176
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:29,440
You ever wonder what happened
to the Dharma Initiative, Hugo?

177
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:35,010
There must have been at least a
hundred of 'em living on this island...

178
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:38,313
manning the stations,
building those homes,

179
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,773
making all that ranch
dressing that you like.

180
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:43,183
And then one day, they're all gone.

181
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,750
They just disappeared.

182
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,060
You want to know where we're going?

183
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,702
We're going to see them.

184
00:12:09,788 --> 00:12:11,221
What happened to 'em?

185
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,611
He did.

186
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,390
That game's stupid.

187
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,793
He's right in here. Come on in.

188
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:33,190
Melissa, stop that!

189
00:12:33,276 --> 00:12:35,442
Co on now.
Take your brother in the kitchen.

190
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:38,070
There's someone here
who wants to see John.

191
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,603
It is coming down like
cats and dogs out there.

192
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,683
This nice gentleman wants
to talk to you, John.

193
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:46,941
So I want you on your best behavior.

194
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,692
Understand?

195
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:51,993
He's all yours.

196
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:57,711
You like backgammon?

197
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,420
You seem to have a pretty
good sense of the game.

198
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,153
I'm Richard, John.

199
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:11,592
I run a school for kids who are...

200
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,473
extremely special,

201
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:18,052
and I have reason to believe
that you might be one of them.

202
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,402
Mind if I show you a couple
of really neat things?

203
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,252
Did you draw that, John?

204
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:54,132
I want you to look at these things...

205
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,552
and think about 'em.

206
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:22,612
Okay, now tell me, John,

207
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,342
which of these things belong to you?

208
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,702
T... to keep?

209
00:14:31,426 --> 00:14:33,002
No, no, John.

210
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:36,831
Which of these things
belong to you already?

211
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,173
Are you sure the knife
belongs to you, John?

212
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,673
You sure about that?

213
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,481
Well, it doesn't.

214
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:03,820
How did he do?

215
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,482
I'm afraid John isn't
quite ready for our school.

216
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,412
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

217
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,893
What did you do?

218
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:27,591
What's he doing down there?

219
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:34,863
So...

220
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,991
this is where you shot Locke
and left him for dead, huh?

221
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:43,661
Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where
you are now when I pulled the trigger.

222
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:50,860
Should have realized at the time
that it was pointless, but...

223
00:16:50,907 --> 00:16:52,982
I really wasn't thinking clearly.

224
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,981
Is that why you killed
all these people, too?

225
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:00,811
I didn't kill them.

226
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,211
Well, if the others didn't wipe
out the Dharma Initiative...

227
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,941
They did wipe them out, Hugo,

228
00:17:06,006 --> 00:17:08,191
but it wasn't my decision.

229
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,670
Then whose was it?

230
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:12,343
Their leader's.

231
00:17:13,255 --> 00:17:15,252
But I thought you were their leader.

232
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:18,523
Not always.

233
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:39,710
The cabin?

234
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,923
He was building it.

235
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:43,880
Did you find what
you were looking for?

236
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,880
Yes, Hugo. I believe I did.

237
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,472
I need your key.

238
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:55,472
What?

239
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:56,931
Captain.

240
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,573
Mayhew just died.

241
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:00,132
Doc couldn't do anything for him.

242
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:03,242
The crew's asking a lot of questions
about what happened to you guys over there.

243
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:05,293
You tell the crew that
I'm dealing with it.

244
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:07,702
Then you can go gas up
the chopper, Frank.

245
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:08,741
We're going back.

246
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:10,241
Going back?

247
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,851
- What the hell for?
- Gas up the chopper, Frank.

248
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,210
Okay.

249
00:18:18,427 --> 00:18:20,272
Listen, Martin.

250
00:18:20,356 --> 00:18:23,450
While you were gone,
there was some sort of a sickness.

251
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:26,340
The crew... they've been exhibiting
some very strange behavior.

252
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:28,683
Regina threw herself overboard,
for God's sake.

253
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,882
Now I would be derelict in my
duty if I didn't point out

254
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,530
that this might be exactly
what's happening to you.

255
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,481
I appreciate your concern.

256
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,801
Give me your key.

257
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,163
That's not the protocol...

258
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:47,323
Thank you.

259
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:57,893
The reason there are two keys is we're
only supposed to open the safe together.

260
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:59,753
You're here, aren't you?

261
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,903
What is that?

262
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:06,033
It's the secondary protocol.

263
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:11,051
What does it say?

264
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,860
It says where Linus is going.

265
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:15,810
How would Mr. Widmore know that?

266
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,830
'Cause he's a very smart man,

267
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:21,363
and if Linus knows that
we're gonna torch the island,

268
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,053
there's only one place that he can go.

269
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,443
What do you mean, "torch the island"?

270
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:27,753
That was not the agreement.

271
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,910
I agreed to ferry you here
for an extraction mission.

272
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:37,830
Fix my gun.

273
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:50,300
The injured man...

274
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,091
there was no gunshot.

275
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,871
What do you think happened to him?

276
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,042
I don't know.

277
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:02,761
But when they go back,
they'll be certain doesn't happen again.

278
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:04,980
Omar!

279
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:08,603
Keamy wants you in the armory.

280
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,941
He said I wasn't supposed to
let those two out of my sight.

281
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:12,950
I'll watch them. Go.

282
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:26,240
There's a pantry below our galley
with enough room for two men.

283
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:27,951
I've left you a supply
of food and water.

284
00:20:28,036 --> 00:20:29,053
You need to go there.

285
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:30,403
Michael... is he dead?

286
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,030
No, but not for lack
of bloody trying,

287
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,802
which is precisely why you two need to be hiding
before Keamy comes back on this deck.

288
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,030
Hiding is pointless.

289
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,410
Give us your zodiac raft so we can start
ferrying people back here from the beach.

290
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:48,820
The only way to save our lives is
to get our people off that island.

291
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,271
Meet me behind the
container in ten minutes.

292
00:20:55,407 --> 00:20:57,342
The boat will be in the water.

293
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,080
The cabin's here.

294
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,550
I came from over there.

295
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,160
Up the coast.

296
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,320
Here you go.

297
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,450
Drink up, dude.

298
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,780
Digging through dead bodies
takes it out of you.

299
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,640
It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo.

300
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,340
If you head that way,
you'll hit the coast,

301
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,710
and all you have to do is take it
north until you reach our beach.

302
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,460
Uh, what?

303
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,848
I forced you to come with us
at gun point, and I'm sorry,

304
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:33,811
Hugo, but I was led to believe that
we needed you to find this place.

305
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:34,414
Oh, I get it.

306
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,200
Now you got your magic map,
you don't...

307
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:37,410
you don't need me anymore.

308
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,003
I'm offering you a chance to leave.

309
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,033
I don't want to put you in
harm's way against your will.

310
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:46,233
And you think walking through the jungle
at night by myself is gonna be any safer?

311
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,461
I'm not sure it is.

312
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,922
I think I'll stick with you guys.

313
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:52,922
This way?

314
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:00,001
What?

315
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:02,752
He actually thinks
staying was his idea.

316
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,731
Not bad, John. Not bad at all.

317
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,480
I'm not you.

318
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,711
You're certainly not.

319
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:26,893
Somebody, let me out!

320
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,150
Please let me out.

321
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:31,951
- Please, somebody, let me...
- John, you okay?

322
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:32,871
I'm fine.

323
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:34,010
I'm fine.

324
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,213
Get to class, ladies.

325
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,950
Tardy bell just rang.

326
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:40,321
John, you're bleeding.

327
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,233
Come on.

328
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,082
Let's go to the nurse's office.

329
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:49,750
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

330
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:58,893
I know you're probably upset right now,
but I do have some exciting news for you.

331
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,300
I got a call from Portland recently.

332
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,520
There's a company up there
doing some very exciting things

333
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,793
in chemistry and new technologies.

334
00:23:07,126 --> 00:23:09,653
They're called Mittelos Laboratories.

335
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,521
I spoke with a Dr. Alpert.

336
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,491
He's very interested in finding
young, bright minds

337
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,851
to enter in these new
fields of science.

338
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:21,160
They want you to go to
their camp this summer.

339
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:23,431
Science camp?

340
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,613
Yes.

341
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,183
Don't you understand that things
like science camp are the reason

342
00:23:28,278 --> 00:23:29,921
why I get stuffed into lockers?

343
00:23:30,037 --> 00:23:32,572
- John, this is a great opportunity.
- How do they even know about me?

344
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,741
Well, they must have sent
a rep to the science fair...

345
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,541
your display at Costa Mesa.

346
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,201
I'm not a scientist!

347
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:43,131
I like boxing and
fishing and cars.

348
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:44,620
I like sports!

349
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,690
I'm gonna tell you something...

350
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:51,023
something I wish someone
had told me at your age.

351
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:56,163
You might not want to be that guy in the
labs surrounded by test tubes and beakers,

352
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,360
but that's who you are, John.

353
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:03,753
You can't be the prom king.

354
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,302
You can't be the quarterback.

355
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:11,660
You can't be a superhero.

356
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:17,752
Don't tell me what I can't do.

357
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:33,582
Why didn't you tell me?

358
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:35,662
Tell you what?

359
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,970
That you're a survivor of 815.

360
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,982
'Cause you wouldn't
have believed me.

361
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,511
You didn't think
I'd believe you?

362
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:45,722
I tell you that I'm one of
the only people in the world

363
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,660
that think that that plane on the
bottom of the ocean is a hoax,

364
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:50,232
and you didn't think
I'd believe you?

365
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:51,693
I didn't know if I could trust you.

366
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,402
Your boss put that plane there.

367
00:24:55,565 --> 00:24:58,680
Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy,
but you got me beat there.

368
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:02,621
Listen to me.

369
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:03,653
Listen to me.

370
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,882
You can't fly that
guy back... Keamy.

371
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:07,532
You let me worry about Keamy,
all right?

372
00:25:07,576 --> 00:25:08,731
You can't fly him back!

373
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,751
He is gonna kill
everyone on that island.

374
00:25:11,828 --> 00:25:12,770
Everyone.

375
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:17,281
And you don't want that
on your conscience, man.

376
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,822
Trust me.

377
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:36,202
Hey, boss.

378
00:25:37,046 --> 00:25:38,873
Just getting him down
to the engine room.

379
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,080
Stay on a heading
of exactly 3-0-5.

380
00:25:51,358 --> 00:25:53,712
Faraday says that's the only
safe way to and from the boat.

381
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:56,190
What will you tell Keamy if he
notices the zodiac is missing?

382
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,421
I'll tell him you stole it.

383
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,552
Now go.

384
00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:08,961
Desmond.

385
00:26:09,446 --> 00:26:10,491
I can't go with you.

386
00:26:10,957 --> 00:26:11,952
Why not?

387
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,272
I've been on that
island for three years.

388
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,860
I'm never setting
foot on it again...

389
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,830
Not when Penny's coming for me.

390
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:25,963
I'll be back with the first
group as soon as I can.

391
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:29,143
Stay on that bearing, yeah?

392
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:31,532
I will.

393
00:26:31,898 --> 00:26:33,540
You need to go now.

394
00:27:02,266 --> 00:27:05,150
It should be about
200 yards this way.

395
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:07,003
You sure it's gonna be there, John?

396
00:27:08,647 --> 00:27:09,460
I'm sorry?

397
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,062
The cabin...
what if it's moved again?

398
00:27:12,118 --> 00:27:16,191
It hasn't moved because I was told
that this is where it would be.

399
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:21,703
I was told a lot of things, too...
that I was chosen, that I was special.

400
00:27:22,085 --> 00:27:26,311
I end up with a tumor on my spine and
my daughter's blood all over my hands.

401
00:27:28,418 --> 00:27:30,993
I'm sorry those things
happened to you, Ben.

402
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,343
Those things had
to happen to me.

403
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:37,622
That was my destiny.

404
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:43,872
But you'll understand soon enough that
there are consequences to being chosen...

405
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:51,103
Because, destiny, John,
is a fickle bitch.

406
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:55,521
Guys?

407
00:27:58,438 --> 00:27:59,592
Cabin.

408
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,083
Okay, okay, okay.

409
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:34,670
Good job, man.

410
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:35,421
Good job, John.

411
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,481
Okay, we'll try it
some more tomorrow.

412
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:39,340
He's all yours.

413
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,693
Come on up.

414
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:43,473
It's all right. Come on.

415
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:49,131
Don't give up, Mr. Locke.

416
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:52,092
Excuse me?

417
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:53,893
I'm just saying, don't give up.

418
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,393
Anything's possible.

419
00:28:57,808 --> 00:28:59,553
You should read my file.

420
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:02,583
My spine was crushed.

421
00:29:02,746 --> 00:29:06,282
There's a 98% chance I'll never
get any feeling back in my legs.

422
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:10,803
- So I don't know why I'm even trying to...
- As a matter of fact, I did read your file.

423
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:14,021
You survived falling eight
stories out of a building.

424
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,200
That's a miracle, Mr. Locke.

425
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:24,441
Let me ask you something.

426
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,721
Do you believe in miracles?

427
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:29,603
No.

428
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,822
I don't believe in miracles.

429
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,873
You should.

430
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,010
I had one happen to me.

431
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:45,151
Hey, look.
I just want to go back to my room.

432
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:55,350
You know what you need, Mr. Locke?

433
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:59,832
You need to go on a walkabout.

434
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:03,063
Wha... what's a walkabout?

435
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:05,590
It's a journey of self-discovery.

436
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:11,818
You go out into the Australian outback
with nothing more than a knife and your wits.

437
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:15,041
I can't "walkabout" anything.

438
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:18,344
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a cripple.

439
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,943
Is that what you are, Mr. Locke?

440
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,862
I went on my walkabout convinced I was
one thing, but I came back another.

441
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:32,462
I found out what I was made of,
who I was.

442
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:35,731
And here you are, an orderly.

443
00:30:38,476 --> 00:30:41,253
Oh, I'm a lot more than
just an orderly, John.

444
00:30:58,215 --> 00:30:59,752
When you're ready, Mr. Locke...

445
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,182
You'll listen to what I'm saying.

446
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:05,810
And then when you and me
run into each other again...

447
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,371
You'll owe me one.

448
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:37,733
Hey, doc.
Wanna hear something weird?

449
00:31:39,178 --> 00:31:40,462
Yeah, sure.

450
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:43,642
You know that Morse code message
that I got from the beach?

451
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:47,141
It said that the doctor washed up
on the shore with his throat slit.

452
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:50,363
But I'm the doctor.

453
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,420
Crazy, right?

454
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:54,591
Everything here?

455
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:56,030
Yes, sir.

456
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,520
Good. Get it packed up.

457
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,100
What are you gonna
do with all that?

458
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:08,123
Fire her up, Frank.

459
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:13,410
Mr. Keamy,
I was hired to fly scientists.

460
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,583
Get your ass in the cockpit
and fire up the chopper, Frank.

461
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:19,863
I'm not taking you.

462
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,231
I'll kill you, Frank.

463
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,981
Yeah, well, you do that,
you'll never get back to the island

464
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,831
'cause I'm the only
pilot you got.

465
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:42,530
Sorry, doc.

466
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,992
That changes anything,
Frank? Huh?

467
00:32:53,355 --> 00:32:55,813
Another 30 seconds goes by
and someone else's turn...

468
00:33:00,038 --> 00:33:01,291
I fixed your gun.

469
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:08,602
Now stand down,
Martin, or I will fire.

470
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:19,911
I don't think you want
to do that, captain.

471
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,090
What's that on his arm?

472
00:33:23,016 --> 00:33:24,312
What's that on his arm?

473
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:40,802
What'll it be, Frank?

474
00:33:43,747 --> 00:33:44,942
We're flying.

475
00:33:50,666 --> 00:33:51,463
Come on. Let's go, boys.

476
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:52,131
Come on!

477
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,203
Let's go!

478
00:34:14,828 --> 00:34:16,130
Thanks, captain.

479
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:21,563
Come on! Come on!
Come on! come on!

480
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:22,370
Let's go!

481
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,423
Hey! What did I say to you?

482
00:34:58,617 --> 00:35:00,102
You told me not to leave my tent.

483
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:02,420
I was hungry.

484
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:04,171
Jack, you have to rest.

485
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:05,713
You can't run around.

486
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:09,311
I know that it is hard for you to ask
for help, but if you tear your stitches...

487
00:35:09,397 --> 00:35:10,663
Okay. Okay.

488
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:12,633
I got it.

489
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:15,041
Doctors make the worst patients.

490
00:35:58,507 --> 00:35:59,362
Jack!

491
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:30,691
I think they want us to follow 'em.

492
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:46,433
All right.

493
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,451
Let's do this.

494
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:50,212
I'm not going in there with you.

495
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,231
What?

496
00:36:52,348 --> 00:36:56,600
The island wanted me to get sick,
and it wanted you to get well.

497
00:36:58,515 --> 00:37:00,200
My time is over, John.

498
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,342
It's yours now.

499
00:37:05,968 --> 00:37:09,803
Yeah, I'm cool with you
going in alone, too.

500
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:21,070
Good luck, John.

501
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:25,503
Are you Jacob?

502
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:28,871
No.

503
00:38:31,368 --> 00:38:33,640
But I can speak on his behalf.

504
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:44,710
Well, who are you?

505
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm Christian.

506
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:12,922
You know why I'm here?

507
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:16,980
Yeah, sure.

508
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,111
Do you?

509
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:25,543
I'm here...

510
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:29,701
because I was chosen to be.

511
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:35,990
That's absolutely right.

512
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:49,641
Claire?

513
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:52,223
Hi, John.

514
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:54,733
What are you doing here?

515
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:56,171
Don't worry. I'm fine.

516
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:57,252
I'm with him.

517
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,280
Wh... where's the baby?

518
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:05,953
The baby's where he's supposed to be,
and that's not here.

519
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:12,132
It's probably best that you don't
tell anyone that you saw her.

520
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:13,062
Why?

521
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:15,523
- Why is she...
- We don't have time for this.

522
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,123
The people from the boat are
already on their way back,

523
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:22,880
and once they get here, all of these
questions won't matter one bit.

524
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,500
So why don't you ask the one
question that does matter?

525
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:38,093
How do I save the island?

526
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:54,762
Did he tell you what
we're supposed to do?

527
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:58,233
He did.

528
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:01,411
Well?

529
00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:05,762
He wants us to move the island.
