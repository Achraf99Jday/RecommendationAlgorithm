1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,410
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,140
Miles here and three of his people

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,050
came to the island about a week ago.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,440
- Share with us exactly why they're here.
- We're here for him.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,450
Problem solved.
How soon do we turn him over?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,560
We can't turn him over.
Once they have me,

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,390
their orders are to kill
everyone else on the island.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,160
- He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.
- It's Michael.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:22,950
Pull!

10
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:27,630
- What are you guys doing?
- We're shooting things.

11
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:30,388
This is a map to the temple.
It's a sanctuary.

12
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:32,401
It may be the last safe
place on this island.

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,424
If you leave now,
you can get there in a day and a half.

14
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:35,781
Your mother will protect you.

15
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:44,560
Karl? No!

16
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:47,290
Come on. Come on.
He's gone. No! No!

17
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,881
Wait! Wait! Don't!
I'm Ben's daughter!

18
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:56,783
I'm his daughter!

19
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:37,973
You got a prescription for that?

20
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:40,240
Yeah.

21
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:42,573
I wrote it myself.

22
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:49,591
You look terrible.

23
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,281
Well, thanks.

24
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:53,622
What are those?

25
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,753
Antibiotics. I just got a...

26
00:01:58,565 --> 00:01:59,962
a stomach bug.

27
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,582
You should eat some crackers.

28
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,010
Crackers always make
me feel better.

29
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:14,123
Why aren't they back
from the boat yet, Jack?

30
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:17,903
Well, Sayid said
the engine was down.

31
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,973
My guess is they're
trying to fix it

32
00:02:19,978 --> 00:02:22,650
and wondering why the hell they
can't get in touch with us.

33
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,302
- And you're not worried?
- No.

34
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,870
My gut says we're
getting off this island.

35
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,683
I thought your gut was sick.

36
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:35,651
Help! I need some help! Help!

37
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,583
Help! I need help!

38
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,101
I need some help down here!

39
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:49,960
The dog was barking.
I didn't see him.

40
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,823
I got him. Flip.

41
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:18,761
Do you know who this is?

44
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:32,843
We're all gonna die.

45
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,613
Calm down, chicken little.

46
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:37,643
The sky ain't falling just yet.

47
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,863
This is exactly what he wants...
to fight amongst ourselves.

48
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:43,313
- You're making a big mistake, dude.
- It's his to make, Hugo.

49
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:47,443
Let's get on with it.

50
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:51,753
Right.

51
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:56,892
I'm attackin' Siberia.

52
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:02,822
Sorry.

53
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,132
Can't believe you're just
giving him Australia.

54
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,961
- Australia's the key to the whole game.
- Says you.

55
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,323
Stop here. On your knees.

56
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:20,572
Get on your knees.

57
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:30,832
Hey. Turn this thing off.

58
00:04:35,346 --> 00:04:36,500
P... please.

59
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,573
There's a baby with them.

60
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:40,050
Just promise you won't...

61
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,620
Turn the fence off.

62
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:54,790
Okay. It's off.

63
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,283
Code 14-J.

64
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:15,040
Code 14-J.

65
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:16,663
Code 14-J.

66
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:17,500
Who is it?

67
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,753
- Code 14-J.
- I think it's for Ben.

68
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:40,270
What's "code 14-J"?

69
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,273
Where did you hear that?

70
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,133
The phone rang. I picked it up.

71
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,442
A voice kept repeating
"Code 14-J".

72
00:05:49,456 --> 00:05:50,693
We need to get to the other house.

73
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:51,711
It's easier to fortify,

74
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:53,351
and we'll have better
position on the tree lines.

75
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,461
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:55,763
They're here.

77
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:07,911
Hello.

78
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,622
No, no, no, no. Wait.

79
00:07:19,796 --> 00:07:22,090
Wait. I can explain.
Do... do you speak English?

80
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:35,833
Sure. Sure.

81
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:48,723
Ah. Okay.

82
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,310
Okay. Okay.

83
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,863
Okay.

84
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:54,500
This...

85
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,573
Surrender! Surrender!

86
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,241
Oh, so you do speak English.

87
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,040
Yah!

88
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,120
Let me guess. "14-J" ain't
the code for the pizza boy.

89
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:37,171
It's an early warning system.

90
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,491
- Warning for what?
- Somebody tripped

91
00:08:39,495 --> 00:08:41,253
the panic switch at
our security fence.

92
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,633
That means one of my
people's been captured.

93
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,850
How long did you guys
debate amongst yourselves

94
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:47,950
whether or not to ask
me why the phone rang?

95
00:08:48,836 --> 00:08:49,881
Five minutes.

96
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:52,461
Well, so much for
our head start.

97
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:54,271
Hold up. If we're hunkerin' down,

98
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:56,753
- I gotta grab Frenchie and the kids.
- Don't bother. They're safe.

99
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,801
- I sent Rousseau, Alex and Karl away yesterday.
- Away where?

100
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,150
Whatever. Claire's still sleepin'.
I'll grab her.

101
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:05,583
There's no time.

102
00:09:05,868 --> 00:09:06,950
I'll make time.

103
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:11,323
It's very important
that you survive

104
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:12,440
what's about to
happen here, John.

105
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:15,780
- So I need you to stay close to me.
- And why would I do that?

106
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:18,061
Because the people that are
coming won't risk hurting me.

107
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:20,563
You want to live?
I'm your best chance.

108
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,880
His throat was slit.

109
00:09:31,497 --> 00:09:32,783
Know anything about that?

110
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,942
No. Uh,
he was fine when I last saw him.

111
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,331
Which was when?

112
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:40,582
When?

113
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,750
"When" is kind of a relative term.

114
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,270
We don't know anything about this.

115
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:51,203
Any luck fixing the sat-phone?

116
00:09:52,787 --> 00:09:53,963
Uh, yeah. Sorry, no.

117
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:56,790
The, uh, Mike was...
smashed pretty good.

118
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,830
Best-case scenario,

119
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:02,013
- we'd only be able to broadcast tone squelch... beeps and boops.
- Well, yeah,

120
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,851
but you could still use it as
sort of a telegraph, right?

121
00:10:05,227 --> 00:10:07,410
If I had some strips
of ferrous metal,

122
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,840
Uh, a 9-volt battery clip

123
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,333
and some... wiring.

124
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:15,240
- We got a bunch of stuff that we salvaged from the plane.
- Great.

125
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,503
I'll show you where it is.

126
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,622
Bernard, you got a second?

127
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:32,883
These people who are coming...

128
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,270
- you're scared of 'em, aren't you?
- That's right, John. I am.

129
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:38,271
What's going on?

130
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:43,733
Get away from the window, Hugo.

131
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,811
- How's Sawyer gonna get back in?
- He's not.

132
00:10:55,477 --> 00:10:57,653
Hey. Did you see if Claire left
her house this morning?

133
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,911
What's going on?
Why do you have that?

134
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:01,851
Just get back inside and wait until...

135
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,673
Get back inside! Aah!

136
00:11:10,497 --> 00:11:11,600
Get inside!

137
00:11:23,995 --> 00:11:24,972
Claire!

138
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,081
Claire!

139
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,390
Claire!

140
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,651
Good afternoon, sir.

141
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,593
Good afternoon.
I'd like a room, please.

142
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,440
Of course, sir.
Is this your first time in Tunisia?

143
00:12:18,408 --> 00:12:20,580
No, but it's been a while.

144
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:23,248
Your name?

145
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,891
I'm actually a preferred guest.

146
00:12:25,897 --> 00:12:28,574
It should be under "Dean Moriarty".

147
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,830
Certainly, Mr. Moriarty.

148
00:12:42,517 --> 00:12:44,501
May I help you with anything else?

149
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,210
Yes. Um, today's date is...

150
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:50,581
- October 24th, sir.
- 2005?

151
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,261
Yes, sir. 2005.

152
00:12:57,205 --> 00:12:58,020
Thank you.

153
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:01,691
... Sayid Jarrah...

154
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:10,690
... Sayid Jarrah...

155
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:13,300
Please. I just want to
bury my wife in peace.

156
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,010
Right now I need you to
tell me what's going on.

157
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:33,633
I think the technical
term is "shock and awe".

158
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:35,900
They're trying to frighten
me into surrendering.

159
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,461
Well, why did they
stop shooting?

160
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:41,341
Was that Claire's house?
Claire was there.

161
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:43,531
Hugo, get the baby
away from the window.

162
00:13:44,026 --> 00:13:45,282
Put him in the back room.

163
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,901
You said I need to
survive this. Why?

164
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,832
Because there's only one
person that can help us now,

165
00:13:53,865 --> 00:13:56,340
and that's Jacob,
and we have to go to him together.

166
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:58,491
What makes you think
I can find him?

167
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:00,421
I... I don't even know
where the cabin is.

168
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:03,392
I know, but Hurley does.

169
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,111
Claire!

170
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:07,922
Claire!

171
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,320
Claire!

172
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:15,382
Claire!

173
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:20,492
Are you okay?

174
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:23,302
Charlie?

175
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,502
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Where's Aaron? Where's Aaron?

176
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:28,342
He's with us. It's okay.
We're gonna move now.

177
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,673
Let's go.

178
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:39,261
Open the front door!

179
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:48,922
Hugo, you don't want to do that.

180
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:54,441
Open the damn door!

181
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,212
Open the door!

182
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:59,481
Open the damn door!

183
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:09,821
Careful.

184
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:11,941
Is she all right?

185
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:14,120
She got her bell rung,
but she's gonna be all right.

186
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:21,392
They just started shooting. Why?

187
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,562
Why slaughter people without
even telling us what they want?

188
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,672
Those people were murdered
to make you angry, James.

189
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,031
So you'd be more likely
to come storming in here

190
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,952
- and throw me to the wolves.
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

191
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,560
Sounds like a great plan to me.
What do you say, on three?

192
00:15:45,466 --> 00:15:46,653
I wouldn't if I were you.

193
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,631
Shut up!

194
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,673
Miles?

195
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:10,710
Who the hell let you out?

196
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,280
The people who gave me this.

197
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:17,422
They want to talk.

198
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:03,192
You vultures, you followed me
to Tikrit... to spy on me?!

199
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:11,051
What are you doing here?

200
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,762
I'm here to find the man
who murdered your wife.

201
00:18:23,968 --> 00:18:25,101
How did you get here?

202
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,970
I came across the Syrian border.

203
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,962
- It's really not as difficult as you might...
- How did you get off

204
00:18:29,995 --> 00:18:31,120
the island?

205
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:32,562
Your friend Desmond had a boat.

206
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,411
Remember? "The Elizabeth".

207
00:18:35,386 --> 00:18:37,052
I followed a heading to Fiji.

208
00:18:38,216 --> 00:18:39,763
Then I chartered a plane.

209
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,441
Why now?

210
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:47,200
You remember the name Charles Widmore,
don't you?

211
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:50,213
The man who tried to
convince the world

212
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,123
that your plane was on
the bottom of the ocean?

213
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:55,501
What does it have to do with me?
With Nadia?

214
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,812
There was a man at her procession.

215
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:01,781
He goes by the name
of Ishmael Bakir.

216
00:19:02,448 --> 00:19:04,121
He's one of Widmore's men.

217
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:08,743
Bakir was last seen five days ago

218
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,131
in Los Angeles,

219
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:13,510
caught by a traffic camera,

220
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:17,410
speeding away from the corner
of La Brea and Santa Monica.

221
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:25,543
That's three blocks from
where Nadia was killed.

222
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:36,393
Why would these people
want to murder her?

223
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:37,543
I don't know.

224
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,861
But they did.

225
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:55,702
How many of 'em are there?

226
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:58,681
Maybe six. I'm not sure.

227
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,531
The hell you mean,
you ain't sure?

228
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,461
You came over on the same boat
with 'em, didn't ya?

229
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,130
They told me they
were just security.

230
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,482
- Security for what?
- For him.

231
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:09,140
Once they got him,
to escort him back to the mainland.

232
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:10,682
Well, Miles, sounds like

233
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,862
you're not gonna collect
your $3.2 million.

234
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:16,761
Just take it.

235
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,421
Why would I talk to them?

236
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:20,791
Because they have a hostage.

237
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,042
Well, then they've
badly miscalculated,

238
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,571
cause every single
one of my people

239
00:20:24,607 --> 00:20:27,632
- is prepared to die in service to this island.
- It's your daughter!

240
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:45,310
Hello?

241
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,162
Am I speaking to Benjamin Linus?

242
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:52,363
That's right.

243
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,113
My name is Martin Keamy.

244
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,403
I'm an employee of Charles Widmore.

245
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,551
- Who's Charles Widmore?
- Later.

246
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,692
I'd like you to go look
out your east window

247
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,951
so we can talk about
this face-to-face.

248
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:12,312
To the left.

249
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:15,371
You see me?

250
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,673
Yeah, I see you.

251
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:21,640
All right, Mr. Linus,
these are my terms.

252
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,212
You're gonna step out the front door,

253
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:24,362
put your hands above your head,

254
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,120
and you're gonna walk straight to me.

255
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:29,190
Once I have you in my custody,
then I promise you

256
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:31,271
that no one else in that
house will be harmed.

257
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:37,682
You and I both know
that once you have me,

258
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:38,702
there's nothing to stop you

259
00:21:38,737 --> 00:21:40,822
from killing everybody
else on this island.

260
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,282
What kind of guy do you think I am?

261
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:46,191
Martin Christopher Keamy...

262
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:49,023
former first sergeant,
United States marine corps,

263
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:52,110
served with distinction
from 1996 to 2001.

264
00:21:52,117 --> 00:21:53,080
But since then,

265
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,302
you've worked with a number
of mercenary organizations,

266
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:57,640
specifically in Uganda.

267
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:02,882
So I know exactly what kind
of man you are, Mr. Keamy,

268
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,970
and we can dispense
with the formalities.

269
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:10,072
Okay, Ben. You got it.

270
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,582
Get down.

271
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,802
Get your ass out here right now...

272
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:38,921
Or I'm gonna kill your daughter.

273
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:53,751
I'd like to present
a counterproposal.

274
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,231
I'm listening.

275
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,291
You and your friends...

276
00:23:02,496 --> 00:23:03,782
turn around.

277
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:06,061
Walk back to your helicopter.

278
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:09,411
Fly away and forget you
ever heard of this island.

279
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,263
Tell your daddy good-bye.

280
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:23,871
Dad...

281
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:25,380
they're serious.

282
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:29,583
They killed Karl and my mother.

283
00:23:30,418 --> 00:23:31,421
Alex...

284
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,932
I have this under control.

285
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,453
Everything's gonna be okay.

286
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:37,223
Please, daddy!

287
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:40,663
Please. Please.

288
00:23:43,075 --> 00:23:44,722
You have ten seconds, Ben.

289
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,321
Okay, listen.

290
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:47,562
Nine...

291
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:50,111
She's not my daughter.

292
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:51,551
Eight...

293
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,312
I stole her as a baby
from an insane woman.

294
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:57,813
She's a pawn, nothing more.

295
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,703
She means nothing to me.

296
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:09,013
I'm not coming
out of this house.

297
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,073
So if you want to kill her,
go ahead and do it...

298
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:40,792
I don't see 'em.

299
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:43,712
They just left her body there
and disappeared into the jungle.

300
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,111
They won't be gone for long.

301
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,282
It's gonna be dark
in about 20 minutes,

302
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,871
and then they're
gonna come for him.

303
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:53,721
Then let's just hand him over.

304
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,052
I don't think these people
have any intentions

305
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,203
of letting us walk of
here alive, James,

306
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,681
No matter what we do.

307
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,813
Well, I ain't got no
intention of dyin'.

308
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:06,403
He changed the rules.

309
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,792
What? Who?

310
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:11,801
What rules?

311
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:20,553
You know I'm right.

312
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:23,872
Our best chance here is to toss
him out and fend for ourselves.

313
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:28,780
Hey! Where you goin'?

314
00:25:31,756 --> 00:25:33,180
Open this damn door!

315
00:25:34,585 --> 00:25:35,692
Open up!

316
00:26:58,358 --> 00:26:59,553
Walk.

317
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:08,132
Who are you and why
are you following me?

318
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:10,521
My name is Benjamin Linus.

319
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:17,052
And I need you to take a message
to Mr. Widmore for me.

320
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:19,050
And what message is that?

321
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:36,511
That should do it.

322
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:40,970
Wait.

323
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,101
Where do you think you're going?

324
00:27:44,836 --> 00:27:46,381
We're finished here, Sayid.

325
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:48,721
Turn around and walk away.

326
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,562
Mourn your loss.
Get on with your life.

327
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:55,693
I have no life.
They took it from me.

328
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:57,592
Go home, Sayid.

329
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,063
Once you let your
grief become anger,

330
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,652
it will never go away.

331
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:05,143
I speak from experience.

332
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,222
This is my war. It's not yours.

333
00:28:12,805 --> 00:28:15,512
I spent the last
eight years of my life

334
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,822
searching for the woman I love.

335
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:22,133
I finally found her and I married her.

336
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:26,932
And I buried her yesterday.

337
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:29,703
So don't tell me this is not my war.

338
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:38,033
Benjamin...

339
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:41,362
Who's next?

340
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:46,083
I'll be in touch.

341
00:28:55,898 --> 00:28:57,221
Open the damn door!

342
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,361
Son of a bitch just left us here.

343
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:02,381
- Open the damn door!
- What's going on?

344
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:03,770
Claire?

345
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:10,082
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Yeah, a bit wobbly, but, uh, I'll live.

346
00:29:10,108 --> 00:29:11,743
Well, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

347
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:17,092
Excuse me, James.

348
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,041
Excuse you?

349
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,350
What were you doing in there?

350
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,023
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

351
00:29:25,048 --> 00:29:27,171
I need all of you to
do exactly as I say.

352
00:29:27,177 --> 00:29:29,850
In a minute, we have to run from
this house as fast as we can.

353
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,792
At that moment, when I give the order,
I want you to head

354
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:34,461
straight for the tree line.

355
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,033
You mean towards
the guys with guns?

356
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:41,643
No, we want to be as far
away from them as possible.

357
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:10,300
Okay, outside. Outside now!

358
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:29,991
What did you do?!

359
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,770
Did you just call that thing?

360
00:30:51,238 --> 00:30:52,070
Fall back!

361
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,261
Go! Go, go!

362
00:30:55,607 --> 00:30:57,481
Head for the trees.
I'll catch up with you.

363
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,840
Hey, where are you going?

364
00:30:59,755 --> 00:31:02,521
I have to say good-bye
to my daughter, John.

365
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:09,942
I can't believe it.

366
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,353
Might actually have a signal.

367
00:32:13,718 --> 00:32:14,860
What are you sending?

368
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,511
"what... "

369
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:20,710
"happened...

370
00:32:21,045 --> 00:32:21,953
"to...

371
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:25,893
the... doctor? "

372
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:56,970
Okay. They didn't exactly say
what happened to the doctor,

373
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,693
but your friends are fine,

374
00:32:58,695 --> 00:33:01,671
and the helicopter's coming
back in... in the morning.

375
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:04,662
Well?

376
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:05,863
He's lying.

377
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:08,990
What the message said was,
"What are you talking about?

378
00:33:09,578 --> 00:33:11,282
The doctor is fine".

379
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,331
You know Morse code.

380
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:25,960
What does that mean...

381
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:28,813
"the doctor is fine"?

382
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,503
I don't know.

383
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:32,983
Why are you lying?

384
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,470
Why did you say

385
00:33:36,667 --> 00:33:38,821
that the helicopters
are coming back?

386
00:33:40,866 --> 00:33:41,910
Jack.

387
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,852
Were you ever...
gonna take us off this island?

388
00:33:52,205 --> 00:33:53,100
No.

389
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:56,300
No.

390
00:34:06,156 --> 00:34:07,792
- Jack.
- No.

391
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:29,402
I think your chopper
buddies ran that way,

392
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:30,772
if you wanna catch up.

393
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:34,112
Yeah, I think I'll stay
with you guys for... for now.

394
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:56,303
Sorry about your daughter.

395
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:00,332
Thank you, John.

396
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,571
That being said, you lied to me.

397
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:06,660
You told me you didn't know
what the smoke monster was.

398
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:10,593
You can ask Jacob all about
it when we go to the cabin.

399
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,343
Hang on. "Jacob"?

400
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:18,272
Who the hell's Jacob?

401
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,250
He's the man that's gonna tell
us what to do next, James.

402
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:26,072
You know what?
I'm done with all this.

403
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,003
I never should have followed
you wackos in the first place.

404
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:31,621
I'm goin' back to the beach,
and Claire and the kid

405
00:35:31,656 --> 00:35:34,862
are comin' with me.
You good with that?

406
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,471
Yeah, I'm good with that.

407
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:39,463
I'm coming with you.

408
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:44,083
Let's go. You too, Hurley.

409
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,843
Have you lost your mind?

410
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,380
Hugo stays with us.

411
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:04,463
- Not a chance.
- Wait. Leave me out of this.

412
00:36:04,468 --> 00:36:06,822
I'm sorry, Hugo.
We need you to find the cabin.

413
00:36:06,825 --> 00:36:08,082
He ain't goin' anywhere with you,

414
00:36:08,115 --> 00:36:11,672
- you crazy son of a bitch.
- Stop! Put the guns down. I'll go with Locke.

415
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,143
- Hugo.
- It's okay, Sawyer.

416
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,342
Please, put your gun down.

417
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:23,722
You too.

418
00:36:24,465 --> 00:36:25,953
You don't have to do this.

419
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,301
You guys go back to the beach.
I'll catch up sooner or later.

420
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:43,193
You harm so much as one
hair on his curly head...

421
00:36:44,398 --> 00:36:45,522
I'll kill you.

422
00:36:47,156 --> 00:36:48,092
Fair enough.

423
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:59,700
Let's go. Go. Move.

424
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:12,460
Which way?

425
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,880
Thank you.

426
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,453
Good evening, sir. May I help you?

427
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:46,560
Oh, yes. I'm here to see
Mr. and Mrs. Kendrick in 4E.

428
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:48,820
At this hour, sir?

429
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:50,753
They're expecting me.

430
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,661
Feel free to call up.

431
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:59,271
No need, sir. Good night, sir.

432
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,622
Wake up, Charles.

433
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,842
I wondered when you
were gonna show up.

434
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:15,280
I see you've been getting more sun.

435
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:17,581
Iraq is lovely this time of year.

436
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,360
When did you start sleeping with
a bottle of Scotch by the bed?

437
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,953
When the nightmares started.

438
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:40,153
Have you come here to
kill me, Benjamin?

439
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,283
We both know I can't do that.

440
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:47,220
Then why are you here?

441
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:52,992
I'm here, Charles,

442
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:55,040
because you murdered my daughter.

443
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:58,291
Don't stand there, looking at me

444
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,222
with those horrible eyes of yours

445
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,880
and lay the blame for the
death of that poor girl on me,

446
00:40:05,055 --> 00:40:06,860
when we both know very well

447
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:09,740
I didn't murder her at all, Benjamin.

448
00:40:11,148 --> 00:40:12,272
You did.

449
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,580
No, that's not true.

450
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:18,313
Yes, Benjamin, it is.

451
00:40:19,476 --> 00:40:23,621
You creep into my bedroom in
the dead of night like a rat

452
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:28,011
and have the audacity to
pretend that you're the victim?

453
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:32,513
I know who you are, boy...

454
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:34,260
What you are.

455
00:40:35,705 --> 00:40:38,421
I know that everything
you have, you took from me.

456
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:45,420
So... once again I ask you,

457
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,463
why are you here?

458
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:51,421
I'm here, Charles,

459
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:54,550
to tell you that I'm going
to kill your daughter.

460
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:00,221
Penelope, is it?

461
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,741
And once she's gone...

462
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,002
Once she's dead...

463
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:11,581
then you'll understand how I feel.

464
00:41:15,158 --> 00:41:17,501
And you'll wish you
hadn't changed the rules.

465
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:26,360
You'll never find her.

466
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:32,173
That island's mine, Benjamin.

467
00:41:32,805 --> 00:41:36,011
It always was. It will be again.

468
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:40,121
But you'll never find it.

469
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:44,393
Then I suppose the hunt
is on for both of us.

470
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,263
I suppose it is.

471
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,722
Sleep tight, Charles.
