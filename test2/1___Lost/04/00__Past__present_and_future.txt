00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,300
A PLANE FELL OUT OF THE SKY ??

172
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,700
OF COURSE WE SAW IT.

173
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
♪♪♪

174
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,300
324 PEOPLE ON BOARD INCL.THE FLIGHT GROUP.

175
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,700
I WANT DETAIL FILES ON EVERY SINGLE PASSENGER.

176
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,700
THE FILES WOULD REVEAL THAT

177
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,900
THE SPINAL SURGEON WAS ON BOARD THE PLAIN.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
WHAT A COINCIDENCE FOR THIS MAN,

179
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,500
WHO LEARNED HE HAD A TUMOUR ON HIS SPINE

180
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,200
YOUR PROBLME IS A LARGE TUMOUR

181
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,800
SURROUNDING ???

182
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,500
SO HE GOT THE INFORMATION ON THE SURVIVORS.

183
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,200
IS THAT HIM?

184
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,300
YES.

185
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,300
HE'S CUTE.

186
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,800
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS.

187
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,900
JACK WILL NEVER AGREE TO DO THIS SURGERY.

188
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
NO, I CAN CONVINCE HIM TO DO IT.

189
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,200
HOW?

190
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,300
SAME WAY I GET EVERYBODY TO DO ANYTHING.

191
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,200
I FIND OUT WHAT IS HIS MOTIONAL ???

192
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
AND I EXPLORE IT.

193
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,700

194
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
HE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR.

195
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,500

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
HOME.

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>JACK WAS DETERMINED
TO GET OFF THE ISLAND.</i>

331

<i>BUT JOHN LOCKE</i>

332

<i>HAD A VERY SPECIAL CONNECTION
WITH THIS PLACE...</i>

333
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
I'M LOOKING FOR
THE SUBMARINE.

334
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,000
WHAT SUBMARINE?

335
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,500
THE ONE YOU USE TO TRAVEL
TO AND FROM THE ISLAND.

336
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,500
<i>AND HE HAD NO INTENTION
OF LETTING ANYONE LEAVE.</i>

337
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
JOHN?

338
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
I'M SORRY, JACK.

339
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,700
SORRY FOR WHAT?

340
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,200
WHOA!

341
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,300
JACK AND KATE RETURNED TO CAMP.

342
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,300
AND REUNITED WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

343
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
JULIET CAME ALONG AS JACK'S GUEST.

344
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,400
BUT WASN'T A WELCOME VISITOR.

345
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
WHAT THE HELL SHE'S DOING HERE?

346
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
WHY DON'T I EVER HAVE TO EXPAIN MYSELF TO U?

347
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
U WERE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME
WHEN THAT SUBMARINE EXPLODED.

348
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,200
IN THAT MOMENT,
I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES.

349
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,600
YOU WANNA GET OFF THIS ISLAND
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

350
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,700
IN THE WORLD.
IT MAKES YOU ONE OF US.

351

HIS CONNECTION TO THE ISLAND.</i>

JUST EXCITED YOU'RE HERE.

354
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,300
- EXCITED?
- WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

355
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
SO DID YOU TELL HIM?

356
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
DID I TELL WHO WHAT?

357
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,300
DID YOU TELL THE DOC?

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,700

359
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,000
NO.

360
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,700
BUT HE KNOWS.

361
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
HE SAW US ON ONE OF
THOSE SURVEILLCE MONITORS.

362

ANYWAY, HE KNOWS.

WELL, NOW THAT
THAT'S OUT OF THE WAY,

365
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,700
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
AFTERNOON DELIGHT?

366
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,300
COME ON. FRECKLES, WAIT.
NOW HOLD...

367
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,600
DO YOU NEED ME
TO MAKE YOU A MIX TAPE?

368
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,800
YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT?

369
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,300
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
JACK'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

370

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,500
A CON MAN

LOOK,
I ONLY TOOK HER MONEY.

500
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,800
IT AIN'T MY FAULT
YOUR DAD OVERREACTED.

501

<i>THIS DEADLY ACT OF REVENGE</i>

506
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,600
YOU'D TELL ME EVERYTHING
I WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE ISLAND.

507

I'M THE LEADER
OF THIS LITTLE COMMUNITY.

509

BUT THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY TRUE.

510

WE ALL ANSWER TO SOMEONE,

511

AND WHOM MIGHT THAT BE?

512
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
HIS NAME IS JACOB.

513
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
I THINK THERE IS NO JACOB.

514
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
I THINK
YOUR PEOPLE ARE IDIOTS

515

FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

<i>IT WAS A FINAL TEST

AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SAY HELLO, JOHN?

525
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,800
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THERE'S SOMEONE THERE?

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
<i>I KNOW THERE'S SOMEONE THERE.</i>

<i>IF LOCKE WAS CAPABLE

<i>THEN HE MOST CERTAINLY WAS
A THREAT.</i>

529

I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE

I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

533
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,900
I HEARD YOU.
YOU SAID "HELP-

536

YOU'RE A FRAUD,

WERE TOLD THE TRUTH.

538
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,800
AND THIS IS NOT
THE WAY WE CAME.

539
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,200
I WANTED
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING FIRST.

THE DHARMA INITIATIVE.

541
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,400

WITH THE ISLAND'S ORIGINAL INHABITANTS,

542
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
AND WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR
THAT ONE SIDE HAD TO GO,

543
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,700
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

544
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,600
I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE
THAT WAS SMART ENOUGH

545
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,500
<i>TO MAKE SURE THAT I DIDN'T
END UP IN THAT DITCH...</i>

546
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
WHICH MAKES ME CONSIDERABLY
SMARTER THAN YOU, JOHN.

547
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,100
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

548
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,500
<i>BECAUSE YOU HEARD HIM.</i>

549
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,200
NOW I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HE SAID.

550
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
HE SAID...

551
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,800
"HELP ME."

552
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,500
<i>WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE

554
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,500
HER NAME'S PENNY.

555
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,800
THAT'S NOT BAD, DES.
NOT BAD AT ALL.

556
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,200
<i>WHEN DESMOND HUME

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,100
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU,

559
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,700
<i>BUT DESMOND LOST HIS WAY

<i>FOR A TIME.</i>

561
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,700
<i>WHEN HE WAS RELEASED,</i>

562
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,600
<i>HE ENTERED A SAILING RACE

563

<i>TO PROVE HIS WORTH
TO THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE.</i>

564
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,700
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

565
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,400
I HAVE A LOT OF MONEY,
DESMOND.

566
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
WITH ENOUGH MONEY
AND DETERMINATION,

567
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,700
YOU CAN FIND ANYONE.

568
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
I'M GONNA WIN THIS RACE,
PENNY,

569
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,800
AND IN A YEAR,
I'LL BE BACK.

570
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,900
<i>BUT DESMOND ENCOUNTERED
A STORM,</i>

571

<i>AND HIS BOAT SHIPWRECKED
ON THE ISLAND.</i>

572
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,900
<i>HE WAS TAKEN TO

<i>BUILT BY

<i>INTO A COMPUTER
EVERY 108 MINUTES.</i>

<i>BUT IT PROVIDED DESMOND

<i>TO PROVE HIMSELF A HERO.</i>

582

<i>DESMOND RELEASED
THE MAGNETIC PRESSURE</i>

583

<i>AND PREVENTED

<i>AND IN THE PROCESS...</i>

585
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,300
<i>MADE THE ISLAND VISIBLE TO

<i>SHE AND HER HUSBAND JIN
WERE UNABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN.</i>

636
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,000
<i>THIS ISSUE CAUSED GREAT STRESS
IN THEIR MARRIAGE</i>

637
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,400
<i>AND EVENTUALLY DROVE SUN
TO THE ARMS OF ANOTHER MAN.</i>

638
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,200
<i>LIFE ON THE ISLAND
BROUGHT THEM CLOSER,</i>

639
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,300
<i>AND THE SPECIAL POWER
OF THE ISLAND</i>

640
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,000
<i>GAVE THEM HOPE FOR A CHILD.</i>

641
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,800
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

642
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,500
<i>BUT A PREGNANCY ON THE ISLAND
CARRIED GREAT RISK.</i>

643
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,600
I WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH.

644
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,300
WHAT HAPPENS
TO PREGNANT WOMEN?

645
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,500
THEY ALL DIE.

646
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,700
<i>SO JULIET BROUGHT SUN
TO A DHARMA MEDICAL STATION</i>

647
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,400
<i>TO DETERMINE
THE DATE OF CONCEPTION.</i>

648
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,500
IT'S RIGHT DOWN HERE.

649
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,200
<i>IF SHE CONCEIVED
ON THE ISLAND,</i>

650
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,100
<i>SHE COULD DIE
DURING CHILDBIRTH.</i>

651
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,000
YOU GOT PREGNANT
ON THE ISLAND.

652
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,800
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY, SUN.

653
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,400
IT'S JIN'S.

654
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,400
<i>SUN WAS HAPPY,
BUT SHE WAS IN GREAT DANGER.</i>

655
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,000
<i>THE OTHERS WERE COMING
TO TAKE THE PREGNANT WOMEN,</i>

656
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,700
<i>AND SHE WAS A TARGET,</i>

657
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,500
<i>SO JACK REVEALED HIS PLAN
FOR AN AMBUSH.</i>

658
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
HIDING'S POINTLESS.

659
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
THEY'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
COMING BACK.

660
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,200
SO I WENT OUT
AND I FOUND SOME HELP.

661
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,600
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME,
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT,

662
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,900
WHEN THEY'RE COMING TO GET IT,
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

663
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,900
SO TOMORROW NIGH
WE STOP LIVING IN FEAR OF THEM,

664
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,300
BECAUSE WHEN THEY SHOW UP...

665
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
WE'RE GONNA BLOW 'EM ALL
TO HELL.

666
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,100
<i>A CONFRONTATION WAS IMMINENT.</i>

667
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,300
IF YOU LEAVE RIGHT NOW,

668
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,100
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU
TO REACH THEIR CAMP?

669
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,600
IF I TAKE MY TEN BEST,

670
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
WE CAN S UP TO HIT 'EM
BY NIGHTFALL.

671
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,000
- THEN YOU BETTER GET GOING.
- JULIET MAY NOT BE READY.

672
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,300
- WHAT IF SHE HASN'T HAD TIME TO IDENTIFY-
- THEN WE'LL TAKE ALLTHEIR WOMEN.

673
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,100
IF ANY OF 'EM ARE STUPID ENOUGH
TO GET IN YOUR WAY,

674
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
KILL 'EM.

675
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>A PLAN FOR RESCUE WAS HASTENED.</i>

676
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,200
WHATEVER
THAT INTERFERENCE IS,

677
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,300
IT'S BLOCKING OUR ABILITY
TO SEND OUR OWN TRANSMISSION.

678
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,200
BEN IS USING ONE
OF THE DHARMA STATIONS

679
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
TO BLOCK ALL OF THE SIGNALS OFF
OF THE ISLAND EXCEPT FOR OURS.

680
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,400
WHAT STATION?

681
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,700
THEY CALL IT
"THE LOOKING GLASS."

682
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,200
BEN TOLD US THAT THE STATION
WAS COMPLETELY FLOODED.

683
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
I THINK I'LL BE ABLE
TO FIND THE RELAY SWITCH

684
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
AND DISABLE IT.

685
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,200
NO, I'M NOT LETTING YOU
GO ON SOME SUICIDE MISSION

686
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,300
JUST TO FLIP THE SWITCH.

687
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,500
WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO DO IT,

688
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
OR WE'LL NEVER LEAVE
THIS ISLAND.

689
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,600
I'LL DO IT.

690
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>CHARLIE ALREADY KNEW
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE.</i>

691
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,100
<i>DESMOND HAD A VISION
THAT TOLD HIM WHY.</i>

692
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>YOU'RE INSIDE A HATCH.</i>

693
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,700
<i>THERE'S
A BLINKING YELLOW LIGHT.</i>

694
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,600
YOU FLICK THE SWITCH,
THE LIGHT GOES OFF,

695
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,200
AND THEN YOU DROWN.

696
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,000
<i>IF YOU DON'T,
THERE WON'T BE ANY RESCUE.</i>

697
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,700
THIS TIME, YOU HAVE TO DIE.

698
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
IT'S DANGEROUS, ISN'T IT?

699
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,300
IT'S WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
TO GET US ALL RESCUED.

700
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,000
I'LL BE FINE, CLAIRE.

701
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,800
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

702
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,900
<i>CHARLIE WAS WILLING
TO SACRIFICE HIS LIFE</i>

703

<i>TO SAVE CLAIRE
AND HIS FRIENDS.</i>

704

<i>AND WHEN HE DOVE DOWN DEEP
BENEATH THE OCEAN,</i>

GOOD. GOOD.

FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER.

752

WHY WERE THERE
ONLY TWO EXPLOSIONS?

753
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,600
IT DIDN'T WORK.

754
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,400

OKAY?

758
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,600
WHAT?!

759
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800

WHAT GOOD NEWS?

763
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
WE CAUGHT THREE OF 'EM--

764
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,000
THE ONES WHO STAYED BEHIND
TO BLOW UP THE TENTS.

765

What do you want us to do?

766
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,700
KILL 'EM?

767
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,700
NO. NOT YET.

768
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,500
CHARLIE! BLOODY HELL.

769
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,500
YOU ALL RIGHT?

770
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
NOT FOR LONG IF YOU
DON'T GET OUT OF HERE.

771
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,500
YOU HAVE TO HIDE, DES. HIDE,
HIDE. THERE'S PEOPLE IN THERE.

772
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
I'M GOING BACK TO THE BEACH.

773
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,200
NO WAY. WE KEEP MOVING.

774
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,700
I AIN'T ASKING PERMISSION.

775
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET DONE,

776
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
ALONE AND UNARMED?

777
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,400
HE WON'T BE ALONE.
I'LL GO WITH HIM.

778
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,600
NO.

779
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
I KNOW WHERE THERE ARE
SOME GUNS.

780
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,900
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
YEAH, JACK, I KINDA DO.

781
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,500
DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

782
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,800
I WON'T IF YOU WON'T.

783
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

784
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
EVERYTHING I DID,
I DID FOR THE ISLAND.

785
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,700
I need you to help me clean up
this mess that I've made.

786
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,800
I NEED YOU TO KILL CHARLIE.

787
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,400
Make sure that
the jamming mechanism

788
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,500
continues to function
at all costs.

789
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,400
HEY, GUYS, WAIT UP!
I'M COMING WITH YOU GUYS.

790
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,100
NO WAY. NOT A CHANCE.

791
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
I JUST WANNA HELP. PLEASE?

792
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,900
FOR GOD SAKES, HUGO,
LOOK AT YOU.

793
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,800
YORE JUST GONNA GET
IN THE WAY.

794
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,600
YOU WANNA GET US KILLED?

795
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,600
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT,
YOU KNOW--SAWYER.

796
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,800
WHEN HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO GO WITH HIM,

797
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,600
HE DIDN'T ME IT.

798
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,700
IF HE DIDN'T MEAN IT,
WHY DID HE SAY IT?

799
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,500
HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

800
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
HEY. 

801
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,200
WHY ARE YOU
STICKING UP FOR SAWYER?

802
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,400
HE'D NEVER DO IT FOR YOU.

803
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,300
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

804
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,600
HELLO, JACK.

805
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,700
WE NEED TO TALK.

806
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,500
THE WOMAN
YOU'RE TRAVELING WITH--

807
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,100
SHE'S NOT
WHO SHE SAYS SHE IS.

808
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,700
THEN WHO IS SHE?

809
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,500
SHE'S A REPRESENTATIVE
OF SOME PEOPLE

810
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
FIND THIS ISLAND, JACK.

811
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,600
IF YOU PHONE HER BOAT,

812
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,000
EVERY SINGLE LIVING PERSON
ON THIS ISLAND

813
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
WILL BE KILLED.

814
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,300
GET THAT DEVICE--

815
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,600
THE PHONE SHE CARRIES WITH HER--

816
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
AND GIVE IT TO ME.

817
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,700
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

818
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,900
YOUR PLAN KILLED
SEVEN OF MY PEOPLE,

819
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,700
BUT THE ONES THAT YOU FAILED TO
KILL ARE NOW HOLDING YOUR FRIENDS--

820
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
JIN, SAYID, BERNARD--

821
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,700
AT GUNPOINT.

822
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,100
Tom, unless you hear
my voice in one minute,

823
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,000
shoot all three of them.

824
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,200
NO. I'M GETTING THEM ALL
OFF THE ISLAND--ALL OF 'EM!

825
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,700
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING, JACK.

826
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,200
WHY DO YOU WANNA
LEAVE THE ISLAND? 

827
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,400
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU SO
DESPERATELY WANNA GET BACK TO? 

828
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,800
YOUR FATHER'S DEAD.
YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU,

829
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,500
MOVED ON WITH ANOTHER MAN.

830
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,900
CAN YOU JUST NOT WAIT
TO GET BK TO THE HOSPITAL?

831
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,800
GET BACK TO FIXING THINGS?

832
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,200
JUST GET ME THE PHONE, JACK.

833
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,100
- NO.
- TEN SECONDS.

834
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,400
- BRING ME THE PHONE.
- NO.

835
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,800
- I'M NOT BLUFFING.
- I WON'T DO IT!

836
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,100
FIVE... FOUR... THREE...

837
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,500
NO.</i>

838
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,900
I'M SO SORRY, JACK.

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,900
BEN DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

840
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,500
HE'S LOST IT. 

841
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,400
I MEAN, LOOK AT WHAT THEY DID TO US.

842
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,000
INSTEAD OF PUTTING THREE BULLETS
IN THE DAMN SAND,

843
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,200
WE SHOULD'VE KILLED THEM
FOR REAL.

844
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
UHH! AAH!

845
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,900
Attention, Others.
Come in, Others.

846
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,400
HURLEY?

847
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,300
DUDE, I'M BACK AT THE BEACH.

848
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,200
I SAVED 'EM.

849
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,300
THEY'RE OKAY? JULIET--
Everyone's fine--

850
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,300
JULIET, SAYID, JIN, BERNARD.
YEAH, DUDE.

851
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I TOLD YOU, I SAVED 'EM ALL.

852
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,700
WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?
DID HE MAKE IT BACYET?

853
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,700
DON'T WORRY.
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

854
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,400
WITH DESMOND'S HELP, CHARLIE ESCAPED
HIS CAORS IN THE LOOKING GLASS</i>

855
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,100
AND COMPLETED HIS MISSION,</i>

856
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,000
GIVING HIS FRIENDS A CHANCE</i>
TO CONTACT THE FREIGHTER.</i>

857
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
INCOMING TRANSMISSION?

858
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,800
Can you hear me?</i>

859
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,100
YES. YES, I CAN HEAR YOU!

860
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,800
This is Penelope--</i>
Penelope Widmore.</i>

861
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,900
How did you get</i>
this frequency?</i>

862
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,400
DESMOND?!

863
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,400
Did you just say "Desmond"?</i>

864
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,700
YEAH. HE'S HERE.
HE'S WITH ME.

865
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,800
Is he okay?</i>

866
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,200
HE'S BRILLIANT! HEY, 

867
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,100
- ARE YOU ON E BOAT?
- What? What boat?</i>

868
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,300
UH, N-NAOMI,
THE PARACHUTIST.

869
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,900
I'm not on a boat.</i>
Who's Naomi?</i>

870
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,200
Is Desmond there?</i>

871
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,800
CHARLIE!

872
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,600
Not Pennys BOAT ???

873
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,600
SHH, HEY, AARON.

874
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,200
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

875
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
WHAT IS IT?

876
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,700
WHAT'S YOUR BOYFRIEND'S NAME--

877
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
THE ROCK STAR WHO SWAM
DOWN TO THE STATION?

878
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,800
CHARLIE.

879
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,900
CHARLIE JUST GOT US RESCUED.

880
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,500
JACK! JACK, HE DID IT!

881
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,100
YOUR FRIEND
BLOODY WELL DID IT.

882
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,200
WHAT?

883
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,900
THE GREEN LIGHT--IT'S ON.
THE JAMMING STOPPED.

884
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,200
THE AIRWAVES WERE NOW OPEN,</i>

885
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,800
AND THE SURVIVORS</i>
MADE THE CALL FOR HELP.</i>

886
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
I'VE GOT IT!
I'VE GOT A SIGNAL!

887
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
THIS WILL BE
YOUR LAST CHANCE, JACK.

888
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,200
I'M TELLING YOU,
MAKING THAT CALL

889
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,600
IS THE BEGINNING
OF THE END.

890
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,400
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

891
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,700
AAH!

892
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,400
WHAT DID YOU DO?

893
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,100
WHAT I HAD TO.
NOW STEP BACK.

894
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
UHH!

895
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,100
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

896
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,700
NO. 

897
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,800
YOU'RE DONE
KEEPING ME ON THIS ISLAND.

898
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DO THIS.

899
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,700
Hello?

900
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,700
WHO IS THIS?

901
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Who is this?</i>

902
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,800
I'M ONE OF THE SURVIVORS
OF OCEANIC FLIGHT 815.

903
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
CAN YOU GET A FIX
ON OUR LOCATION?

904
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,400
Hell, yeah, we can.
Sit tight.

905
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,000
RESCUE...</i>

906
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,200
THE MOMENT THEY NEVER DREAMED</i>
WOULD COME.</i>

907
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,400
But ???

908
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,300
THAT COULD FREE THEM</i>
FROM THEIR PAST</i>

909
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,300
WITHOUT TRULY KNOWING</i>
WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD HOLD?</i>

910
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,200
Hello?
IT'S ME.

911
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,000
WHOA, WHOA. WAIT.
DON'T--DON'T HANG UP.

912
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,200
PLEASE.

913
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,100
I JUST NEED TO SEE YOU.

914
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,900
PLEASE.

915
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,600
YEAH.

916
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
YEAH, OUT AT THE AIRPORT.

917
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,000
YOU KNOW WHERE.

918
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,500
- HEY.
- HEY.

919
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,300
WHY DID YOU CALL ME, JACK?

920
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,700
I'VE BEEN FLYING A LOT.

921
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,500
WHAT?

922
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT, I...

923
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,200
I FLY FROM L.A. TO TOKYO
OR... 

924
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,700
SINGAPORE OR SYDNEY.

925
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,400
WHY?

926
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,000
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO CRASH, KATE.

927
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,500
I ACTUALLY CLOSE MY EYES,

928
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
AND I PRAY
THAT I CAN GET BACK.

929
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,000
THIS IS NOT GONNA CHANGE.

930
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,700
NO, I'M SICK...</i>

931
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,600
OF LYING.

932
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,400
WE MADE A MISTAKE.

933
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,200
I HAVE TO GO.

934
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,300
WE... WERE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE.

935
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
YES, WE WERE.

936
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,000
WE HAVE TO GO BACK, KATE.

937
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,100
WE HAVE TO GO BACK!

938
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,100
