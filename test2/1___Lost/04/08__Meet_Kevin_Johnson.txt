1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,060
Previously on Lost

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,250
-We're gonna have to take the boy.  -Dad!

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,880
Walt!
Walt!

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,250
No!

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,740
I'm going after my son.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,870
I'm going after my son,

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,240
And nobody is gonna stop me.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,210
We need him!

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,650
One of our people was captured by yours.

10
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,050
-So go get'em back.  -We can't do that, but you can.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,520
And if you do, we'll let you and walt go free.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll do it. Give me the gun.

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,060
I'll kill him.

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,570
Michael?
Michael?

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,740
You lived up to your word.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,910
We live up to our word, too.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,510
You're gonna take this boat

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,380
And follow a compass bearing of 3-2-5,

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,350
And if you do that exactly,

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,360
You and your son will find rescue.

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,320
Who are you people?

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,260
We're the good guys, Michael.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,130
-Walt!  -Dad!
-Walt!  -dad!

24
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,770
Come here! come here!

25
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,630
Thank you all for your patience.

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,930
I know it's taken me a few days to...

27
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,760
Figure out our next move, but I don't want to do anything

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,870
until I knew more about our situation.

29
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,830
You deserve to know everything that I do,

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,300
So... no more secrets.

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,340
As you all know,

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,240
Miles here and three of his people

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,410
Came to the island about a week ago.

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,550
So I brought him up from the boathouse

35
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,150
To share with us

36
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,350
Exactly why they're here.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,760
We're here for him.

38
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,400
Um, we kind of, like, knew that forever ago.

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,330
Well, all right then.

40
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,470
Problem solved.How soon do we turn him over?  -we can't turn him over.

41
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,710
-And why the hell not?  -Because once they have me,

42
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,710
Their orders are to kill everyone else on the island.

43
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,450
Wait. so...what, he's one of us now?

44
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,890
You're--you're gonna protect him? He tried to kill you, john.

45
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,560
Yeah. He won't even tell us who his spy on the boat is.

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,420
It's michael.

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,990
What?

48
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,660
My spy on the freighter is Michael.

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,100
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,780
You mean the same guy that killed two women in cold blood

51
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,740
To set this little bastard free?

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,110
And then sold all of us out so he could get off the island

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,410
-That michael?  -Yes, james.

54
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,350
That Michael.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,740
The rules of desertion...

56
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,010
Still apply to everyone.

57
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,650
Nobody leaves this ship without my say-so!

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,350
I'm not beating these men to scare you.

59
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,320
I beat them to save your lives!

60
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,460
Do you remember what happened to the last two men

61
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,030
Who took off in is boat?

62
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,200
You remember what happened to minkowski?

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,330
As soon as we get the engines fixed,

64
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,400
We're back in the hunt.

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,470
In the meantime,

66
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,270
Everybody just hold on.

67
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,680
Johnson!
Johnson!

68
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,210
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,520
Clean this mess up.

70
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,950
Sir.

71
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,300
Hello, michael.

72
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,930
-Not now, man.  -Yes,right now.

73
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,840
Why are you on this boat?

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,510
I'm here to die.

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,530
That was a nice meetin', John,

76
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,850
But I thought there wasn't gonna be any more secrets.

77
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,710
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm talking about the 3 million bucks

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,490
Your buddy here asked for.

80
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,800
Yeah.

81
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Miles offered his loyalty in exchange for the money.

82
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,800
But as I haven't seen a bank on the island,

83
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,300
I didn't think it worth mentioning.

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,250
Somethin' funny?

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,970
Linus will find a way to get it.

86
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,690
And how will he do that?

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,460
He wants to survive.

88
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,690
And considering a week ago you had a gun to his head,

89
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,770
And tonight he's eating pound cake...

90
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,760
I'd say he's a guy who gets what he wants.

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,780
It's fine. Okay, thanks.

92
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,010
Bye, guys.

93
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,770
Alex?
Alex?

94
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,530
May I have a word with you?

95
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,900
I think we've heard enough from you for one night.

96
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,910
I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to listen to a little more.

97
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,540
It's okay. What do you want?

98
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,880
This is a map to the temple.

99
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,160
It's a sanctuary.

100
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,570
It may be the last safe place on this island.

101
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,280
How can we don't know about this?

102
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,690
Well, it wouldn't be a sanctuary if I told everyone, would it?

103
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,870
The rest of our people are already there.

104
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,960
If you leave now, you can get there in a day and a half.

105
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,010
If it's safe, why don't we all go--Hurley, Claire, the baby?

106
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,680
Because the temple's

107
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,090
Not for them, Karl. It's only for us.

108
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,450
These people that are coming-- they know who I am, Alex.

109
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,670
They're here to capture me.

110
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,450
They'll kill anybody that get in their way.

111
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,630
If they knew who you were, that you were my daughter,

112
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,220
They would use you to get to me.

113
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,500
We don't have much time.

114
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,310
Maybe he's right.

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,260
I agree.

116
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,550
We should go.

117
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,110
These people-- you said they're dangerous.

118
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,430
More dangerous than you?

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,190
Yes.

120
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,460
But your mother will protect you.

121
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,310
Okay, now go.

122
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,970
Where is he?

123
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,050
-You sure? -Yeah.

124
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,410
He's in the engine room.

125
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,200
I don'understand it. It should be working.

126
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,720
Gaskets are all corroded.

127
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,110
Can I help you?

128
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,290
The captain sent us down to help with the repairs

129
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,780
Oh, thanks. We're okay.

130
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,080
Hey, Jeff, man, you know what?

131
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,050
We need a pressure valve. you mind grabbing one

132
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,720
-From the, uh, supply room?  -Not at all.

133
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,390
You shouldn't be here.

134
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,540
-Oh, Sayid, what are you doing? -Why are you here?

135
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,730
-If they see me talking to you-- -Then talk quickly.

136
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,230
You won't understand it! I'll understand perfectly, Michael.

137
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,510
You just start from the beginning

138
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,780
And explain how you came to be on this boat.

139
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you, mr. dawson.

140
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,040
It's...

141
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,220
What happened to me?

142
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,080
You were in a car accident. it's a miracle you're alive.

143
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,670
How badly am I hurt?

144
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,160
Shh. you just need to rest now.

145
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,120
It's a cold night.

146
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,070
I brought you some extra blankets.

147
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,670
Ugh. let's get some light in here.

148
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,180
Now I thought I heard someone shout,

149
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,270
and something tells me it wasn't him.

150
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,100
You okay?

151
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,360
You're lucky to be alive.

152
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,180
E.m.t.s say they found you in a wrecked car

153
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,100
There's a note pinnedo your chest.

154
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,800
You didn't have any i.d. on you.

155
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,120
you Want to tell me your name?

156
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,620
Yeah, I didn't think so.

157
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,250
You want me to call walt?

158
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,200
What?

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,930
The note pinned to your chest.

160
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,110
It was written to "walt." you want me to call him?

161
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,830
No.

162
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,090
Okay, then.

163
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,100
Hey, ma.

164
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,190
Can i... come in?

165
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,600
No. you know the answer to that.

166
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,380
I wanna see him. no.

167
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,650
Just let me talk-- I don't know what you said to that boy,

168
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880
But whatever it was, he doesn't want to see you.

169
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,150
Please, ma. he's my son. I have a right

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,510
He thought you were dead.

171
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,640
They said your plane crashed in the middle of the ocean,

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,460
But you show up here fine and dandy,

173
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,280
Only I can't tell anybody but you or walt,

174
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,230
I can't call you by your real names.

175
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,500
He barely talks to me,

176
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,540
But he does wake up screamin' in the middle of the night,

177
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,170
And I'm the one who got to tell him

178
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,530
It's gonna be okay.

179
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,990
So until you can explain to me

180
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,720
Where you were for over two months

181
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,260
And what happened...

182
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,260
You gave up your rights.

183
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,170
Will you, uh...

184
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,120
Will you tell him I love him?

185
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,610
Yeah.

186
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,340
What can I do for ya?

187
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,110
How much can I get for that?

188
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,600
Why is there chinese writing all over it?

189
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,140
It's korean,an-- the guy who gave it to me.

190
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,550
You don't look like you speak korean.

191
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,720
I'll give you $300 for it. I'm not looking for money.

192
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,140
What are you looking for?

193
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,050
I want a gun. I want a gun with bullets.

194
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,120
Come on. let's just get this done.

195
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,320
Help me just get this done.

196
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,360
Excuse me, sir. you got the time?

197
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,360
No, man. no.

198
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,990
Come on, michael.

199
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
How about for an old friend?

200
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,300
Manhattan, huh?

201
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,080
We let you leave one island, you just go to another one.

202
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,600
Will you just relax? I just came here to

203
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,480
Now are u ready to talk like adults?

204
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,370
Yeah.

205
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,060
Enough!

206
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,650
Do it. go ahead, do it!

207
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,340
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

208
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,620
How do you find me?

209
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,840
We are the ones who sent you home, michael.

210
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,930
Did you honestly think we weren't gonna keep tabs?

211
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,850
What do you want?

212
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,320
Your help.

213
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,490
Why would I help the son of a bitch

214
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,850
Who kidnapped my son?

215
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,790
We gave him back to you in one piece, mike.

216
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,150
You're the one who lost him.

217
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,260
You told him, didn't you?

218
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,940
You couldn't carry the guilt

219
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
Of what you did to those two women all by yourself,

220
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,990
So you shared it with a 10-year-old kid.

221
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,490
Is that why you wanna kill yourself, micel?

222
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,890
Because that's the way he looks at you now?

223
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,300
Because he knows you're a murderer? go away!

224
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,710
I got some bad news for you, amigo.

225
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,210
You can't kill yourself. the island won't let you!

226
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,150
What'd you say?

227
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,970
No matter how bad you want to,

228
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
No matter how many different ways y try,

229
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,020
It won happen.

230
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,510
Give it a shot if you don't belie me.

231
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,190
You got more work to do, mike.

232
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,730
When you figure that out,

233
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,460
I'm in the penthse at the hotel earle.

234
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,960
The wreckage of oceanic flight 815

235
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,830
Has them found.

236
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,570
This footage confirms

237
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,890
The airplane did, in fact, crash at sea.

238
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,930
At these tremendous depths,

239
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,290
There is little hope of recovering any remains.

240
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,750
Investigators are equally skeptical

241
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,920
About the chances of retrieving

242
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,380
Oceanic 815's black box.

243
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,190
The real story behind

244
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,140
What happened to this fateful airliner

245
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:32,370
May have been lost along with the 324 passengers onboard.

246
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,240
But even with this tragic discovery,

247
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,460
The victims' families were hoping today...

248
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,460
I didn't expect you that fast.

249
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,110
Is this the guy who hit you with the champagne bottle?

250
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,430
Yeah, but I had it coming.

251
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,520
Arturo, michael and I have some business to attend to.

252
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,580
Would you get some air? of course.

253
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,290
Ciao.

254
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,710
Help yourself to the chow.

255
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,020
Don't make it to the mainland too often...

256
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,660
So when I do, I like to indulge myself.

257
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,380
So you people can just... come and go?

258
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,610
Some of us. you want a drink?

259
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,770
What I want is for you to tell me

260
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,820
What my plane is doing at the bottom of the ocean.

261
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,670
That's not your plane. it's a phony.

262
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,030
A man named Widmore put it down there,

263
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,890
And he staged the whole wreck.

264
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,480
Staged? why would he stage a--

265
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,160
Because he doesn't want anyone else finding

266
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,320
Where the real plane ended up... except for him.

267
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm supposed to believe this?

268
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,710
Did the bullet bounce off your skull,

269
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,890
Or did the gun just jam on you?

270
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,060
Prove it.

271
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,670
Sorry?

272
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:07,030
Prove that this guy, Widmore, did what you say he did.

273
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,030
Prove it.

274
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,490
That's the cemetery in Thailand

275
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,760
Where Widmore dug up the 300-odd corpses he needed.

276
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,670
And the purchase order for the old 777

277
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,350
Bought through a shell company,

278
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,080
And the shipping logs for the freighter he used

279
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,900
To drop the whole mess down a trench deep enough

280
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,080
To guarantee that no remains are ever gonna be identified.

281
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,010
Do you have any idea what it would cost

282
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,460
To bring those bodies up?

283
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,190
What you want from me, man?

284
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,820
In a few days,

285
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,360
A freighter is porting in fiji.

286
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,040
It's widmore's boat.

287
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,160
We have reason to believe he's finally found

288
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,570
The coordinates of the island, and he's heading right for it.

289
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,060
So congratulations, michael. your shore leave is over.

290
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,280
You just got a job on that boat.

291
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,870
Meet Kevin Johnson.

292
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,230
You're joining the crew in fiji as a deckhand.

293
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,570
You want me to go unrcover?

294
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,150
Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?

295
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,600
Because if widmore finds the island,

296
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,020
It's good night for everybody on it.

297
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,190
He'll kill them all without thinking twice.

298
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,040
You wanna redeem yourself for what you did?

299
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,770
This is your only chance.

300
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,730
You can save all their lives.

301
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,980
No. I can't. I can't go back to that island.

302
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,980
I didn't say you were going back to the island.

303
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,610
You're going on that boat so you can swab decks, michael.

304
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,600
You're going so you can kill everyone onboard.

305
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,290
Hey.

306
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,740
You are engineer?

307
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,290
Nah.

308
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,020
Just a deckhand.

309
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,300
Well, we're all equals on this boat...

310
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,970
As long as you play decent hold'em.

311
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,840
I'm George... Minkowsk

312
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,640
Kevin Johnson
Kevin johnson.

313
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,180
Ah, nice to meet you, Kevin.

314
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,500
All right, well, why don't you go check in

315
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,840
With Naomi over there? and, uh I'll be seeing you? welcome.

316
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,760
I'm reporting for duty. Kevin Johnson.

317
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,530
Naomi Dorrit. pleasure.

318
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,020
So you're from the states, yeah?

319
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,170
New york.

320
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,660
Yeah, I could tell from the accent. Manchester?

321
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,890
How'd you guess? You can head onboard.

322
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,660
Oh, uh, one of these crates was delivered for you.

323
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,570
I'll have it divered to your berth?

324
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,340
Yeah. thanks.

325
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,080
Welcome aboard, Kevin.

326
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,680
Your name isn't Kevin.

327
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,580
Don't worry.

328
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,390
80% of the people on this boat are lying about something.

329
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,130
Orange?

330
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,850
No, thanks.

331
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,240
Yeah? how was your trip?

332
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,610
I figure flying can't be too much fun for you.

333
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,800
What do you want?

334
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,480
You get your care package?

335
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,810
Yeah. wait a day or two until

336
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You're out in the open sea, then you're good to go.

337
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,360
You can stow your gear downstairs, all right?

338
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,490
Welcome aboard, keamy.

339
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,340
Oh, you met some of 'em now.

340
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,160
Got some names and faces,

341
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,710
And you're gettin' cold feet, huh? yeah, actually, I am.

342
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,710
Listen, here are a few more names for ya--

343
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,340
Sun  Sawyer  Jack
Sun, sawyer, jack,

344
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,890
Claire, her baby.

345
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,790
And the only way you're gonna save their lives

346
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,330
Is if you man up and get on that boat.

347
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,920
Or maybe you wanna come back and explain to your kid

348
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
How you let all of them die, too.

349
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,820
It's game time. are you in or out?

350
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,350
I'm in.

351
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,470
Then ditch your phone and go do your job.

352
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,760
No offense but I was flying these things

353
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,180
When you were still in grade chool.

354
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,640
If anybody's gotta go first, it should be me. Yeah, I need you get

355
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,360
Transport the science team, Frank. what the hell are you gonna be doing?

356
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,450
That's need-to-know. you don't.

357
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,680
So much for the fairer sex, huh?

358
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,360
Frank Lapidus, chopper pilot.

359
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,110
Kevin Joson
Kevin joson.

360
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,390
Deckhand.

361
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,830
So what's your story, Kevin?

362
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,290
Sorry?

363
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,750
How'd you end up on this tub?

364
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,360
Looking for a little adventure.

365
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,500
Ah, adventure.

366
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,560
Yeah.

367
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,590
Well, how do you like this for adventure?

368
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,770
You ever hear about oceanic 815?

369
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:41,780
Yeah.

370
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,560
What would you say if I told you

371
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,520
The plane they found in that trench

372
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,800
Wasn't oceanic 815?

373
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,550
Then what is it?

374
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,220
You know those nuts that think the moon landing was faked?

375
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,180
Well, this is like that...

376
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,400
Only real.

377
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,090
That's why I signed up for this trip,

378
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,900
Because the owner of this boat believes me.

379
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,320
Charles Widmore
Charles widmore.

380
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,460
He believes that 815 is still out there somewhere.

381
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,350
I mean, can you imagine what would happen...

382
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,570
If we'd found some of those people alive?

383
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,520
Pull

384
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,970
Pull!

385
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,580
Another clip. good job.

386
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,520
Pull!

387
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,690
Kill shot! yeah!

388
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,490
What are you guys doing?

389
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,490
What are you guys doing?

390
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,760
What's it look like we're doing?

391
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,910
We're shooting things

392
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,000
Pull!

393
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,630
I, uh...

394
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,910
Thought we were going on a rescue mission.

395
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,380
Don't you have something to mop up?

396
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,830
Come on. let's go.

397
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,190
Pull!

398
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,560
You can do this, man. you can do this.

399
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,430
7... 1...
7... 1...

400
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,930
7-7-6
7-7-6.

401
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,650
Okay.

402
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,510
Don't do it, michael.

403
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,620
I love you, Walt.

404
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,360
What, are you going Nicholson on us?

405
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,130
What? you know, Jack Nicholson in "the shining,"

406
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,540
When he's bouncing that ball against the wall?

407
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,270
Next thing you know,

408
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,230
You're gonna go after your wife with an ax.

409
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,360
I'm not married, man.

410
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,350
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you got a call.

411
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,530
A call?

412
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,170
Yeah. from the mainland.

413
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,850
They patched it through to the radio room.

414
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,670
It's gotta be a mistake, man. nobody even knows I'm here.

415
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,470
Well, you're the only Kevin Johnson onboard,

416
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,380
So somebody knows you're here.

417
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,290
Said he really needs to talk to you. his name's Walt.

418
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,250
Yeah, here you go. hey, uh...

419
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,020
It's kind of personal. mind if I take this alone?

420
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,390
Take your time, Kev.

421
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,890
You just push this yellow button

422
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,840
And, uh, turn this knob on the console. got it.

423
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,710
Okay.

424
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,610
Walt?
Walt?

425
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,020
I'm so sorry, Michael, but he's still in new york.

426
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,790
So I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

427
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,260
Michael
Michael?

428
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,400
Are you still there?

429
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,390
You put me on this boat,

430
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,890
Talked me into blowing it up,

431
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,450
And when I push the damn button,

432
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,990
A flag pops up.

433
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,350
You actually activated the bomb?

434
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,450
It's not a bomb! it's a...

435
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,010
It's a joke.

436
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,460
There are people on your boat who are innocent.

437
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,230
They have no idea

438
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,100
That the man they work for is a monster,

439
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,910
A killer without conscience wouldn't get a greater purpose.

440
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,410
I had to show you the difference between him and me.

441
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,460
When I'm at war, I'll do what I need to do to win,

442
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,510
But I will not kill innocent people.

443
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,060
Ana Lucia and Libby...

444
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,960
They were innocent.

445
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,000
You killed them, Michael.

446
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,910
No one asked you to.

447
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,090
I don't blame you, Michael.

448
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,820
We did you have your boy.

449
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,000
And what wouldn'a man do for his son?

450
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,130
What do you want... from me?

451
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,800
I want you to compile a list of names...

452
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,940
Every person on your boat.

453
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,440
When I call again, you'll give me that list.

454
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,900
Then you will disable

455
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,760
The radio room you're sitting in.

456
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,670
When the crew is disiented by their lack of communication,

457
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,440
You'll take out the engines, too.

458
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,710
That way, the boat can never get to this island,

459
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,380
And your friends will be safe.

460
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,450
Will you do that for me, Michael?

461
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,210
Yeah.

462
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,240
Then consider yourself one of the good guys.

463
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,710
So you're telling me...

464
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,210
That you're working for Benjamin Linus?

465
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,160
Yeah.

466
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

467
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,250
Hey, Sayid.

468
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,070
Guys!

469
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,810
Hold it! uhh!

470
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,560
Let me go! what are you doing?!

471
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,650
Shut your mouth

472
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,840
What the hell is this?

473
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,590
This man is not who you think he is.

474
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,410
He was a passenger onceanic flight 8-1-5.

475
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:44,590
I spent two months with him on the island

476
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,780
Before he betrayed us.

477
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,190
This is the man who sabotaged your radio room.

478
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,100
He destroyed the ship's engine,

479
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,510
And his name isn't Ken Johnson.

480
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,230
It's michael dawson,

481
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,640
And he's a traitor.

482
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,690
Stop here and drink.

483
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,190
Two minutes, then we keep moving.

484
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,110
What's wrong?

485
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,510
Nothing.

486
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,280
Karl
Karl.

487
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,470
I don't know.

488
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,190
I just he a bad feeling about this.

489
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,000
What if your dad is... playing us?

490
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,690
Look, I don't like taking orders from my dad

491
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,190
Any more than you do.

492
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,370
But I know he doesn' want me to get hurt.

493
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,230
Well, at least we've got something in common.

494
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,230
