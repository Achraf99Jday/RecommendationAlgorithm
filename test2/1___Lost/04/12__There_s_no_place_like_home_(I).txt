1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,470
what is that?

3
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:03,860
The secondary protocol.

4
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,630
What does it say?

5
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,470
If linus knows that we're
gonna torch the island,

6
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,770
there's only one
place that he can go.

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,000
What do you
mean,"torch the island"?

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,040
go and gas up the chopper,frank.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,290
I think they want us to follow 'em.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,400
Are you jacob?

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,300
No,but i can speak on his behalf.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,350
Did he tell you what
we're supsed to do?

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,660
He wants us to move the island.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,490
We got a little chop ahead.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,300
Put that away,man.

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,330
You're freaking me out.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,690
We need this thing.

18
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,880
With the cargo we got back there?

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,390
Bad mojo.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,290
Ms. Decker?

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,080
Yes?

22
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,090
Wanna head back there and
let 'em know we're landing?

23
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,250
Sure.Of course.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,770
we're coming in for a landing.

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:33,310
It's a military facility
just west of honolulu.

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,590
It's completely private.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,550
Your...your families
are already here.

28
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,220
Now there's a lot of press
that wanna speak to you,

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,590
but as far as oceanic is concerned,

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,300
you don't have to
speak to any reporters.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,340
Wel talk to 'em.

32
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,660
Is that all right with all of you?

33
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,730
It's fine.

34
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,870
We all agreed.

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,020
We just...we just
wanna get it over with.

36
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,090
Okay.

37
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,430
Um,they're referring to
you as the "oceanic six."

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,360
That's not the best branding as far
as we're concerned,but it's catchy.

39
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,930
We'll see you on the ground.

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,700
we all know the story.

41
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,760
If we get any questions that we don't
wanna answer,or that we can't answer,

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,410
let's just keep our mouths shut.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,270
It's okay.They'll...

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,090
they'll think that we're in shock.

45
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,550
We are in shock,jack.

46
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,510
Well...

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,860
then this should be easy.

48
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,030
it was sayid and...and desmond
in the helicopter,right?

49
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,540
I mean,it had to be.

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,500
Why else would they have dropped
that thingamabob right over us?

51
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,440
then why wouldn't they just land?

52
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,670
I don't know,but this thing
is trackin' the chopper.

53
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,050
So if they were on it, they want
us to know we're they're going.

54
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,460
it's a phone,right?

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,940
Can't we just call?

56
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,280
Well?

57
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,580
Don't try anything stupid.

58
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,920
Understood.

59
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,590
- put it down over there.
- is that from the chopper?

60
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,700
we're still 5 klicks from the site.

61
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,550
I said put it down,frank.

62
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,660
Okay,gear up,boys.

63
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,610
Soon as we hit the ground,
we deploy to the orchid.

64
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,040
Heads down!

65
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's do this.

66
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,010
you know what "the orchid" is?

67
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,760
No.

68
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,310
I didn't hear desmond
or sayid either.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,290
Kate.

70
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,320
wanna take a walk?

71
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,450
Absolutely.

72
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,300
I'll get the guns.

73
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,920
- You get some water,okay?
- Okay.

74
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,300
You can't possibly be serious.

75
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,480
- You just had surgery,jack.
- I'm gonna be fine.

76
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,080
If your sutures rip,
you're not gonna be fine.

77
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,130
I can't just sit around waiting.

78
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,070
Recovery is not "sitting around"!

79
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,230
- Look,I have to do this.
- Why?

80
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,280
Because I promised those people
that I would get 'em off this island.

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,400
don't bleed to death,jack.

82
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,500
I'll see ya in a couple hours.

83
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,180
Daniel?

84
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,130
What's wrong?

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,910
charlotte,did you
hear what he said?

86
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,330
They're going to t orchid.

87
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,690
They're using the
secondary protocol.

88
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,250
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,840
we have to get off this island.

90
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,950
Right now.

91
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,870
we're catchin' up.

92
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,560
The chopper must've landed.

93
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,250
Why don't you take a break?

94
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,300
you're bleeding.

95
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,250
No,I'm not bleeding.

96
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,130
I'M...I'm suppurating.It'S...

97
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,830
discharge.

98
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,960
My body's just fightin' the
infection around the stitches.

99
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,630
You know when most people are lying
and they can't look you in the eye?

100
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,090
You do the exact opposite.

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,180
hey,long time no see.

102
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,680
hey,who are you talkin'
to up there,genghis?

103
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,460
Where's claire?

104
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,590
We lost her.

105
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,120
You what?

106
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,710
She just walked off in
the middle of the night.

107
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,370
We looked for her for a
da but she was just gone.

108
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,750
I was hopin' maybe she
went back to the beach.

109
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,240
She didn'T.

110
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,260
well,what are y'all doin' out here?

111
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,410
What's that phone for?

112
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,430
The chopper flew over the beach.

113
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,330
Someone tossed this out.

114
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,430
It must've been sayid.

115
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,730
Well,you better
hope it ain't sayid,

116
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,400
'cause if he's with those animals
that just blew up half of new otherton,

117
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,640
you do not wanna  tussle with 'em.

118
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,400
What,they tried to kill you?

119
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,390
Just like locke said they would.

120
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,940
So...what?We're supposed to just...

121
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,120
turn around and hide?

122
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,830
'Cause it seems like that
didn't work so well for you.

123
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,780
I'm sorry,doc,maybe this is dÃ©j?

124
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,300
vu,but didn't you just do the whole "run
through the jungle with a walkie" plan?

125
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,820
That helicopter is our
only way off this island.

126
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,640
what's with you and
"gettin' off the island"?

127
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,660
- You're like a damn broken record.
- Stop it!

128
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you two fightin'
each other now?

129
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,660
look.

130
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,720
I put sad and desmond
on that chopper.

131
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,400
It was my call.

132
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,820
It's my responsibility.

133
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,830
I'm going after it whether
they're on it or not.

134
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,270
You can all head back to the beach.

135
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,180
Jack...

136
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,270
no,no,no.You can't go by yourself.

137
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,230
Take care of the baby.Okay?

138
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,100
That son of a bih is stubborn.

139
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,540
hold up!

140
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,300
You don't get to die alone.

141
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,810
Based on the location
of the wreckage,

142
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,350
our best estimate of
the crash site is...

143
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,340
here.

144
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,340
From there,the survivors were
carried by the ocean's current to...

145
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:19,420
here... an uninhabited island in the
lesser sunda islands known as membata.

146
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,810
As you've all read in your
briefing books,on day 103...

147
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,900
a typhoon washed up the remnants
of an indonesian fishing boat,

148
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,880
including basic supplies
and a survival raft.

149
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,680
On day 108,the remaining six
survivors, including ms. Austen's baby

150
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,970
which she gave birth to
on the island of membata,

151
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,550
used this raft to journey here...

152
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,560
an island called sumba.

153
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,410
They then came ashore near
a village called manukangga.

154
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,380
This photo was taken by the
local fisherman who found them.

155
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,300
Once it was discovered
who they were,

156
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,510
they were transported to
honolulu by the U.S.Coast guard.

157
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:05,710
As you can imagine,this has been an
extraordinarily trying experience.

158
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,770
They have,however,agreed
to answer a few questions.

159
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,460
So,ladies and gentlemen, the
survivors of oceanic 8-1-5.

160
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,400
- yes.
- dr. Shephard!dr. Shephard!

161
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,270
Can you tell us what it was like
when the plane hit the ocean?

162
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,520
Uh,how you survived.

163
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,060
it...it all happened really fast.

164
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,950
I remember the impact.

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,530
I remember the...the plane
filling up with water.

166
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,230
A group of us got to the
emergency door,and,um...

167
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,070
got out before it went down.

168
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,000
And those of you who survived...
you swam to the island?

169
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,140
No.

170
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,020
We had,uh,cushions.

171
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,390
We had some life jackets.

172
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,100
We were in the water for over a
day before the current took us in.

173
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,190
By then,there was
only eight of us left.

174
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,130
over here!Over here,please!

175
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,350
Considering the ordeal that
you've all been through,

176
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,130
you look pretty healthy having been on
an island for more than a hundred days.

177
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,360
Was that directed at me,dude?

178
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,870
well,actually,mr. Reyes,you were worth more
than $150 million at the time of your...

179
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,110
death.

180
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,720
How does it feel to know you're
going to get all that money back?

181
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,700
I don't want it back,any of it.

182
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,880
That money was bad luck.

183
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,070
what did she say?

184
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,050
can somebody translate that?

185
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,810
She asked if my husband was one of
the people who died on the island.

186
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,440
the answer is no.

187
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,910
He never made it off the plane.

188
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,320
Ms. Austen...

189
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,670
what was it like giving
birth othe island?

190
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,050
Scary.

191
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,580
Your son...uh,aaron?

192
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,900
How old is he now?

193
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,930
He's just a little over 5 weeks.

194
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,400
So that would've made you
about six months pregnant

195
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,350
when the U.S.Marshal service

196
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,160
apprehended you in australia for
an outstanding murder warrant.

197
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,980
Is that correct?

198
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,320
Uh,I'm afraid ms. Austen's
legal issue is off the table.

199
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,740
Next question.

200
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,300
Mr. Jarrah,given the amazing
surrounding the survival of you six,

201
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
is it possible there are any other survivors
from the crash yet to be discovered?

202
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,160
No.Absolutely not.

203
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,590
you did good.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,190
Mr. Jarrah?

205
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,570
There's a woman outside.

206
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,840
She says she knows you,but she
wasn't on the list of family members.

207
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,410
Her name is a noor abed jaseem.

208
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,830
nadia?

209
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,670
Nadia.

210
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,500
Over here!

211
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,010
Sayid!

212
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,240
Where's desmond?

213
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,590
He's fine.He's on the freighter.

214
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,620
Listen,I'm going to start
takinpeople back... six at a time.

215
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,540
We have to go right now before the
helicopter gets back to the boat.

216
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,610
Why do we have to go to the boat
before the chopper gets back?

217
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,700
Because the men on that helicopter
have every intention of killing us all.

218
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,080
What?

219
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,250
Jack and kate just
went running after it.

220
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,520
so when is someone gonna
tell me where we're going?

221
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,250
We're going to a place
called the orchid,hugo.

222
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,600
And what's that?

223
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,530
It's a greenhouse.

224
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,280
And why are we going
to a greenhouse exactly?

225
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,160
You heard john. We're
going to move the island.

226
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,880
Right.

227
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,550
And how are we gonna do that?

228
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,370
Very carefully.

229
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,910
Well,if you could move the
island whenever you wanted,

230
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,640
why didn't you just move it before
the psychos with guns got here?

231
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,950
Because doing it is both
dangerous and unpredictable.

232
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,010
It's a measure of last resort.

233
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,440
Awesome.

234
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,200
Allow me.

235
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,620
may I have that mirror,please?

236
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
You know,those are 15 years old.

237
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,920
What are you doing,dude?

238
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,340
Communicating.

239
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,660
Communicating with who?

240
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,800
Who do you think?

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,540
All right.Now we can go.

242
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,700
Wait.What was that?What
did you tell them?

243
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,440
None of your business,john.

244
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,800
Hey,sayid,listen.

245
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,670
If you wanna run off into the jungle
after the chopper,you should do that.

246
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,070
But in the meantime,we need to
get these people off this island.

247
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:51,730
I won't be long.

248
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,010
If I can catch up
with jack and kate...

249
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,750
I can start ferrng people now.

250
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,090
I can get them there safely.

251
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,360
By the time you get back,I can have
most of these people on our boat.

252
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,910
I trust you know the bearing.

253
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,730
- You'd better get going.
- Thank you.

254
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,190
All right,first group in the raft.

255
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,170
We can fit six.

256
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,940
Okay,okay,hold on.

257
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,470
Sun is pregnant.

258
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,490
You should go first.

259
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,480
Sayid?

260
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,100
What are you doing here?

261
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,060
- Jack thought that you...
- I know what he thought.

262
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,490
That's why I'm going after
him how far ahead is he?

263
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,270
I dot know.He's...he's with sawyer.

264
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,680
I left them about an hour ago.

265
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,260
Jack's got a sat-phone, and
they're headed for the helicopter.

266
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,830
I can track them.

267
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,940
Look,you are not gonna catch
up to them unless I go with you.

268
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,920
- Let's go.
- Okay.

269
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,510
Sun.

270
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,540
Where's claire?

271
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,250
- Get aaron on the boat,okay?
- What?

272
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,600
It's all right.Just...

273
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,050
I'll see you there.

274
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,600
Ju keep him safe!

275
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,360
All right,this is just
the first trip. Here we go.

276
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,830
Okay.

277
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,540
mom?

278
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,980
Dad?

279
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,770
mr. Tron?

280
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,210
Lady tron?

281
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,930
hello?

282
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,290
why am I doing this?

283
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,480
Why am I doing this?

284
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,670
Why am I doing this?

285
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,070
surprise!

286
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,020
Happy birthday!

287
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,620
- hugo,what are you doing with that?
- I don't know.

288
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,490
I thought there might be
a prowler or something.

289
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
Jesus christ is not a weapon.

290
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,080
Okay.

291
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,520
Enjoy your party.

292
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,210
happy birthday,hurley.

293
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,020
Hey,kate.

294
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,110
Hey,little buddy.

295
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,200
Say hi.

296
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,860
Jack's running late.Sorry.

297
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,430
Happy birthday,hugo.

298
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,400
Wow,you guys are here.

299
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,860
Interesting choice of theme.

300
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,420
Yeah,my mom...

301
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,000
really doesn't get it,dude.

302
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,640
How's everybody doing?

303
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,860
what are you talking about?

304
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,780
Building a fire or huntin' boars?

305
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,500
I guess not.

306
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,170
Uh,listen.

307
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,230
Uh,do you mind,uh, excusing
us for a little while?

308
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,210
I-I wanna show you
your birthday present.

309
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,810
Come on.

310
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,790
Bye-bye now.

311
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,170
I told you I don't want anything.

312
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,510
Hugo,it's your birthday.

313
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,610
You gotta get somethin'.

314
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,860
Not with the money.

315
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,290
I don't want anything
from the money.

316
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,190
Relax.

317
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,120
I got thisbefore you
gave us the money.

318
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,520
Ta-da!

319
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,860
Check it out.

320
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,770
- You fixed it.
- Yeah.

321
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,880
After the crash,I-I worked
on it as a memorial to you.

322
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,280
When I was fixing it up, it
was almost like I was with ya.

323
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,030
But now you're
back,and it's all yours.

324
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,860
Wanna take her for a little spin?

325
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,230
is somethin' wrong,son?

326
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,140
Is this some kind of joke?

327
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,570
What are you talking about?

328
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,480
4,8,15,16,23,42.

329
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,170
Did you do this?

330
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,550
Do what?

331
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,970
Those are the numbers!

332
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,240
Right there!The nubers
I won the lottery with!

333
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,460
- What...what a coincidence.
- no

334
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,850
No,not a coincidence.

335
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,820
I don't want this.

336
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
I don't want any of it!

337
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,640
Hugo?

338
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,260
Wait...wait a minute.
Hugo,what are you...son!

339
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,510
Hugo!Hugo!Hugo,where
you goin'? Come on!Hugo!

340
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,480
Okay,let's say this greenhouse
place does what you say,

341
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,730
and,yeah,I get it.

342
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,430
It's really dangerous
and unpredictable.

343
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,840
But suppose somehow it
works, and we move the island.

344
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,340
Doesn't that mean the
dudewith guns move,too?

345
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,790
Yes,I suppose they would.

346
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,440
Well,isn'that,you know,a problem?

347
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm working on it.

348
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,350
Well,what about me?

349
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,790
I still wanna get off it!

350
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm afraid it's a little
late for that,hugo.

351
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,520
may I have the binoculars,please?

352
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,320
You might wanna get
down lower to the ground.

353
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,550
And why might we wanna do that?

354
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,690
Because we're at the orchid.

355
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,370
What are we waitin' for?

356
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,650
We're waiting,john,
because charles widmore,

357
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,200
the man who's trying to capture
me and kill all the rest of you,

358
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,370
knows about this place and knows
that what we need is inside.

359
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,030
I thought you said you had no idea
why he was trying to find he island.

360
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
I wasn't being entirely truthful.

361
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,020
Yeah.

362
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,610
When are you ever
entirely truthful?

363
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,540
You need to see this.

364
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,420
What am I looking for?

365
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,790
Look over there on
the left-hand side.

366
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,970
Watch the plants at the back.

367
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,340
I don't see any...

368
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,080
They're already.

369
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,720
hey,we're back!

370
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
where's sayid?

371
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,190
He had to go after jack.

372
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,490
You go.

373
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,390
They're headed for the chopper.

374
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,070
you okay?

375
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,780
Yes,I'm fine.Thank you.

376
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,010
I'm gonna head back
for the next group.

377
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,640
engine's fixed.

378
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,340
Tell hendricks to try it.

379
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,420
Okay,engine should be working.

380
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,520
indeed they are.

381
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,180
all right,well,take
us to the island.

382
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,470
but make sure you... you
stay on the bearing of 3-0-5.

383
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,880
It's gotta be
exactly 3-0-5.

384
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,990
we've got some kind of R.F.Interference
with the the fathometer.

385
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,870
I can't see the reef,mate.

386
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,540
R.F.Interference?

387
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
How is that possible?
The radio room's down.

388
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,890
I don't know,but something
on thiboat is broadcasting.

389
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,780
If we don't turn it off,I'm not going
any closer than 5 miles off the coast.

390
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,510
Then I'll find it.

391
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,340
cut yourself shavin'?

392
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,340
Juliet took out my appendix
a couple of days ago.

393
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,510
You kiddin' me.

394
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,030
Nope.

395
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,080
Well,what else did I miss?

396
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,960
we're here.

397
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,180
Lapidus!

398
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,140
Yeah!

399
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,650
you know this yahoo?

400
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,210
Yeah."Yahoo"?

401
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,680
This yahoo dropped that phone on
you guys so you could find me...

402
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,210
and I could fly you outta here.

403
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,930
So why don't you do me a favor
and get that back compartment?

404
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,610
There's a toolbox.

405
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,310
See if you can find something
to get me outta these things.

406
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,190
You heard the man.

407
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,160
Well,all right.

408
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,020
Can I get you boys a nice,cold glass
of lemonade while I'm back there?

409
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,780
Where are desmond and sayid?

410
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,850
Your buddies were smart enough
to keep their asses on the boat

411
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,410
because right now that's
the safest place to be.

412
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,110
Because when the boys that I brought over
here come stompin' out of this jungle,

413
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,390
you're gonna wanna be long gone.

414
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,660
Where'd they go?

415
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,150
They're up by some greenhouse, perched
up there,waitin' to snatch linus.

416
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,750
Soon as we cut you free, you'll
be able fly us out of here?

417
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,650
Hell,yeah.

418
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,020
Hang on,shaggy.

419
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,080
You said the hit squad's
gonna grab ben linus?

420
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,890
Well,I don't see
what's gonna stop 'em.

421
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,240
What are they gonna do with
the people that are with 'em?

422
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,120
Nothin' good.

423
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,750
Hugo's with ben.

424
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,760
son of a bitch.

425
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:28,900
About ten months ago,I wrote what I
wanted to say at my father's funeral

426
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:33,870
on the back of a cocktail
napkin at the sydney airport.

427
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,090
I don't remember what I
wrote, but whatever it was...

428
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,790
he would've hated it.

429
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,010
my father couldn't stand eulogies.

430
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:48,250
"The only good thing about a
wake is the free booze," he'd say.

431
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:55,240
not much of a wake because I
won't even be able to bury him.

432
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,220
So...

433
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,050
what I wanna say is
not for my father.

434
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,510
It's for me.

435
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,910
Good-bye,daD.

436
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,670
I loved you.

437
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,640
I miss you.

438
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,130
- Thanks very much for coming.
- I'm sorry.

439
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,320
Thank you for coming.Thanks.

440
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,720
- I'll see you back at the house?
- Yeah.

441
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,900
I love you,sweetheart.

442
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,810
I love you,mom.

443
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,300
I'm so glad you're home.

444
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,190
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

445
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,810
You did that well.

446
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,490
Had a lot of practice.

447
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,200
excuse me.

448
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,670
May I have a word with you?

449
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,020
mr. Shephard...

450
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm very sorry for your loss.

451
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,190
Thank you.

452
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,680
How did you know my father?

453
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:23,170
I believe I'm the reason he
was in australia when he died.

454
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,470
I'm sorry.

455
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,170
I don't understand.Why would
he have come to see you?

456
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,420
Oh,he...he didn't come to see me.

457
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,610
I was still in the hospital.

458
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,950
I never saw him.

459
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,180
He came to see his daughter.

460
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:47,950
My daughter,mr. Shephard.

461
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,170
- My father didn't have a daughter...
- yes.

462
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,820
He did.

463
00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:00,160
If you don't believe me,
check his phone records.

464
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,580
Would you like to know the...the strangest
thing about all this,mr. Shephard?

465
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,350
My daughter was on your plane,too.

466
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,070
She was on
flight 8-1-5.

467
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:26,290
you were in the air for six hours,
probably just a few rows from her

468
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,300
and you never even knew
she was your sister.

469
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,530
she was one of the ones who died
when your plane hit the water.

470
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,500
her name was...

471
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,340
claire.

472
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,070
I didn't mean to burden
you with this,but...

473
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,880
you needed to know.

474
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,280
I'M...

475
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,830
sorry for your loss.

476
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,240
your son is beautiful.

477
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,040
thank you.

478
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,440
N't understand.

479
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,430
How'd you get back to new york?

480
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,850
Uh,walt and I,uh,uh...

481
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,820
we took ben's boat and
we followed his bearing.

482
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,400
A couple of days,we came to
an island,you know,with people.

483
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,150
I sold the boat...

484
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,060
we hopped a cargo ferry
back to the states.

485
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,020
Didn't tell anybody who we were.

486
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,600
And now you're working for ben?

487
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,120
I do not work for ben.

488
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,660
I'm trying to make
up for what I did.

489
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,420
I'm trying to help you out here.

490
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,630
Translate what I said.

491
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,250
I understand.

492
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,390
Michael!

493
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,060
I need you now!

494
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,260
Oh,my god.

495
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:38,150
now.

496
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,150
what's the matter?

497
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,610
these aren't jack or sawyer.

498
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,770
They're different tracks,fresh...

499
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,050
and they're doubling
back behind us.

500
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,620
Whoever you are,come out now!

501
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,760
All right.

502
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,840
All right,let's just relax.

503
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,810
All right,let's...
let's just rel...

504
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,870
- Stop!Stop!
- Just relax.

505
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,150
Put the guns down.

506
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,710
I said stop right there!

507
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,110
Please just drop your guns.

508
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,860
Take one more step...

509
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,930
I said drop your guns.

510
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,490
I see two of them, but not
the one who killed alex.

511
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,030
He's there.

512
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,470
Hold on to that for me,will you?

513
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,660
What?

514
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,050
Listen to me very carefully,john,

515
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,700
because I'm not gonna
have time to repeat this.

516
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,990
You're gonna go into that
greenhouse through that hole there.

517
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,710
Once inside,you're gonna turn left.

518
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,630
Go about 20 paces until you see a
patch of anthuriums on your left.

519
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,010
They're in an alcove
against the north wall.

520
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,880
Face tt wall,reach down
with your left hand.

521
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:31,340
You'll find a switch that
activates the elevator.

522
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,520
The elevator takes you down
to the actual orchid station.

523
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,660
Whoa.Wait.What?

524
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,190
Okay,I'm sorry,ben,but maybe I
missed the part where you explained

525
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,590
what I'm supposed to do
about the armed men inside.

526
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,770
I'm gonna take care of them.

527
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,890
And how the hell are
you gonna do that?

528
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,800
How many times do I
have to tell you,john?

529
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,750
I always have a plan.

530
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,460
ben!

531
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,060
ben!

532
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,030
my name is benjamin linus.

533
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,050
I believe you're looking for me.
