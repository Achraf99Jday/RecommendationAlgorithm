1
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,300
what happened ?

2
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,220
You mean before or after
the redhead knocked me out ?

3
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,930
She hit you ?

4
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,860
When I ran into them on my
way back from locke's camp.

5
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,760
Why would she do that ?

6
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,590
I guess she didn't wanna have to explain
why she was on her way to a poison gas facty.

7
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,900
Juliet told jack that
it was a power station.

8
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,860
Why would juliet lie about that?

9
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,220
Force of habit?

10
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,740
Why were they going there?

11
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,360
To turn it off,to deactivate the gas.

12
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,290
I guess they wanted to
earn some brownie points.

13
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,130
Do you think they're
really going to rescue us?

14
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,420
In all the time they've been
here,they've talked about a lot of things,

15
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,240
and none involved rescuing us.

16
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,200
good morning.

17
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,740
Good morning.

18
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,180
I hope they resolve
their kitchen issues.

19
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,010
sayid.

20
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,720
What's that?

21
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,410
It's a note.

22
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,490
Three days ago,when
I was in locke's camp,

23
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,710
ben claimed he had a spy on this boat.

24
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,060
Don't Trust Captain.

25
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,560
hello.

26
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,800
My name is sun.

27
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,270
Hi,sun.

28
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm daniel.

29
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,850
Something I can help you with?

30
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,740
I'm two months pregnant.

31
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,030
Oh,you're...

32
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,360
wow,that'S...

33
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,380
congratulations.

34
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,400
So are you here to rescue us?

35
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,880
It's a simple question.

36
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:40,620
Are you or are you
not going to rescue us?

37
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,960
The thing is,um...

38
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,710
it's not really myall,sun.

39
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,680
Then whose call is it?

40
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,190
thank you.

41
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,490
Uh,can you pass,uh,the cereal?

42
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,030
Pretty good english,jin.

43
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,190
Thank you.

44
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,590
I... understandbetter than I,uh,speak.

45
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,860
Has sun been teaching you,or
are you just picking it up?

46
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,080
Uh,sun teach me.

47
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,270
Uh,sawyer,too.

48
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,090
Sun is... better.

49
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,280
I bet.

50
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,440
Hey,sun. How you feeling?

51
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,820
I'm good. Thank you.

52
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,100
The morning sicknesshas
stopped,which has been nice.

53
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,010
That's good. Well...

54
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,610
if you need anything,just
let me know,okay?

55
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,510
Would you likesome breakfast?

56
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,870
Jin...

57
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,300
You need to do as I say
and not ask questions.

58
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,810
What's the matter?

59
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,560
You need to find food for two days.

60
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,360
Meet me at the tent in twenty minutes.

61
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,150
Why?

62
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,550
What's happened?

63
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,090
We're going to Locke's camp.

64
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,330
What are you doing?

65
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,220
I needed another bottleof those
vitamins you gave me,the--the prenatals.

66
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,190
You could've just asked.

67
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,370
You're right. I should have.

68
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,340
What happenedto the
last ones I gave you?

69
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,320
Sorry?

70
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,170
The last bottle I gave you.
There should be 20 left.

71
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,170
Are you planning a trip?

72
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,690
Please,just give me the vitamins.

73
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,160
Where are you going,un?

74
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,850
- We're going to locke's camp.
- What?

75
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,050
Why?

76
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,010
Because I don't trustthese people.

77
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,210
Whether you trust them
or not,you can't go there.

78
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,840
Locke doesn't wantto leave the island,and
I've told you,sun,prnant women...

79
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,050
they don't survive here.

80
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,370
Yes,you did tell me that.

81
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,450
You don't believe me.

82
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,840
Look,I know that I have beenless than
truthful about certain thingssince cong here,

83
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,160
but I promise you,sun,I promise you...

84
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm not lying about this.

85
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,480
After everythingyou've confided in
me,I should at leasthave your trust.

86
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,460
Claire's baby is fine.

87
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,700
I feel fine.

88
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,510
All I have are your storiesthat
I'm going to get sick.

89
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,180
I'm going to do what's bestfor
me and for my baby,because,no...

90
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,430
i don't trust you.

91
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,780
It's okay.It's going to be okay.

92
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,680
Is
that--?

93
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes.Oceanic Six.

94
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,000
Stop!What are you doing?

95
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,670
We remove all jewelry.

96
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,240
It's for the swelling.

97
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,170
No!Not my ring!

98
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,870
Nothing will happen to it.

99
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,370
It's okay.

100
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,640
Mrs.Kwon.I'm Dr.Bae.

101
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,740
I'm on duty for Dr.Park.

102
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,460
Where is he?What's happening?

103
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,350
He's away at a conference...

104
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,460
Get her something for the pain.

105
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,820
Now let me take a look...

106
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,420
Is something wrong with my baby?

107
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,220
It is in distress.

108
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,100
What's wrong?

109
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,390
I don't know yet.

110
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,560
That's what I'm going to find out.

111
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,270
Is there anyone we should contact?

112
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,960
Your husband?Your parents?

113
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,510
Just get Jin...my husband...

114
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,110
Jin...

115
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,370
Just get Jin...

116
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,770
I'll try to reach him.

117
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,280
Get my...husband...

118
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,430
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

119
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,920
Jin...

120
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,540
taxi!

121
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,660
Yes,I'm on my way...Hello?

122
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,180
Hello...

123
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,870
Hey!What is this?

124
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,220
Stop!

125
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,590
You bastard!

126
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,910
I will kill you!

127
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,430
If I find you!

128
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,710
I will hunt you down
and rip your head off!

129
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,390
I need another panda!

130
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,920
I'm sorry,that was the last one.

131
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,130
What about that one?

132
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,940
It's right behind you!

133
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,360
That one is on hold.

134
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,450
They're quite popular.

135
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,500
How much do you want?

136
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,410
It's already paid for.

137
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,610
What about this...

138
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,490
In the year of the dragon.

139
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,050
it brings good luck.

140
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,270
I need the panda.

141
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,260
Don't lose this one.

142
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,520
once you hit the stream,you
wanna head northwest,

143
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,090
pretty much in a straight line
for about a day and a half.

144
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,710
Thank you.

145
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm gonna have to tell jack.

146
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,820
But I'll give you guysa
nice,long head start.

147
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,530
I'd tell him myself,but
he wouldn't understand.

148
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,300
No,he wouldn't

149
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,470
you better get going.

150
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,120
Be safe,okay?

151
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,950
thank you.

152
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,390
She's not going anywhere.

153
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,410
Sun,this is a bad idea.

154
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,860
What concern is itof yours?

155
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,890
Do you understand your
wife'smedical condition right now?

156
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,960
Translate for me.

157
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,110
No.

158
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,370
Your wife is very sick.

159
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,690
If she doesn't get offthis island
in three weeks,she will die.

160
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,360
if you let her go,your
wife is in danger. Jin...

161
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,470
danger.

162
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,560
Wherever sun go... I go.

163
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,110
Sun. Please.

164
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,240
Jin.

165
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,510
Your wife had an affair.

166
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,670
Wh?

167
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,380
Sun was with another man.

168
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,470
She thoughtthe baby was his.

169
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,580
Jin...

170
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,660
Jin...

171
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,510
Talk to me.Let me explain.

172
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,000
It was a long time ago.

173
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,640
Look at me.

174
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,840
Just look at me.

175
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,960
I understand you're angry.

176
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:55,190
And I have no excuse.

177
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,960
Please let me explain.

178
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,080
Let me explain!

179
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,860
Jin...

180
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,220
You going fishing?

181
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
Uh,you mind if I... tag along?

182
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,610
Oh,I am sorry. I-I
didn't mean to interrupt.

183
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,370
No. Come.

184
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,320
You re?

185
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,150
Yes. Come.

186
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:53,060
you realize we're the only
twomarried guys on the island?

187
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,270
Married.

188
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,000
Married.

189
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,910
Yeah,well,no,not to each other. No.

190
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,960
you got iT.

191
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,090
It's not easy,is it?

192
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,090
Oh,I mean,it's--it's
wonderful,but...

193
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,500
let's face it. Every decision
that you maketakes twice as long

194
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,920
cause you always gottatalk them into it.

195
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,850
Rose...

196
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,820
has cancer.

197
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,900
She's sick.

198
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,170
Dying.

199
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,690
Well,at least,she was dying.

200
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,200
She saysshe's better now.

201
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,740
She saysit's this place...

202
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,520
the island.

203
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,270
But when the campsplit up,

204
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,320
I was sure that she'd
wantto go with locke.

205
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,370
Why would she wantto leave the
island and riskgetting sick again?

206
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,380
Uh,then why do you staywith jack?

207
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,020
Because it wasthe right thing to do.

208
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,190
Locke?

209
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,640
He's a murderer.

210
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,950
See,it's all about karma,jin.

211
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,110
Do you know karma?

212
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,100
You make bad choices,bad
things happen to you.

213
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,350
But you make good
choices,and then good-- hey!

214
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,150
Hey,hey,hey!You got one.

215
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,710
Yeah.Here,pull it in.

216
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,720
Wow,look at that!

217
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,240
Yeah,you see?

218
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Now that's karma.

219
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,930
We must be the good guys,huh?

220
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,460
how long'sthat gonna go on for,eh?

221
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,280
Can't they just fix whateverthe
bloody hell's causing that?

222
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,610
That sound is not mechanical.

223
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,710
What,you thinksomebody's doing that?

224
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,060
Somebody's just banging
those pipes again and again?

225
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,350
That's exactly what I think.

226
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,640
gentlemen...

227
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,130
thanks for your patience.

228
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,210
The captain would liketo see you now.

229
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,790
where's the helicopter?

230
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,780
Lapidusis running an errand.

231
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,560
What kind of errand?

232
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm a doctor.I don't
know where he's going.

233
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,220
Did he go to the island?

234
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,330
you know anywhere elsehe could land?

235
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,950
wh's he going to do?

236
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,890
I said I'm just a doctor.

237
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,010
What did lapidus say?

238
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,700
He didn't say anything.

239
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,600
What is he doing?

240
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,910
That woman just jumpedover
the side of the ship!

241
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,220
Don't just stand there!

242
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,430
What'sthe matter with you people?

243
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,780
what's wrong with you?Get a rope!

244
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,450
Why aren't you doing anything?

245
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,730
Bring a rope!

246
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,610
Get a rope!

247
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,220
- Get a rope!
- Stop!

248
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,850
She just jumped!

249
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,140
it's over.

250
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,190
She's gone.

251
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,100
Everybodyget back to your posts.

252
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,560
That was an order.

253
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,150
I'm captain gault.

254
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,080
I suppose you twohave a few questions.

255
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
So what can I do for you?

256
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,070
What?

257
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,900
You boys said you
wanted to speak with me.

258
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,670
Let's just start with why a woman jumpedover the
side of your ship,and you did nothing to stop it.

259
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:02,010
I didn't jump inor order my crew to jump in
because I didn't wantto lose any more people.

260
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,020
What exactlyis going on here?

261
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,910
Some of my crewhas been dealing with...

262
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,180
what mightbest be described as
a heightened caseof cabin fever.

263
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,890
I thinkit's got something to do with
the close proximity of the island.

264
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,270
Why don't you turn around,then?

265
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,750
I've tried,but we havea saboteur on board,and
he's done one hellof a job on my engines.

266
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,600
I've got my crew workingaround
the clock to repair them.

267
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,020
And then you'lltake our people home?

268
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,980
Then we moveto safer waters.

269
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,500
Those are my orders.

270
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,410
And I don't suppose you'll
tellus who gave you those orders?

271
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,700
Sure,I will.

272
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,670
Charles widmore.

273
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,890
This ischarles widmore's boat?

274
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,690
That's right.You know him.

275
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,370
Do either of youknow what this is?

276
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,420
It's a flight data recorder,otherwise
known as a black box.

277
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,900
That's exactly what it is.

278
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,920
Now here's the funny thing.

279
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,140
This black box comesfrom
oceanic flight 8-1-5.

280
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,150
A salvage vessel recovered
itfrom the bottom of the ocean.

281
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,060
It took a considerable amountof mr.
Widmore's resources to procure it.

282
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,090
It was found withthe wreckage of the
plane,along with all 324 dead passengers.

283
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,630
That's notthe complete story,as
you are well aware,mr. Jarrah,

284
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,680
given the fact that
you'restanding here,breathing.

285
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,800
The wreckagewas obviously staged.

286
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:01,820
Now can you imagine what kindof resources and
manpower go into pulling off a featof that magnitude?

287
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,300
Faking the recoveryof a plane crash?

288
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:11,330
Putting 324 familiesthrough a
grieving process based on a lie?

289
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,740
But what'seven
more disturbing--

290
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,450
where exactlydoes one come
across 324 dead bodies?

291
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,780
And that,mr. Jarrah,mr. Hume,is justone
of the many reasons we want benjamin linus.

292
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,650
I'm sorry.

293
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,360
I had to stop youany way I could.

294
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,930
It wasn't your placeto stop us.

295
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:58,120
I know you don't trust me,but you
need to get offis island.We all do.

296
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,360
You want to leave?

297
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,100
More than anything.

298
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,330
I don't know if that boatout there is
the answer or not,but it's something.

299
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,510
I need to go home.

300
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,500
So do you.

301
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,260
Sun...

302
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,250
in about three weeks,you'll be in
an almost constantstate of nausea.

303
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:26,820
A week after that,you willexperience
shortness of breath that won't go away.

304
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,620
A week after that,you will lose
consciousness and slip into a coma.

305
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,160
And then,sun,you will die.

306
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,410
And when your heartstops beating...

307
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,790
so will the baby'S.

308
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,390
And that,sun,is why it is my
business,because you are my patient.

309
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,910
If you go...

310
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,290
you will die...

311
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,650
and your babywill never be born.

312
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,550
I have to perform a c-section

313
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,820
no

314
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,000
you don't understand...

315
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,300
the medication makes a
natural birth difficult

316
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,360
no no!not until jin...

317
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,670
we've got to get to surgery

318
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,970
where is my husband?

319
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,540
he's  no here yet

320
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,660
we cannot wait

321
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,380
jin

322
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,730
jin

323
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,580
dr.bae

324
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,690
the baby is crowning

325
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,730
ok, sun you need to push now

326
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,690
that's it... push push

327
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
you can do it

328
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,290
that's push

329
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,090

330
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,170

He wassurprisingly forthcoming.

334
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,140
Yeah,he tells it like it is.

335
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,050
Just don't piss him off.

336
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,770
You know what I mean?

337

I thinkyou'll like your room.It's
on a quiet partof the ship.

338
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,160
This ship isn't moving.

339
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,280
Well,if you say so.

340

Nice to meet you,kevin.

352
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,660
I made...

353
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,690
dinner.

354
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,490
I thought you had left me

355
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,940
will you let me try to explain?

356
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,270
it won't matter

357
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,730
just listen,maybe...

358
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,830
I know why you did it

359
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,340
I know the man...

360
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,630

361
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,750
before thid island

362
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,090
I withheld my affections...

363
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,170
and I know...

364
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,510
that whatever you did...

365
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,310
you didi to that man

366
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,900
his actions caused this

367
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,610
so I forgive  you

368
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,730
so I will go to locke's camp with you

369
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,420
I don't want to go there anymore

370
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,160
why?

371
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,920

372
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,100

373

374
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,310

375
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,160
