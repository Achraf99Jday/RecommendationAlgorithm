00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,950
What's that?

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,200
Cheat sheetfaraday drew for me.

6
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,270
You don't knowwhere your boat is?

7
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,700
I know where it is.

8
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,990
Why are you flying
directlyinto the thunderhead?

9
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,200
Why don't you just sit
backand let me do my job,huh?

10
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,930
is that penelope?

11
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,860
She told charlie she didn't
knowabout this boat,correct?

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,910
Aye.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,220
What do you expect to
find when you get there?

14
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,820
Answers.

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,640
hold on!

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,030
on your soddin' feet!

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,810
Move! Move!Move!

18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,330
What areou waiting for,hume?

19
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,290
What's the matter,hume?

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,900
Did you not hear me?

21
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm sorry,sir. I was--I
was having a dream,sir.

22
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,920
You were having a dream,were you?

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,460
And what were youdreaming about that

24
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,800
it took you so sding
long to get to your mark?

25
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,600
I was in a helicopter,sir,and
there was a storm,sir.

26
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,780
And...

27
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,470
I don't remember the rest,sir.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Well,at least it wasa
bloody military dream.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,050
Right! All of ya!

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,910
In the yard! Four minutes!

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,700
And you can thank private hume
for having to do itin double-time.

32
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,580
Move!

33
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,420
- one,two,three!
- three!

34
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,340
- One,two,three!
- four!

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,340
- One,two,three!
- five.

36
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,660
100 crunches!

37
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,040
Go!Go!Go!Go!Go!

38
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,640
One! Two!Three...

39
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,950
I hope your dreamwas worth this,mate.

40
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,270
Sorry,pal. It's just...

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,480
I've never had a dreamthat
was so vivid.It was--

42
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,060
it was like I was actually there.

43
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,250
Have you gotsomething to say,hume?

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,510
I asked you a question!

45
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,200
we're almost through it.

46
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,230
I see daylight.

47
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,130
What do you thinkyou're doing?

48
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,750
Desmond,are you all right?

49
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,280
Who are you?

50
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,980
How do you know my name?

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,900
here you go.

52
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,690
All right,they took off a day ago.

53
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,940
Why haven't we heard from 'em?

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,090
I'm gonna tell you again,as i've been
telling you all night,doctor,I don't know!

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,950
You heard the same thing as
I did when we called the boat.

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,220
What makes you think I know anything?

57
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,830
Because you're not worried.

58
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,880
Excuse me?

59
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,330
Your boat's 40 miles off the coast.

60
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,290
It should've taken 'em,what,20
minutes to get there?

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,550
So why aren't you worried?

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,220
Well,should I wring my hands together
and whisper a prayer on their behalf?

63
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,540
Come on.

64
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,110
Maybe we should
just-- just tell 'em.

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,390
- Tell us what?
- Dan...

66
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,570
let's not confuse anyone.

67
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,700
Well...

68
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,480
daniel,maybe if you talk real
slow,we'll be able to follow.

69
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,380
Your perception of how long
your friends have been gone...

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,960
it's not necessarily how long
they've actually been gone.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,550
What does that mean?

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,990
This is a mistake.

73
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,400
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.

74
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,090
As long as frank flew on the bearings
that I gave him,if he stayed on it,it...

75
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,300
it'll be fine.

76
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,590
And what if he didn't?

77
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,740
Then there might be side effects.

78
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,350
we're at 2,000 feet. Sit down!

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,230
- What am I doing here?
- What the hell's going on?

80
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,060
- Something's wrong with desmond.
- W do you know my name?

81
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,090
Hold him in his seat!

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,810
- I'm trying!
- Let go of me!

83
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,930
Keep him away fr the stick!

84
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,460
We'll be there in two minutes!

85
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,910
what are you doing back?

86
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,750
who are they?

87
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,850
Survivors of 815.

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,030
So you brought them here. What
the hell were you thinking?

89
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:14,760
Where--where
am I?

90
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,640
- All right,just take it easy.
- Who are you people?

91
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,250
- buddy.Okay,now,take it easy,buddy.
- Wh-what am I doing here?

92
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,130
- Who are you people?
- My friend is disoriented.

93
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,310
Look,I'm not your friend!

94
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,060
I don't know you! I don't know you!

95
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,260
When did he start doing this?

96
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,930
He was fine when we took off.

97
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,870
When we hit
some weather--

98
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,010
hey,faraday told me as long
as I stayed on the vector--

99
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,020
What's your name,my friend?

100
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,710
Sayid.

101
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,850
Okay,sayid.

102
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,130
Look,we're gonna take your
buddy down to the sick bay,okay?

103
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm going with him.

104
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,390
Let our doctor look at him
first,then you can come down.

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,600
You got my word on that,okay?

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,660
All right.

107
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,210
Hey,listen to me--
th-this is a mistake,right?

108
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,330
- I don't know these people.I don't know these people.
- No,no,no.oh,no,no,I understand.

109
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,910
No,but this is wrong!

110
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,670
I'm not supposed to be here.

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,440
20! 21!22

112
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,070
- "Here"?
- "Here" what?

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,350
What the hell are you
doing on your feet?

114
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,680
Are you finished with your
crunches becausyou want to run?

115
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,380
Right! Squad!

116
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,780
On your feet!

117
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,670
Right face!

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
10 kilometers! Go!Go!Go!Go!Go!Go!Go!

119
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,990
Get moving,or so help
me,I'll kill you myself.

120
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,710
what the hell's the matter with you,des?

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,020
If I told you,you'd think I was crazy.

122
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,700
I already know you're crazy.

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,010
this morning,when I was in
the yard doing crunches...

124
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,070
I left.

125
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,370
What do you mean,you left?

126
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,170
I was on a boat.

127
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,670
And then--then I was back
here,right--right where I started.

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,990
Des,if you're trying to
get tossed out of service--

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,150
billy,i am telling you the truth,man.

130
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,650
Who else was on this... boat?

131
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,500
Anyone you recognize?

132
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,690
Penny.

133
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,470
There was a photo.

134
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,880
- Penny was in the photo.
- What?

135
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,240
Oi,des!

136
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,230
Where you going?

137
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,260
thanks for this morning,hume

138
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,870
Watch your step.

139
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,870
Watch it. Watch your step.Take it easy.

140
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,850
I'm not here. This...

141
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,680
this--this
isn't happening.

142
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,440
You are here,and this is happening.

143
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,840
Look,we're gonna take care of you.

144
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,630
W-what am I doing here?

145
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,650
- It's all right.You're gonna be okay.
- I'm not supposed to be here.

146
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,470
- Who are you people?
- Well...

147
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,400
my name is keamy,and this is omar.

148
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,350
I'm from vegas,and he's from florida.

149
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,080
But as for where we are,I--
we last ported in fiji.

150
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,710
So at least we know we're
still in the pacific.

151
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,110
all right,my friend.

152
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,880
Now you just relax,okay?

153
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,680
We're gonna go get the doc,and he's gonna wannaask
you some questions to--to help us sort all this out.

154
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,880
Wh-what do you mean,"sort out"?
Wait a minute.What do you mean?

155
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,110
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'm not supposed to be here!

156
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,130
Open this door! Open this door!

157
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,130
It's happening to you,too,isn't it?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
what's happeningto desmond?

159
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,370
Your friends knowwhat's wrong with him.

160
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,970
Well,if they do,they're
notsharing it with me.

161
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,240
Then perhaps you'll sharehow we took off
at dusk and landedin the middle of the day?

162
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,460
listen, I don't know what's
happeningto your buddy, all right?

163
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,280
But you gotta trust
mewhen I tell you this.

164
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,060
I am trying to help you.

165
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,060
You want to help me?

166
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,740
Give me your phone.

167
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,080
Let me call my people.

168
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,470
You give me that weapon,and
I'll give you this phone.

169
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,350
be quick.

170
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't go tryingto call baghdad.
Those phonesonly call each other.

171
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,250
hello?

172
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,360
Jack? It's sayid.

173
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,250
I'm on the freighter.

174
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,040
are you okay? Where
the hell have you been?

175
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,770
Something happenedduring the flight,and
now desmond'sin their sick bay.

176
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,470
Hold on. Hold on,hold on,hold on.

177
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,350
all right,you're on speaker.

178
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,410
On the helicopter,something
happened to desmond.

179
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,310
He doesn't appear to
recognizeme or knowhere he is.

180
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,370
"Side effects"?

181
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,440
Wait,your
friend,um,desmond--has he...

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:06,940
has he recently been exposedto high
levels of radiation or electromagnetism?

183
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,790
Okay,look,uh,we don't know why,

184
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,360
but going toand coming from the
island,some people can get a little...

185
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,020
confused.

186
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,990
So... what?This is amnesia?

187
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,690
No,this is not amnesia.

188
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,020
Can you hear me?

189
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:38,350
Are you all right? Hello?

190
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,300
I was juston a ferris wheel.

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,910
see,ray?

192
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,970
I'm not crazy.

193
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,510
it's happening to him,too,ray,and
it's gonna happen to you.

194
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,770
It's gna happen to all of us,everyone...

195
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,930
once we start headingto
that island again.

196
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,030
Would you please step aside?

197
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,580
No. No.

198
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,800
Ray,no.

199
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,410
I need you to relax for a minute.

200
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,720
No. Noit's notgonna stop it,ray!

201
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,280
Nothing can stop it,ray!
Nothing can stop it!

202
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,860
And how are you feeling?

203
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,610
What the bloody hellis going on?

204
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,670
I understand you're disoriented.

205
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,870
- You're not gonna stick mewith that,brother!
- I...

206
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,220
don't wanna stick youwith anything.

207
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,220
It's okay.

208
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,340
I just wanna check your eyes.

209
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,930
Why?

210
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,170
So I can help you.

211
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,450
What's your name?

212
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,950
Desmond.

213
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,600
desmond.

214
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,880
Desmond,why don't you tell
meabout the last thing you remem--

215
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,300
hello?

216
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,210
Penny?

217
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,540
What do you want,smond?

218
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,980
Um,penny,listen,I'm,uh...

I'm in trouble,and,uh... but I...

220
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,400
I think something'shappening
to me,and...

221
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm confused and... I...

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,840
I need to see you.

223
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,200
You broke off with me,and
then you joined the army,

224
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,330
and now you callwith some expectation
that I still care about you?

225
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,390
Yeah,I'd sayyou are confused,desmond.

226
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,980
No,no,I'm not.
It's--it'S...

229
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,830
No,and don't bothershowing up at
the flat either,'cause I've moved.

230
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,580
Moved? Where?

231
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,930
It doesn't matter.

232
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,480
Look,desmond,I'm going to go.

233
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,150
- Please,just don't call me again.
- No,no.No,listen.

234
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,560
Penny,penny,I
ne--penny,i need you.

235
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,240
Did you just...

236
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,150
experience something,desmond?

237
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,130
what the hell,frank?

238
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,450
You're notsupposed to be down
here,and definitely not with him.

239
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,650
Sorry,doc,but I got
faradaycalling from the island.

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,450
- He needs to talk to the scottish guy.
- No,faraday's not talking tomy patient.

241
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,150
- Now get out of here.
- But he's not your patient.

242
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,980

245
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,750
Desmond? Desmond,my

246
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,100
We met yesterdaybefore you took off,but I'm
guessingyou don't remember that. Am right?

247
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,460
Took off? What?

248
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,030
Desmond,we don't have long to talk,so I
need you to tell mewhat year you think it is.

249
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,770
what do you mean,what
year do I think--it's 1996.

250
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,010

251
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,170
Desmond,look,you--you

252
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,330
Where are you?

253
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,420
I-I'm in--I'm in
some kind of sick bay.

254
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,410
No,no,no. Not right now,desmond.

255
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,140
Wherare you supposed to
be? Where are you in 16?

256
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,800
I-I'm at camp millar.
It's,uh,royal scots regiment.

257
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,740
It's,uh,just north of glasgow.

258
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,450
- Dan,you might wanna-- -
y-yeah,yeah.No.No,I'm thinking.I'm thinking.

259
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,620
desmond,listen,when it happens
again,desmond,I need you to get on a train.

260
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,220
Get on a trainand go to oxford.

261
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,650
Oxford university.

262
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,430
Queen's collegephysics
department,all right?

263
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,520
W-what? Why?

264
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,580
Because I need youto find me.

265
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,410
Where is it? Where is it?

266
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,370
What?

267
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,710
My journal,my journal.

268
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,050
I need my journal,or I won'telieve him.

269
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,200
Why does he think e think he's in 1996?

270
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,320
I don't know. I don't know.

271
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,450
It's unpredictable.
It's a random effect.

272
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,220
Sometimes the displacement'sonly a
couple of hours. Sometimes it's years.

273
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,710
Wait,wait,this has happened before?

274
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,660
The phone now,please. Thank you.

275
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,460
- Desmond,are you still there?
- doc?

276
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,940
- Hey,doc,are you okay in there?
- Talk to him.

277
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,660
I can't hold them for long.

278
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,900
Um,yes. Yes,I'm here.

279
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,630
Okay,desmond,listen,when
youfind me at queen's college,

280
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,920
I need you to tell meto
set the device to 2.342

281
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:45,770
What?

282
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,740
All right,you got it? 2.342

283
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,790
And it must be oscillatingat 11 hertz.

284
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,410
you got it,desmond?

285
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,380
2.342,oscillating at 11...

286
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,760
just--ju remember that--2.342
at 11 hertz,all right?

287
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,700
And one more thing,desmond.

288
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:07,510
If the numbersdon't convince me,I need
you to tell methat you know about eloise.

289
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,400
- Easy,easy.
- Get off the phone.

290
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,860
Tell me that you
knowabout elo-- ...

291
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,020
not a single pieceof
original thinking...

292
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,380
the concept of "original"--
the opposite of derivative.

293
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,910
I am the one for youto impress,mr.
Hollister,and I'm not impressed.

294
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,440
So go. Go try again.

295
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,090
Um,sorry,are--are
you daniel faraday?

296
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,550
You are?

297
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:10,190
Uh,I'm sorry. I'm--I'm desmond
hume,and,uh,I was toldI could find you here.

298
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,970
And I think I've...

299
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,480
I've just beento the future.

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,050
- The future?
- Yes.

301
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,330
Uh,I-I spoke to you there.

302
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,990
You,uh,you told meto come
here to--to oxford to find you.

303
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,620
You--you said
you'd help me.

304
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,000
Why didn't I just help
youthere in the future?

305
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,810
Rry?

306
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,380
Why would I put you throughthe
headache of time traveling?

307
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,980
You--younow what I mean? It just
seems a little...unnecessary?

308
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,950
And don't you thinkmy esteemed colleagues could've
come upwith something just a little morebelievable,h?

309
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,040
what kind of a prank is that?

310
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,140
Time paradox--so
uninspired.

311
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,030
Set your device to,um...

312
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,540
2.342 and--and make
sureit oscillates at 11.

313
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,540
Okay,now--now
you...

314
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,220
you're gonna tell mewho
told you those numbers.

315
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,310
- You did.
- No,this is...

316
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,990
this is ridiculous.

317
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,020
I know about eloise.

318
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,040
what--what
is all this?

319
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:37,610
This is where I do the
thingsoxford frowns upon.

320
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,030
All right,this...

321
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,610
this future version of me,uh,he--he
referencedthis meeting,right?

322
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,700
Obviously. So--so I would
rememberyou coming to oxford,right?

323
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,040
I would remember this,here,right now.

324
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,150
- Actually,um,no.
- No?

325
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,960
Maybe you just forgot.

326
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,900
Yeah,right. How would that happen?

327
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,340
This--this
ischanging the future?

328
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,190
You can't changethe future.

329
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,530
What's that for?

330
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,760
Radiation.

331
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,200
do I get one?

332
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,250
You don't need one.
For prolonged exposure.

333
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,070
I-I do this 20 times a day.

334
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,440
so what do you puton your head?

335
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,130
yeah.

336
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,890
this... this is eloise.

337
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,760
what does this do?

338
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,660
This...

339
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,850
if the numbers you gave me are
correct,what this will do...

340
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:53,230
is unstick eloise in time,just like you.

341
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,030
- what happened?
- Wait,shh,shh.

342
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,920
She's not back yet.

343
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,770
There she is.

344
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,490
Okay,here goes...everything.

345
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,580
come on,ce on.

346
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
That's it.

347
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,650
That's it.That's it.

348
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,440
That's it.

349
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,110
That's it.

350
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,030
it worked!

351
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,820
Th-this is incredible.

352
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,690
I'm sorry.How is a rat running
througha bloody maze so incredible?

353
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,130
What is incredible is I just
finished the mazethis morning,

354
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,350
and I'm not gonnateach her how
to run it until hour from now.

355
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,760
s-so--so you--you
sent herto the future.

356
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,830
No,no,no,her consciousness,her mind.

357
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,980
So--so how does
that help me?

358
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,070
You?

359
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,530
Help you?I don't understand.

360
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,920
Am I supposed to help you?Didn't
I send you back here to help me?

361
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,790
I don't know whyyou sent me here.

362
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,150
All I know about youis you--
you end upon some bloody island.

363
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,850
An island?

364
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,560
What island?W-why
would I go to an I--

365
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,730
desmond,give me the phone.

366
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,220
Hey,come on!Everybody relax!

367
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,660
Listen,look,daniel wanted to talk to the
guy,so we brought him the phone,that's all.

368
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,580
You let faraday talk to him?

369
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,560
He said he could help.

370
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,330
Faradaycan't even help himself!

371
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:52,120
- Outside now.
- The captain wants to talk to you.

372
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,850
And i want to talk to your captain.

373
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,660
I'll be sureto let him know.

374
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,150
In the meantime,have a seat.

375
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,110
I need to get back.

376
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,720
Back where?The island?

377
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,280
He said he could
help.He said --

378
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,040
he'd tell me what I needed to do.

379
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,970
- Desmond,desmond,can you
please explain to me-- - desmond?

380
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,770
You're desmond?

381
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,890
Do I know you?

382
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,130
I'm george minkowski.

383
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,970
I'm the communications officer.

384
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,830
Beforethey strapped me down here,

385
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:31,900
all the calls to and fromthis boat
came through me in the radio room.

386
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:39,170
And every so often,I'd get this
flashing lighton my console--

387
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,530
an incoming call.

388
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,850
We were under strict
ordersnever to answer it.

389
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,380
So?What's that got to do with me?

390
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,280
Those callscame from your girlfriend.

391
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,310
Penelope widmore.

392
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,910
what happened?

393
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,710
Oh,uh,you're back.

394
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,480
And...

395
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,930
you were outalmost 75 minutes.

396
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,760
Out?

397
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,780
Oh,yeah.Yeah,yeah.

398
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,360
You just...whew.You went catatonic
rightin the middle of a sentence.

399
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,820
I had to carry youto the chair.

400
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,580
So I take it you were-- you
were in the future again?

401
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,490
Aye.

402
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,560
- For how long?
- I don't know.

403
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,730
Five minutes?

404
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,720
why does thiskeep happening?

405
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,700
Uh,in your case,I'm guessing
the progressionis exponential.

406
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,510
each timeyour consciousness jumps,it
gets harder and harderto jump back.

407
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,980
I would be careful crossingthe
street if I were you.

408
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,540
what happened to her?

409
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,360
She died.

410
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,700
Yeah,I can see that.How?

411
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,760
Brain aneurysm,probably.I don't know.

412
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,490
I'm going to doan autopsy later.

413
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,930
Is that gonna happen to me?

414
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,620
The effects seem to varyfrom
case to case,but,uh...

415
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,890
answer me!

416
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,630
If this keeps happening,am I gonna die?

417
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't know.

418
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,930
I think...

419
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,510
eloise's brainshort-circuited.

420
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,760
The jumps betweenthe
present and the future--

421
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,340
she eventually--she
couldn'ttell which was which.

422
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,750
She had no anchor.

423
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,290
Wh-what do youean,"anchor"?

424
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,970
Something familiarin both times.

425
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,260
All this--see this?This
is all variables.

426
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,640
It's random.It's chaotic.

427
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,770
Every equation needs
stability,something known.

428
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,540
It's called a constant.Desmond,you
have no constant.

429
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,970
When you go to the
future,nothing there is familiar.

430
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,780
So if you want
to stop this,y--

431
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,040
then you needto find something there,

432
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,620
somethinthat you
really,really care about...

433
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,500
that also exists back here...

434
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,890
in 1996.

435
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,400
This constant...

436
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,240
can it be a person?

437
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,270
Yeah,maybe.

438
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,850
But you have to
makesome kind of contact.

439
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,680
Didn't you say you were off on
a boatin the middle of nowhere?

440
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,850
Uh...

441
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,970
who are you calling?

442
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,220
I'm callingmy bloody constant.

443
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,670
the number you have dialed
has been disconnected.

444
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,710
hey,hey.

445
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,570
You okay?

446
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,570
you look a lot older now,huh?

447
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,820
Welcome back,desmond.

448
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,340
I need to call penny.

449
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,230
Calling your girlfriendis
not our priority.

450
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:00,490
Listen,brother,I don't know
you,but-- but you seem to know me,

451
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,670
so--so if you and meare
friends,then I need your help.

452
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,130
I need to call penny now.

453
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,320
You boys are gettin'way
ahead of yourselves.

454
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Two days ago,someonesabotaged
all the equipment.

455
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,290
Lost all communicationwith the mainland.

456
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,610
I probably could've fixed it,but then...

457
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,890
then I went nuts.

458
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,920
- Where's the radio room?
- It's one deck up.

459
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,610
I'll take you there.

460
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,030
Come on.

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,460
And how do weget out of here?

462
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,930
Through the door.

463
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,760
Looks like you guys
havea-a friend on this boat.

464
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,660
hey,uh...

465
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,740
your nose,brother.

466
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,470
it's clear.

467
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,400
Let's
go--

468
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,960
"the black rock" set sail from
portsmouth,english,march 22,1845,

469
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,210
on a trading missionto the kingdom of
siam when she wastragically lost at sea.

470
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,440
The only known artifactof this journey
is the journalof the ship's first mate,

471
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,210
which was discovered amongthe artifacts of pirates
on l'île snte marie,madagascarseven years later.

472
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,330
The contents of this journalhave

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,490
I don't kn howto reach her,and
her number'sbeen disconnected.

501
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,790
there was a time when if
you'dhave asked her to marry you,

502
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,430
I'm certainshe would've said yes.

503
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,390
Fortunately...

504
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,730
your cowardicewon out instead.

505
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,310
I take it you've hadsecond thoughts.

506
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,150
and you'd like herto
give you another chance.

507
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,010
Why do you hate me so much?

508
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,250
it's not me who hates you.

509
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,640
here's her address.

510
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,600
I'll let her tell you herself.

511
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,030
desmond.

512
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,990
I know.

513
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,620
It's getting hardeR.

514
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,910
It starts happening faster,too.

515
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,770
Come on.Let's move.

516
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,350
Hey,how did this happento you?

517
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:26,280
We were anchored here,waiting for
our orders,bored out of our minds.

518
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,750
Me and brandon--he's one of the crew
members-- we--we took outthe ship's tender.

519
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,630
We just wantedto see the island.

520
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,030
But brandonstarted acting
crazy,so we had to turn around.

521
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,940
Where is he?

522
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,300
In a body bag.

523
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,340
there.

524
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,600
who did this?

525
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,230
You got me.

526
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:00,170
But when the captain
finds out,I feel sor--

527
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,590
after your call,someone has to
tell me precisely what is going on.

528
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,630
Can you fix it,brother?

529
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,680
I need a minute.

530
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,780
Do you have the numberto make the call?

531
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,900
george?Wake up,brother.Wake up.

532
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,510
You've gotta come
back.You've gotta come back.

533
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,930
Desmond,do younow the number?

534
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,270
- No
- Well,you'd better remember it.

535
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,280
It's 2004.

536
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,530
I didn't realize it wasalmost christmas.

537
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,160
It's been...

538
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,010
desmond.

539
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,560
No!

540
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,330
I can'T...

541
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,310
get...

542
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:03,740
back.

543
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,720
what happened to him?

544
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,180
The same thingthat's gonna happen to me.

545
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,690
 desmond?

546
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,470
What are you doing here?

547
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,490
I had to--I mean,I tried to call
you,but you--you disconnected your phone.

548
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,550
Yeah,because I moved.

549
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
Look,I don't know if
you'regetting the signals,desmond,

550
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,370
but I'm trying to makea clean break
from you,so if you don't mind,I'm gonna--

551
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,490
wait,wait,wait,wait.Pen,please wait.

552
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,310
I just--I just need to get
your new phone number,okay?

553
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,300
Why would I give you that?

554
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,100
BecauseI-I made a huge mistake.

555
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,620
I-I should never have broken
up with you,and--and--and...

556
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,160
I know--I know that
now,and--and I'm sorry and--

557
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,460
- oh,don'T.Just don't--
- I understand,and--

558
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,380
and I-I know it's--it's
too lateto change things,

559
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,380
but I needto tell you something,and--and
I need youto listen to me,and...

560
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,710
look,I-I know it's
gonnasound ridiculous,but...

561
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,170

562
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,480
I need you to listento me.

563
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,460
Just say what you
needto say and then go.

564
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,840
I know this doesn'tmake any sense,

565
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:23,210
because it doesn'tmake any sense
to me,but eight years from now,I...

566
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,290
I-I need to call you,and I can't
call youif I don't have your number.

567
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,070

568
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,140
Look,penny,just--just
give me your number.

569
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,880
I-I know--I know
I've ruined things.

570
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,890
I know you think things are
overbetween us,but they're not.

571
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:40,140
If there's any part of you
thatstill believes in us,just...

572
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,520
just give me your number.

573
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,250
And what's to say you wouldn'tcall
me tonight or tomorrow--

574
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,490
I won't call...

00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,800
for eight years.

576
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,300
December the 24th,2004.

577
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:57,010
Christmas eve.

578
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,090

579
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,390
Please,pen.

580
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,420
If I give you the number,will you leave?

581
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,820
Aye.

582
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,110
7946-0893.

583
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,360
7946-0893.7946...

584
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,690
all that,and you're
notgonna write it down?

585
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,910
it wouldn't do any good.

586
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,240
You have to keep that number.

587
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,190
- You can't change your number for eight years.
- Get out!

588
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,860
Just--just remember,december

589
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,540
Look,pen,if--if you stillcare
about me,you have to answer.

590
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,460
I'm not crazy,penny!

591
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,040
You have to believe me!

592

594
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,340
7946-0893.

595
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,450
It's a london number.

596
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,070
Excellent timing.

597
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,390
The patch is done,but I don't
know how longthe battery will last.

598
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,140
I hope she's there.

599
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,700
