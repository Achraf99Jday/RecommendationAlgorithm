1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,230
You killed naomi!

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,740
She wants her people to come here.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,790
And trust me,when they do,we
had better be far away from here.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,900
If you want to live,you
need to come with me.

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,130
who are you?

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,220
Daniel faraday.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,520
I'm here to rescue you.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,580
so this is the team?

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,550
These are the wrong people
for a mission like this.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,360
None of them have field
experience,military training.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,220
You can't just drop them in unprotected.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,990
There's only so much I can do.

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,790
Where's the chopper? Where did it crash?

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,030
crash? The hell kind
of pilot you think I am?

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,440
I put her down safe and
sound right over there.

17
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,850
Get up. You're coming with us.

18
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,090
Well,we need to stay where we
are so that they can find us.

19
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,260
See,there's your problem.

20
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,530
We don't want to be found.

21
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,130
You wanted to know why we're
here? I'll tell you why we're here.

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,080
We're here for benjamin linus.

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,110
Now where is he?

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,640
did ben ever mention anything
about knowing anyone off the island?

25
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,600
- You're sure of that?
- No.

26
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,630
Look,this is real simple.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you know where he is or don't you?

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,930
What do you want with him?

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,360
I wanna locate him.

30
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,120
The people who hired me told
me his name's benjamin linus.

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,470
They gave me this picture,and
that's all they told me.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,130
They said,"find him."

33
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:42,220
And for what they're paying me,I don't
need to know anything else. Do you?

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,820
You want Ben?

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,250
Okay,he's with locke and your friend...

36
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,130
- charlotte.
- Charlotte.

37
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,730
Locke's got her,too,and
we know where he's heading.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,150
Locke's the guy that killed Naomi?

39
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,050
Give me back my gun, Shephard.

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,370
You want your gun back.

41
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,920
I want answers.

42
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,080
You don't trust me.

43
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,140
I don't trust you.

44
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,870
{\a6}N.I'll always be with you.R.G.

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,470
In fact,you're supposed to be dead.

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,120
But am I asking a billion questions? No.

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,790
We both have the same
problem-- this locke guy.

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,660
Even if locke has your friend,you
can't just waltz in there and grab her.

49
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,340
They're armed.

50
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,210
Well,how about that? So are we.

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,860
- So why don't we move out and-
- you're not going anywhere.

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,600
Will that helicopter fly?

53
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,590
It's what she does.

54
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,920
Then you can take me to your ship.

55
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,860
Sayid,wait a second.

56
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,470
We did call these people to get
us off this island,didn't we?

57
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Well?

58
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,320
I burned a lot of fuel cong
in. I can't carry much weight.

59
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,640
I'll take three of ya.

60
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,150
In case you zoned out while
you were tweezing your goatee,

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,360
one of these yahoos
took charlotte prisoner.

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,740
I can bring her back safely.

63
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,110
And if I do...

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,840
will you take me to the ship?

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,440
Absolutely.

66
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,780
You bring charlotte back safe,

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,600
and I will take you off this island.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,230
Good morning.

69
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,480
Good morning.

70
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,700
It's a long walk to the next hole.

71
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,060
Do you need a ride?

72
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,990
Thank you,but no. My ball is right here.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,820
You know,you are the first person
I've seen out here all morning.

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,920
I believe we're paying quite a
premium for that kind of privacy.

75
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,500
Indeed we are.

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,360
Is this your first
time in the seychelles?

77
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,840
I'd use the 5-iron.

78
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,530
I think I'll stick with the 7.

79
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,490
Tell you what.

80
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,470
50 euros ss mine goes
closer to the pin with a 5.

81
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,060
Let's make it 100.

82
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,100
Eccellente.

83
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,200
Amazing,huh,how a wager makes
just about anything more fun?

84
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,650
not bad.

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,220
Not bad.

86
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
so...

87
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,010
what do you do for a living,my friend?

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,220
I do nothing.

89
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,220
"Nothing" doesn't pay
for a vacation here.

90
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,700
I was the recipient
of a large settlement.

91
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,740
Corporate merger?

92
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,440
Actually,a plane crash.

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,120
Oceanic airlines
flight 8-1-5.

94
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,590
I'm sayid jarrah.

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,590
One of the oceanic six.

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,900
Ah,that'S...

97
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,830
that's--that's
amazing.

98
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,820
I remember reading all about it.

99
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,250
Take your shot,my friend.

100
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,980
it appears you were
right about the 5-iron.

101
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,670
Well,uh...

102
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,060
enjoy your round,and,uh,don't
worry about the wager.

103
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,190
All in good fun.

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,900
No,you won. Low me to pay you.

105
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,790
It's fine,thank you. It'S...

106
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,220
I insist,mr. Avellino.

Is this seat free?

111
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,070
Where would you like to go?

112
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,900
"is it free?" Was the
full extent of my german.

113
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,890
what are you looking for?

114
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,010
I love europe. Everyone speaks english.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,290
I'm looking for potsdamer platz.

116
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,950
Well,you don't need aap.

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,410
It's one block down,right
across the street.

118
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,060
Thank you.

119
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,680
I'm elsa.

120
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,760
Sayid.

121
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,740
could I have an espresso,please?

122
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,720
What sort of business
brings you to berlin?

123
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,730
I'm a headhunter.

124
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,360
A corporate recruiter.

125
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,970
And what do you do?

126
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,190
My employer an economist.

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,570
He works in emerging markets.

128
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,250
Actually,I-I don't really
understand what he does,

129
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,410
which doesn't matter since
all I do is shop for him.

130
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,200
And if this goes off,I'm
at his side instantly,

131
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,890
which is wonderful since he's only
in berlin once or twice a year.

132
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,330
Which is why you're enjoying
a luxuriously long miay coffee.

133
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes.

134
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,640
Thank you.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
do I...

136
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,560
know you from somewhere?

137
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,870
I'll tell you exactly
where you know me from...

138
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,820
if you let me take you to dinner.

139
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,700
this is the restaurant
you're taking me to tonight.

140
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,620
8:00.

141
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
Well... if you can find it.

142
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,070
hello?

143
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,180
- I made contact.
- Good.

144
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,590
take a look at this.

145
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,970
Naomi had it with her.

146
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,530
She was looking fodesmond.

147
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,370
Whatever their real agenda is,it's
clear they're not sharing it.

148
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,640
Maybe desmond can shed
some light on this.

149
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,430
How long would it take to
get to the beach and back?

150
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,650
Couple of hours.

151
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,570
You mind?

152
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,240
Anything i can do to help.

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,780
SaD.

154
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,630
So how we gonna do this?

155
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
You're not the best candidate
for this kind of mission.

156
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,250
Well,and what kind of mission is that?

157
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm going to make locke release charlotte,and
I'm going to do it without any bloodshed.

158
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,430
As opposed to the way I'd do it?

159
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,960
The last time you encountered him,you put
a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.

160
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,680
That's not good diplomacy.

161
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,370
Jarrah.

162
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,820
You think you're going
after charlotte without me?

163
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,250
Of course not.

164
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,510
Well,good.

165
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,310
Is tre anything else?

166
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,920
Yeah. Givee my gun back.

167
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,550
We leave in ten minutes.

168
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,930
Ready to give us a name,gizmo?

169
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,860
He's not gonna tell you who
his spy is on their boat,james.

170
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,160
yeah? Why not?

171
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,130
because that's the only thing
that's keeping him alive.

172
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,060
Well,here's an idea.

173
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:03,180
Why don't we take a gun,point it to his big
toe and send that little piggy to market?

174
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,260
And if he still doesn't want to tell
us,we'll move on to the roast beef.

175
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,470
Now why don't we do that?

176
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,070
Because then we'd have to carry him.

177
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,850
Hey,john,how much further is it?

178
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,100
I-I need to feed aaron.

179
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,970
It should be here... the cabin.

180
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,210
Maybe we got turned around.

181
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,810
It could be anywhere.

182
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,340
No,it was here.

183
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,780
Well,what's in this cabin
that's so important anyway?

184
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,920
John's looking for somebody
to tell him what to do next.

185
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,340
I guess I was mistaken. It doesn'T...

186
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,480
doesn't matter.

187
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,880
Pl the same. We keep movin'.

188
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,700
The barracks aren't far.

189
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,210
If her team is with jack's group,they
know we're going to the barracks.

190
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,880
yeah,and red here was wearing a vest.

191
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,510
Which means her posse's gonna come
expecting themselves a gunfight.

192
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,200
If all they want is her,maybe
we should just let hero.

193
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,500
I mean,I thought we
were just gonna go hide.

194
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,730
Why do we need to take prisoners?

195
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,650
We're keeping her because
she's gonna be valuable.

196
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,900
How is she gonna be valuable?

197
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,860
He means as a hostage,luv.

198
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,140
No,this is notwhat I signed up for.

199
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,490
What did you sign up for hugo?

200
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,890
Look,I'm just
saying I think we--

201
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,510
if we let her go,they'll look
at it as a sign of good faith.

202
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,860
They'll look at it as an act of
foolishness,which is what it would be.

203
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,450
I'm just trying to come up
with some sort of comprose--

204
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,160
we're beyond compromise.

205
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,490
And right now,hugo,I'm
making the decision.

206
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,560
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

207
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,240
kinda sucks,huh?

208
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,370
What's that?

209
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,610
Being told not to come along.

210
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,490
now you know what it
feels like to be me.

211
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,440
Does that mean I should wait
20 minutes and ago anyway?

212
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,170
touch?

213
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,360
You should go with them,kate.

214
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,180
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

215
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,920
What,don't you trust sayid?

216
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,010
I don't trust locke.

217
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,470
So what's preventing him from
doing to me what he did to naomi?

218
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,060
Sawyer won't let him.

219
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,470
Got room for one more?

220
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,940
Oh,yeah,she gets a gun.

221
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,530
The gun's a last resort,kate

222
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,310
you give locke that same speech?

223
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,650
Let move out.

224
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,290
This guy sayid--
where's he from?

225
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,570
Iraq.

226
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,320
Iraq?

227
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,780
So he's just gonna go
and work everything out?

228
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,730
What was he,a diplomat?

229
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,150
no.

230
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,050
No,he was a torturer.

231
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,290
Naomi-- were
you close to her?

232
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,250
Nope.

233
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,410
Met her on the boat.

234
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,240
You don't seem particularly
affected by her death.

235
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,260
Sure I'm affected.

236
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,710
She was hot,and I dug her accent.

237
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,970
Nice.

238
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,630
And this
woman--charlotte.

239
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,730
You don't really care about her,do you?

240
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,150
Define "care "

241
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,970
so much for camaraderie.

242
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,840
Ah,gee,who's the one going after
one of their crash buddies with guns?

243
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,200
Actually,I do care about locke.

244
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,590
Maybe you can tell me how he managed to
split your happy little family in half.

245
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,780
There was a fundamental debate as to whether
your people were coming to rescue us or kill us.

246
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,340
And which side did you land on?

247
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,980
I'll let you know when I decide.

248
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,690
You look fantastic.

249
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,860
this is why I wanted to
take you to the opera.

250
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,810
If a man can't wear his tuxedo
by the fifth date,why bother?

251
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,440
you know what?

252
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,820
I'm not bringing it.

253
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,640
If tonight's the night
he calls,so be it.

254
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,050
I'll carry iT.

255
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,000
If he does call,I don't
want you fired over me.

256
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,860
You should tell your employer
that there is newer technology.

257
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,150
Well,I've tried.

258
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,220
He's very old-fashioned.

259
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,980
You know how bosses can be.

260
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,880
Do you have a boss?

261
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,890
Everyone has a boss,lsa.

262
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,580
Come on. We don't want to be late.

263
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,840
Why are you still here?

264
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,150
I mean,when we met,you said you
would only be in berlin for one week.

265
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,170
The job I'm ons proving harder
to accomplish than I thought.

266
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,080
right.

267
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:23,360
I was hoping it was because of me.

268
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
let's go.

269
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,280
Strauss awaits.

270
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,890
What's his story?

271
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,160
Daniel?

272
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,540
Ah,couldn't tell you.

273
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,300
Half the stuff he says
is way over my head.

274
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,860
the other half goes way,way over.

275
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,690
Hey,uh,frank?

276
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,900
Can
I,uh-- ooh.

277
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,170
Sorry to interrupt.

278
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,840
- May I please use the phone just for a second?
- For what?

279
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,240
I just wanna call regina on the
boat,'cause I figure since we're waiting,

280
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,650
maybe I could
just,you know,try to--

281
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,480
what is it,daniel?

282
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,940
I'd just like to do an experiment.

283
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,740
- Just--just
a- - okay.

284
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,310
You just keep it to at
science stuff,all right?

285
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,950
Yeah.

286
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,350
If minkowski gets on
there,you hang up right away.

287
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,580
Yeah. Thank you.Thank you.

288
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,290
hello?

289
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,520
Regina? Hey--hi,it's
dan.Hang on.

290
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,780
Can you hear me?

291
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,970
Yeah.

292
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,000
Yeah? Okay.Hang on.

293
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,230
I'm,uh,all... yes.

294
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,750
I am all set here. I have a fix.

295
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,170
Are you locked in?

296
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,520
Getting your signal pretty clear.

297
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,580
Okay,great. Then...okay.

298
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,280
Fire the pload.

299
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,010
Payload away!

300
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,410
Don't sweat it. He does this kind
of stuff on the boat all the time.

301
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,500
40 kilometers to beacon.

302
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,080
35 kilometers to beacon.

303
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,310
30 kilometers to beacon.

304
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,810
25 kilometers to beacon.

305
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,360
20 kilometers to beacon.

306
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,030
15 kilometers to beacon.

307
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,350
10 kilometers to beacon.

308
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,620
- Regina?
- 5 kilometers to beacon.

309
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,620
I don't have it.

310
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,760
That'S... weird.

311
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,560
that is far more than weird.

312
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,100
what's with the swing set?
These people have day care?

313
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,600
You think they're here yet?

314
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,400
Let's find out.

315
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,750
it'soming from in there.

316
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,630
hurley,what happened?

317
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,680
They left me.

318
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,030
Locke's gone off the reservation,man.

319
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,920
I mean,he took this one chick hostage,

320
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,230
he said walt was the one who
told him to kill this other chick,

321
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,470
- and--and--and
he- - walt?

322
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,590
Dude,don't ask.

323
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,870
I was,like,just trying to argue
with him so he would just,like,

324
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,800
you
know,chill,but,uh--

325
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,360
how about you stop babbling,just
tell us what happened to them?

326
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,360
Where are they?

327
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,330
Who are you?

328
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,580
Where the hell did they go,tubby?

329
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,590
Oh,awesome.

330
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,110
The ship sent us another sawyer.

331
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,510
Hurley,where did they go?

332
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,260
Look,I guess they were too busy
tying me up to tell me. I don't know.

333
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,770
And so they all left,all together?

334
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,000
Yeah,they were freaked.

335
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,070
Locke said that the peop on the ship were
here to rescue charlotte and then kill us.

336
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,220
So... are you?

337
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,160
Not yet.

338
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,420
Did they say anything that
suggested where they were going next?

339
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,910
Uh,locke said they were gonna go
by ben's house before they took off.

340
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,770
Why would he go there?

341
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,180
For all I know,they could've
locked ben up in the closet,too.

342
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,670
Where's ben's house?

343
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,690
Mind if I ask you a question?

344
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,300
Shoot.

345
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,840
The red sox really win the series?

346
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,540
Hey,don't get me started
on that,all right?

347
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,630
My dad's from the bronx.
I bleed yankee blue.

348
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,690
I can't believe it's been a
hundred days since I've seen a game.

349
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,360
it's the payload!

350
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,540
it's finally here.

351
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,480
What is that?

352
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,640
It's a rocket.

353
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,210
oh,no.

354
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,000
31 minutes.

355
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,930
Oh,no.

356
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,130
This is not good.

357
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,630
Your friends are back.

358
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,960
well...

359
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,980
look at that.

360
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,950
Look for anything that might
show where they've gone.

361
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,290
I'll start in here.

362
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,240
Sayid!

363
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,110
Don't worry. Kate's fine.

364
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,210
Good job,hugo.

365
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,020
Sorry,dude.

366
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,610
I'm sorry,sayid.

367
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,260
Nothing personal.

368
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,560
Where's locke?

369
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,010
He's talking to that angry chinese guy.

370
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,430
I'm not going to hurt you,hurley.

371
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,450
I saw you snap that guy's neck with that
break-dancing thing you do with your legs.

372
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,850
I think I'll hang back here.

373
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,080
well...

374
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:58,370
I guess they're running
out of jail space.

375
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,210
I lost a dollar,you know.

376
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,430
How'd you manage that?

377
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,620
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid
enough to fall for your friend as bait.

378
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,370
what do you know about friendship?

379
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,420
I know it's no use having
friends you can't trust.

380
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
so,what,I'm your prisoner?

381
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,020
If that sorta thing turns you on.

382
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,760
What are you doing here with locke?

383
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,890
I'm not with him.

384
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,820
Yeah,you are,james.

385
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,030
Then what are you doing with jack?

386
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,600
I went with jack because I believe
he can get us off this island.

387
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,500
Then I guess that's the
difference between us.

388
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,320
I ain't lookin' to leave.

389
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,320
Why not?

390
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,830
'Cause I ain't got
nothin' back there for me.

391
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,620
And what's here that's so much better?

392
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,200
Why do you wanna go back,kate?

393
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,850
Seem to recall you being shuttled
off to jail before we landed here.

394
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,100
So if you think there's anything waitin'
for you back home other than handcuffs,

395
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,520
then you really don'know
how the world works.

396
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,210
I mean,look around us,freckles.

397
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,240
We got roofs over our heads...

398
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,970
electricity,showers,beds.

399
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,370
How long,sawyer?

400
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,010
How long do you think we can play house?

401
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,540
why don't we find out?

402
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,650
Iced tea.

403
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,020
I thought you might be thirsty.

404
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,150
I'm thirsty.

405
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,780
I'm sorry about all
the theatrics,but,uh,

406
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:33,360
I didn't know how many of you there
would be or whether you'd be armed.

407
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,220
I had to... cor my bases.

408
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,160
What have you done with miles and kate?

409
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:41,970
Kate's with sawyer,and
miles is somewhere else.

410
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,520
He's fine.

411
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,100
All I did was ask him some questions.

412
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,790
- Did he answer any?
- No.

413
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,680
Did you have more luck
with the woman you captured?

414
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,240
Not particularly.

415
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,810
then why don't you turn her over to me?

416
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,710
And why would I do that?

417
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,400
I agree that these people are liars,and
they're certainly not here to rescue us.

418
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,100
But if I return safely with
charlotte,they'll take me to their ship.

419
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,330
It's our best chance at finding out
who they are and what they really want.

420
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,110
Well,then,I can save you
a lot of trouble,sayid,

421
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,890
because ben says he's
got a spy on the boat.

422
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,630
Who?

423
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,620
It's a secret.

424
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,570
Forgive me,but the day I start trusting
him is the day I would have sold my soul.

425
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,460
Give me charlotte,allow
me to do things my way,

426
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,150
or a war is coming which we
will both be powerless to stop.

427
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,020
Why would I give you
charlotte for nothing?

428
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,410
Oh,I think you misunderstood me.

429
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,520
I never expected you to
give her to me for nothing.

430
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,990
- should we get dressed?
- no.

431
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,740
well,we're gonna have to get out
of this bed at a certain point.

432
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,830
Why?

433
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:18,890
Well,for one thing,because I know that eventually
you're gonna have to go to that job of yours--

434
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,890
you know,the one that
you never talk about.

435
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,550
There's nothing to talk
about. It's just a job.

436
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,520
I know nothing about you.

437
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,290
I understand you don't want to talk
about the crash,what happened to you.

438
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,660
But what about life now?

439
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,540
What about you?

440
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,990
That's what you do when
you're in love,right?

441
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,940
In love?

442
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,200
Yeah.

443
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,470
Okay.

444
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,180
No more secrets.

445
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,970
What do you want to know?

446
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,930
he's here... my boss.

447
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,720
I,um...

448
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,890
I have to go.

449
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,710
Now?

450
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,210
where?

451
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,650
hotel adlon.

452
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,040
Where's my dress?

453
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,910
Elsa?

454
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,900
You have to leave berlin.

455
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,200
what?

456
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,000
You can't be here anymore.

457
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,310
what do you
mean?Why would I--

458
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,730
people will be asking questions soon
about what happened to your employer.

459
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,050
And you can't be around to answer them.

460
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,010
My employer?

461
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,920
This... this is about my boss?

462
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,640
Who are you?

463
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,310
- It has nothing to
do with how- - the caf?

464
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,950
you meant to meet me there?

465
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,840
You used me to get to my boss?

466
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:51,070
What did you say--people
will ask what happened to him?

467
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,130
It's best you don't know.

468
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,690
You're gonna kill him?

469
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,830
You're gonna kill him?

470
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,230
do you even know him?

471
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,560
His na is on a list.

472
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,870
A list? What list?

473
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,220
You--you
have a list?

474
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,190
It's my employer'S.

475
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,140
Who that?

476
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,460
It doesn't matter who he is!

477
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,900
Soou just kill people 'cause your list?

478
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,870
Innocent people?

479
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,730
The man you are working
for is not an economist.

480
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,810
You were supposed to
page me at ten-thirty

481
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,110
No, I don't kill him

482
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,800
He's not going to give me the name now

483
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,030
Why should I keep him alive?

484
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,340
No, He had no idea

485
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,280
All right,all right

486
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,090
I'll bring him to you

487
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,710
Leave the hotel

488
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,600
I'll meet you at the safe house

489
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,460
what do u
think you're--

490
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,940
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪

491
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,530
Why was naomi carrying
this picture of me?

492
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,110
Look,man,you gotta understand somethin'.

493
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,260
She was senior management.

494
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,970
It's not like we hung around
the cafeteria together.

495
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,730
She stayed
on her own--

496
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,370
look,naomi told me
yopeople were hired by her.

497
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:16,850
So you look me right in the eye and tell me
u've never seen or heard of penelope widmore.

498
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,420
fine.

499
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,190
You don't want to tell me the truth?

500
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,560
I'll find someone who will.

501
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,940
See,when that takes off,I'm on it.

502
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,300
He's back.

503
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,580
Where's kate?

504
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,750
She decided to stay.

505
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,790
what happened to miles?

506
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
I traded him.

507
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,470
Traded him?

508
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,120
I promised you charlotte. Here she is.

509
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,440
You cheated.

510
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,340
Did I?

511
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,220
Yes,you did.

512
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,650
Lucky for you,that guy's
nothing but a pain in my ass.

513
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,380
- You all right?
- All right,that giveus room for one more.

514
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,570
Charlotte?

515
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,550
go back,with all the
fun I'm having here?

516
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,060
No.

517
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,190
I've got work to do.

518
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,480
Seat's yours if you want it,daniel.

519
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,940
I--no,thank
you.

520
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,230
I think I should probably
just stay with charlotte.

521
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:48,480
All rit.

522
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,050
Frank. Frank?

523
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,490
Just--just...
just one thing.

524
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:02,120
just be sure that you follow the same
exact bearing that we came in on,okay?

525
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:03,370
No matter what.

526
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,040
By that,I mean no matter what. Just...

527
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,370
just stay on it.

528
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,000
Roger that.

529
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,630
Be careful.

530
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,390
I don't have to talk you out of coming.

531
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,620
As much as I like helicopter rides,I
think you got this one under control.

532
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,660
Wish me luck.

533
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,700
Good luck.

534
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,930
Send me a postcard.

535
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,710
You said we have room for one more?

536
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,080
Yeah. Why?

537
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,780
You should bring naomi home.

538
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,840
take your shirt off.

539
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,820
is she dead?

540
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,290
Yes.

541
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,140
Why didn't she kill you?

542
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,860
she was trying to get
information from me.

543
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,510
What sort of information?

544
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,450
She wanted to know who I worked for.

545
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,350
She wanted to know about you.

546
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,400
Of course she did.

547
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,120
Why are you crying?

548
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,030
Because it hurts,or because you
were stupid enough to care for her?

549
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,500
These people don't
deserve our sympathies.

550
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:42,860
Need I remind you what they did the last time
you thought with your heart instead of your gun?

551
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,950
You used that to recruit
me to killing for you.

552
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,150
You wanna protect your
friends or not,sayid?

553
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:57,520
I have another name for you.

554
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,910
But they know I'm after them now.

555
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,630
Good.

556
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,890
