1
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,570
these are the last two eggs.

2
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,530
From my own bookshelf?

3
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,840
Help you pass the time.

4
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,230
I've already read it.

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,600
You might catch something you
missed the second time around.

6
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,260
Why did you move me from
the rec room down here?

7
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,090
I wanted you under my own roof.

8
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,850
Where are you keeping
your other prisoner?

9
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,930
Miles,is it?

10
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,140
Oh,you don't want to share.

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,850
Actually,I was hoping you would share, Ben, seeing
as you claim to have a spy on his ship.

12
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,810
I feel for you, John. I really do.

13
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,290
You keep hitting dead ends.

14
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,030
You couldn't find the cabin.

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,700
You can't make contact with Jacob.

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,920
You're so desperate to figure out what
to do next,you're even asking me for help.

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,680
So here we are,just like old times...

18
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,230
except I'm locked in a different room.

19
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,980
And you're more lost than you ever were.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,590
I know what you're trying to do.

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,090
It's not gonnaorK.

22
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,980
Excellent, John.

23
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,550
You're evolving.

24
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,240
Done with your breakfast?

25
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,720
what's tl t alabout?

26
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,140
Who knows?

27
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,150
It's locke.

28
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,000
Mornin',ladies.

29
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,660
Good morning.

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,260
Mornin'.

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,720
Mmm,coffee smells good.

32
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,530
Well...why don't i go make you a cup?

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,380
Kinda weird,ain't it?

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,490
Sittin' on porches,drinking
coffee out of mugs.

35
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,970
Anyway,I found some
clothes about your size.

36
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,000
Hung 'em in a closet.

37
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,260
So after I kick out hugo...

38
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm not moving in with you,james.

39
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,930
Well... then why did you stay?

40
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,330
That's none of your business.

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,400
Oh,you got a secret agenda,huh?

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, if you're
spying for Jack--

43
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,420
I'm not spying for anyone.

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,290
- So why don't you tell me-
- because I don't trust you.

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,710
This is about the pregnancy thing.

46
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,620
- James...
- yeah?

47
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,240
Go home.

48
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,010
Okay,fine.

49
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,940
See you later,then.

50
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,110
you ready?

51
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,050
Is there a back entrance?

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,750
Yeah,but you're going in the front
door with your head held high,okay?

53
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,660
Yeah. Okay.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,840
Let's do this.

55
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,420
why'd you do it,kate?

56
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,350
coming through.

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,330
Hey,folks,we're not making any statements
or answering any questions right now.

58
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,590
Excuse us.

59
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,300
the people against
katherine anne austen.

60
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,260
The honorable arthur
galzethron presiding.

61
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,680
The bailiff will read the counts.
Will the defendant please rise?

62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:05,250
katherine anne austen,you are charged with
fraud,arson,assault on a federal officer,

63
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,060
assault with a deadly weapon,grand
larceny,grand theft auto

64
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,450
and murder in the first degree.

65
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Miss austen,how do you plead?

66
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,380
Not guilty.

67
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,520
thus entered.

68
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,910
I'll now hear argument on bail.

69
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,510
Your honor,we are requesting that the defendant be
remanded into custody for the duration of the trial.

70
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,030
Your honor,my client's been
free pending arraignment.

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,460
Now suddenly she's a flight risk?

72
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,360
She's the very definition
of a flight risk.

73
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,790
She has one of the most
recognizable faces in america.

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,030
Where is she going to run?

75
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,370
Miss austen,based on your prior
history,I'm inclined to agree wh the people.

76
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,420
You are hereby remanded into federal
custody for the duration of your trial.

77
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,350
- Your honor,my- - bailiff,please
take the defendant into custody.

78
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,190
sorry.

Albuquer-que?

83
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,450
Too hot.

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
New york?

85
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,180
Too many people.

86
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,770
More than Seoul?

87
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,220
What's wrong with Seoul?

88
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,120
Sun,we're going to leave
this island any moment now.

89
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,610
I learn english...

90
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,400
for you...

91
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,070
to live... in...america.

92
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,580
I want...

93
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,690
to raise my baby at home.

94
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,050
in Korea

95
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,640
You mean our baby.

96
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,660
hey, look! Jack!

97
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,140
- Jack!
- you're okay!

98
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,820
hey,man.

99
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,380
This is,uh,charlotte and dan.

100
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,540
Their helicopter already took sayid
and desmond back to their freighter.

101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,070
They can make arrangements to
get all of us off this island.

102
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,710
Where's kate?

103
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,230
She stayed with locke.

104
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,570
hello,kate.

105
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,000
Is that blood?

106
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,380
I just... killed a chicken.

107
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,910
What can I do for ya?

108
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,530
I wanna talk to miles.
Where you keeping him?

109
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,810
Why do you need to talk to him?

110
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,060
Well,that's personal.

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,200
No.

112
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,900
And what gives you the right
to decide whether or not¡ª

113
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,920
you may think this is a democracy, Kate, because
of the way Jack ran things.

114
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,470
But this is not a democracy.

115
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,670
Then I guess that
makes it a dictatorship.

116
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,120
If I was a dictator,I would just
shoot you and go about my day.

117
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,800
Dinner's at 6:00 if you're hungry.

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,330
Hey,hurley! Wait.

119
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,370
- You bringing that to miles?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,920
- Yeah,locke asked me to do it.
- Cool.

121
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,430
That dude creeps me out.

122
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,990
He's still in the rec room,right?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,630
No,I moved him to the boathouse that...

124
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,110
you just totally
scooby-doo'd me,didn't you?

125
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,760
Sorry.

126
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,230
You're not gonna let him go,are ya?

127
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,830
No. No,I promise.

128
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,590
Just don't tell locke it was me.

129
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,060
so the arab traded you,too,huh?

130
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,400
Do you know who I am?

131
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,300
Excuse me?

132
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,690
Do you know who I am?

133
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,290
Do you know what I did?

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,090
What did you do?

135
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,520
Answer the question.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,220
Okay.

137
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,050
I'll tell you what you want to know,but
you gotta do something for me first.

138
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,500
I'm not letting you go.

139
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,210
I don't want to be let go.

140
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,200
I am exactly where I want to be.

141
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,560
What i want...

142
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:13,580
is one minute... of someone's time.

143
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:19,420
You bring him to me,and I will tell
you everything I know about you.

144
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,390
Who?

145
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,640
Who do you think?

146
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,830
you okay?

147
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,750
Yeah,I'm fine.

148
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,290
Listen,the D.A.'S decided
to try this case herself,

149
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,330
which means they're gonna
do e full court press,

150
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,100
and we need to start
talking about cutting a deal.

151
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,230
What kind of deal?

152
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,460
Honestly,my best gus,I'd say she'll take
a 15-year sentence,and you serve seven.

153
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,470
No way.

154
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,980
If you go torial,kate,you're
looking at 20 years on each count,

155
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,310
not to mention a life
sentence on the murder charge.

156
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,840
No.

157
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,950
Kate,you confessed toour mother
that you killed your father,

158
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,980
and now she's their star witness.

159
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,680
So you tell me-- what
am I supposed to do?

160
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,100
How am I supposed to win this thing?

161
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,350
Put me on thstand.

162
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,340
And take a chance with
the D.A. Crossing you?No.

163
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,010
Way I see it,we've got one shot at this.

164
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,570
What's that?

165
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,610
We make it about character,not
about what you did or didn't do,

166
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,130
but about who you are.

167
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,450
What do you mean,who I am?

168
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,170
I want him in the courtroom.

169
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,470
Absolutely not.

170
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,420
We need him,kate. It'll
generate tremendous sympathy.

171
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:47,900
Duncan,listen to me.

172
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,080
You are  not bringing him in here.

173
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,310
All right,you wanna make this
about me,about my character? Fine.

174
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,230
But you are not using my son.

175
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,500
maybe we should try a number
other than the boat,like...

177
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,680
Nothing.

178
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,900
We're just having some trouble
getting ahold of their boat.

179
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,550
You haven't heard from sayid?

180
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,610
You said they lete yesrday.

181
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,920
and I'm sure they're fine.

182
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,130
What if locke was right?

183
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,970
What if these people
are here to hurt us?

184
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,650
Locke has no idea whatdoe's ing.

185
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,270
Then why is kate with him?

186
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,720
you sure he's got ben in his basement?

187
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,060
I saw rousseau take
him in there last night.

188
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,970
Does locke ever go out?

189
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,180
No. He's been in there cooking all day.

190
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,670
He invited us all over for dinner.

191
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,040
oh,can you get aaronfor me?

192
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,280
just pick him up and
rock him a little bit.

193
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,830
yeah,I'm just...

194
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,000
not very good with babies.

195
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,370
I wouldn't want him to get more upset.

196
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,440
here,I got him.

197
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,880
it's okay.

198
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,270
Here we go,muffin. Yeah.There we go.

199
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,330
You're so good with him.

200
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,320
what?

201
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,310
Just the last thing I ever thought
I'd be good at is being a mum.

202
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,120
You know,you should try it sometime.

203
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,340
Hey,aaron. Come on,sweetie.

204
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,720
please rise.

205
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,230
Court is now in session.

206
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,110
Please be seated.

207
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,430
Don't fire me,okay?

208
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,700
What?

209
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,010
We got killed in the opening.

210
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,290
I had to do this.

211
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,980
Does the defense have a witness?

212
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,240
Yes,we do,your honor.

213
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,730
The defense calls dr. Jack
shepherd to the witness stand.

214
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,490
your honor,I'd like to renew my objection
to this witness on the basis of relevance.

215
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,150
And I'm going to renew my
overruling of your objection.

216
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,930
You are to be aware that this
witness did not meet the defendant

217
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,640
until after the alleged crimes
she is being charged with.

218
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,650
He's to be viewed as a
character witness only.

219
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,220
Proceed.

220
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,150
Please raise your right hand.

221
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,270
Do you swear to tell the
truth,the whole truth,

222
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,630
and nothing but the
truth so help you god?

223
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
Yes.

224
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,560
Dr. Shephard...

225
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,630
could you please tell the ladies
and gentlemen of the jury¡ª

226
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,800
if there are any of you who don't read
newspapers or the internet or watch television...

227
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,760
how you met the defendant?

228
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,560
on september 22,2004,kate...

229
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,850
miss austen and i were both
passengers on oceanic flight 815,

230
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,380
which crash-landed on an
island in the south pacific.

231
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,560
Were you aware that miss austen
was a fugitive being transported

232
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,270
by a united states marshal on that
flight to los angeles for trial?

233
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,980
I did learn that eventually,yes.

234
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,710
From the U.S. Marshal?

235
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,630
No,the marshal died in the crash.

236
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Uh,I never spoke to him.

237
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,080
Miss austen told me.

238
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,210
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty?

239
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,980
no. Never.

240
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,270
Well,it seems like a
reasonable question. Why not?

241
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,650
I just assumed that there'd
been some kind of mistake.

242
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,280
And why would you think that?

243
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,760
Only eight of us survived the crash.

244
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,840
We landed in the water.

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,460
I was hurt pretty badly.

246
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,220
In fact,if it weren't for her,I
would have never made it to the shore.

247
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,410
She took care of me.

248
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,160
She took care of
all of us.She--

249
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,990
she gave us first
aid,water,found food,made shelter.

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,950
- She tried to save the other
two,but they didn't- - stop.

251
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,690
Miss austen,please sit down.

252
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,930
This has nothing to do
with... with anything.

253
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,920
This is my trial,and I don't
want him to say anything else.

254
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,730
It's fine. I have no
more questions,your honor.

255
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,120
miss dunbrook,your witness.

256
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,680
That was very moving,dr. Shephard.

257
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,280
I only have one question for
you-- do you love the defendant?

258
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,120
Objection.

259
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,300
you opened this door,mr.
Forrester. M going to allow it.

260
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,740
Dr. Shephard?

261
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,180
Do you love miss austen?

262
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,210
No.

263
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,220
not anymore.

264
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,080
So... what do you want to watch--
"xanadu" or "satan's doom"?

265
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,670
I'm reading.

266
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,420
- turn that thing down,damn it.
- Sorry.

267
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,690
Can I come in?

268
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,100
sure. I believe you know my roommate.

269
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,280
- Hi,hurley.
- Hey,kate.

270
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,840
got somethin' in yr eye,hugo?

271
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,320
Why don't we talk in the kitchen?

272
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,130
I know it's in a box,but,uh...

273
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,110
it's pretty damn good wine.

274
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,910
I tested it.

275
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,930
So how's the life at casa de claire?

276
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,150
Baby aaron keeping you up all night?

277
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,310
No. No,he's a good sleeper.

278
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
Good for you.

279
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,540
you are terrible at this,freckles.

280
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,460
Terrible at what?

281
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,630
You already said you
didn't stay behind for me.

282
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,140
So at least be woman enough to tell
me you wanna use me for somethin'.

283
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,360
I wanna use you for somethin'.

284
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,090
See? Wasn't that hard.

285
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,660
For what?

286
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,750
For ben.

287
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,590
I want you to help me bust him out.

288
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,010
Y wanna play se backgammon?

289
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,020
You're on.

290
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,120
do you think I know what I'm doing?

291
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,030
Do you...

292
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,390
regret following me out here,or are ya
worried about what we should do next?

293
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,170
All I know is I'd be a lot more
worried if I was stin' on that beach.

294
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,030
And the rest of thgroup--
what are they saying?

295
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,730
I think they're saying,"baa."

296
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,840
that's the nice thing about sheep.

297
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,910
They're predictable.

298
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,190
But I ain't so sure about kate.

299
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,430
What do yomean?

300
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,290
I need your word you ain't
gonna do nothin' to her.

301
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,550
- Why would I do anything to her?
- Just give me your word, John.

302
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,900
You know what? Forget it.

303
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,300
no,no. No. All right.

304
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,600
You have my word.

305
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,090
She came to me about an hour ago,

306
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,980
said she wanted my help busting
ben out of your basement.

307
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,860
Why?

308
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,180
She talked to that guy...

309
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,870
bruce lee from the freighter--
the guy you got locked up.

310
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,060
He told her toring ben
down to him for a chat.

311
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,820
No,that's impossible.

312
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,580
She doesn't even know where miles is.

313
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,800
What? The boathouse down by the dock?

314
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,310
If hugo knows,everybody knows.

315
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,830
are you sure about this?

316
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,150
Yeah,I'm sure.

317
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,040
Where you going with that?

318
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,060
Atever miles has to say
to ben,he can say to me.

319
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,410
son of a bitch.

320
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,330
come on.

321
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,660
you got one minute. Go.

322
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,180
How about some privacy?

323
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,320
55 seconds.

324
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,690
You know who I am?

325
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,120
Yes.

326
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,860
You know who I work for?

327
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,430
Yes.

328
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,340
Then you know he's put a lot of
time and energy into finding you.

329
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:29,830
So now i found you,and I can
tell him exactly where you are.

330
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,920
Or I can lie and tell
him you were already dead.

331
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,580
And I'd be willing to
do that for $3.2 million.

332
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,590
You've arranged this meeting
so you could blackmail me?

333
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,590
It's extortion,if you
wanna get technical.

334
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,440
3.2? Well,why not 3.3 or 3.4?

335
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,160
What makes you think I have
access to that kind of money?

336
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,800
Do not treat me like I'm one of them,

337
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,750
like I don't know who you
are and what you can do.

338
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,280
Your friend charlotte has
seen me. She knows I'm alive.

339
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,900
I'll take care of charlotte.

340
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,910
You just worry about
getting me the money.

341
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,330
You have two days.

342
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,600
My present situation is
a little bit restried.

343
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,470
Can that be amended?

344
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,180
Okay.

345
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,010
- One week,in cash.
- Time's up.

346
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,930
- Don't even think
about- - I said time's up!

347
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,770
Ooh,this is hot.

348
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,790
You got your meeting.
Now I want my answer.

349
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,950
We got your name when
you called the freighter.

350
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,630
Of course,we know about you and
everybody else on the 815 manifest.

351
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,160
Then prove it.

352
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,120
Your name is katherine anne austen.

353
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:52,350
You're wanted for murder,fraud,arson,a
whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember.

354
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,730
You're a fugitive,got caught in
austraa,and the feds are bringing you back.

355
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,550
So,yeah,we know.

356
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,040
If I were you,I'd stay
right here on the island.

357
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,710
Who knows? Maybe you
didn't survive the crash.

358
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,460
Come on.

359
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,870
go back to your house,kate.

360
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
John,this has nothing
to do with you--

361
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,460
go back to your house,kate!

362
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
You okay?

363
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,700
I couldn't sleep.

364
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,810
Yeah. The beds take a
little getting used to.

365
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,600
I didn't wake aaron,did I?

366
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,560
No,aaron was born on this island.

367
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,900
He can sleep through anything.

368
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,850
John?

369
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,340
What are you doing?

370
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,280
I'd like A... a moment alone with kate.

371
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,790
Would you excuse us,please,claire?

372
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,270
it's okay.

374
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,390
Kate,I just need to know
what they said to each other.

375
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,140
miles told ben th he would lie to
the people he works for on the boat,

376
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,780
tell them that ben was
dead,for $3.2 million.

377
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:42,770
Listen, John, I'm sorry.

378
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,340
I asked you
where he was--

379
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,300
you're not welcome here anymore.

380
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,590
I want you gone by morning.

381
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,350
I rked it out so you two can have a few minutes of privacy.

382
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,470
I don't need any privacy.

383
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,250
You need to talk to her,kate.

384
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,700
I'll boutside.

385
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,430
hello,katherine.

386
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,700
Was it true,what he said?

387
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,540
Dr. Shephard-- that you're a hero.

388
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,960
Why won't you talk to me?

389
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,520
Because,mom,the last time i tried to talk to you,

390
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,400
when you got sick,when I risked my life to see you,

391
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,480
you screamed for help and called the police.

392
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,840
Please.

393
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,940
I don't want to fight with you,katherine.

394
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,730
Why are you here?

395
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,900
Because...

396
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,090
I...

397
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,300
it all changed when I thought you were dead.

398
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,940
My doctors have given me six months to live for the last four years.

399
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,680
I don't know how long I'm going to last.

400
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,260
I came here to tell you that I...

401
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,320
I don't want to testify against you.

402
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,110
Then don'T.

403
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,620
I want to see my grandson.

404
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,750
You came here to make a deal?

405
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,180
I just wanna meet him.

406
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,320
I don't want you anywhere near him.

407
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,250
We're finished.

408
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,700
we're finished!

409
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,870
oh,hey,freckles.

410
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,700
you okay?

411
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,370
Look,I'm sorry I couldn't do nothin'.

412
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,610
I wanted him to think that you fooled me,too.

413
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,470
No sense in him not trusting both of us.

414
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,810
He wants me gone by tomorrow.

415
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:14,530
What,he... banished you?

416
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,320
Well,I un-banish you.

417
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,410
You castay right...here.

418
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,720
this is my house.

419
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,530
okay,me and montezuma's house.

420
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,070
you're gonna be all right.

421
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,580
I'll keep you safe.

422
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,600
Time.

423
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,650
Okay,tell me.

424
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,410
What do you remember?

425
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,150
Okay,uh,queen of diamonds.

426
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,370
Then we... six... of... clubs.

427
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,730
Sorry.

428
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:27,650
And we have the red 10 of...hearts,maybe?

429
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:36,170
It's two out of three.

430
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,980
It's not bad.

431
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,380
It's progress.

432
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,310
Three cards,charlte.

433
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,510
Is that progress?

434
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,810
hey.

435
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,690
Been calling your boat all day.

436
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,170
Why isn't anyone answering?

437
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
We're here. How should we know?

438
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,140
- If they're not answering,then they're probably- 
- now are you telling me there is only one line on that boat?

439
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,640
There is another number that we're only supposed to use in emergencies.

440
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,520
It's an emergency.

441
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,660
Put it on speaker.

442
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,060
yeah?

443
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,520
Regina,it's charlotte.

444
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,360
Why are you calling me on this number?

445
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,750
Minkowski wasn't answering.

446
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,590
The people on the island want to talk to their friends,make sure they're all right.

447
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,600
What... friends?

448
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:45,230
They left last night.

449
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,330
Frank took 'em up in the helicopter.

450
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,240
What do you mean,they took off?

451
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,220
I thought the helicopter was with you.

452
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,900
morning.

453
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,980
Listen,I don't know what you think you're doing,

454
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,340
- but you're wasting your time. 
- Open your mouth.

455
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,800
Open your mouth.

456
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,150
Wide.

457
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,900
don't talk. Bite down. Bite down.

458
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,170
I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day,

459
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,650
I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself.

460
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,660
My name is John Locke,and I'm responsible for the well-being of this island.

461
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,930
Eventually,miles,you're gonna tell me who you are

462
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,080
and you're gonna tell me about the people on the boat

463
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,400
and you're gonna tell me why you're so interested in ben.

464
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,600
In the meantime,however,you're gonna keep your mouth shut.

465
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,140
I learned something yesterday.

466
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,730
No useaving rules if there's no punishment for breaking 'em.

467
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,530
you'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger.

468
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,900
enjoy your breakfast.

469
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,300
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

470
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,430
Just--slow down. Slow.

471
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,710
Oh,come on.

472
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,130
It's not like we ain't never done it before.

473
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,420
Yeah,I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night.

474
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,780
I get it.

475
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,910
You were sad.

476
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,950
But, I mean, how can you resist after that whole, "I'll keep you safe" thing?

477
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,610
no. Sawyer... just...

478
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,510
what?

479
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,680
what? What'd I say?

480
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,110
Just... forget it.

481
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,280
Oh,right.

482
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,640
You still think you might be pregnant.

483
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,460
I'm not worried.

484
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,080
And I'm not pregnant.

485
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,610
Are you sure?

486
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,950
Yeah,I'm sure.

487
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,180
I mean...whoo!

488
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,370
Would it have been the worst thing in the world?

489
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,480
Yes! Yes,it would've been the worst thing in the world.

490
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,410
What would we have done with a baby?

491
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,250
I'm going back to the beach.

492
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,370
Beach?

493
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
What,you're leavin' because of this?

494
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,740
That's that?

495
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,730
You crawl up in my bed one second,the next,you're just-- 

496
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,040
good-bye.

497
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,930
Don't make this about me,kate.

498
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,980
You didn't want a baby any more than I did.

499
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,710
You're just lookin' for some excuse to split,and now you got one.

500
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,080
wel that's all right,freckles.

501
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,550
I ain't gonna hold it against ya.

502
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,590
I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed,

503
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,210
because in about a week,

504
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:15,280
you'll find some reason to get pissed at Jack and bounce right back to me.

505
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,300
miss dunbrook.

506
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,910
Are the people ready to proceed?

507
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,430
May we approach the bench,your honor?

508
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,310
Please.

509
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,340
Unfortunately,your honor,our chief witness,diane jansen,

510
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:08,120
the mother of the defendant,is unable to testify because of medical reasons.

511
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,420
How long will you need?

512
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,570
I can't say right now.

513
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,080
What I'll do is grant a recess for lunch,

514
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,430
but be prepared to proceed with your case after we return.

515
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,130
This court is now in recess.

516
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,220
all rise.

517
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,130
We have to talk.

518
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,780
my key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday,d now she's got cold feet.

519
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,970
Quit posturing,and let's get to it.

520
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,030
What are you offering?

521
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,340
Four years in.

522
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,890
No jail time.

523
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,440
Kate austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other peoples' lives after a plane crash

524
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,380
and nearly starved to death on a deserted island,

525
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,740
and after all that,you put this woman on trial for rescuing her mother from an abusive husband.

526
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:04,070
If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time,then...

527
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,440
you must have a hell of a closing,melissa.

528
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,790
All right.

529
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,570
Time served,plus 10 years' probation and agreement that she does not leave the state.

530
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,210
What does that matter?

531
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,250
- She can go anyw--  
- I'll take it.

532
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,110
No. Wait,kate-- 

533
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,340
give me something to sign, and I'll sign it,

534
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,900
and then I walk out the back door.

535
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,650
I just... 

536
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,620
I just want this to be over.

537
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,970
I can do that.

538
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,550
10 years' probation,and you stay put.

539
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,640
I have a child.

540
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm not going anywhere.

541
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,890
hey.

542
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,680
how did you know I'd be here?

543
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:14,090
Uh,your...your lawyer gave me the heads-up.

544
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:17,060
he owed me one.

545
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,570
Thank you... for saying what you did.

546
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,920
you're welcome.

547
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,520
You know, Jack, I've heard you say that story so many times,

548
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,660
I'm starting to think you believe it.

549
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,500
I just-- I just wanted to tell you th what I said in there...

550
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,980
didn't mean it.

551
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,480
You wanna follow me?

552
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:55,940
Come by for a visit?

553
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:02,020
I... I actually have to get over to the hospital,

554
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:08,790
but,um,maybe you and i could grab some coffee together or something?

555
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,570
I know why you don't wanna see the baby, Jack.

556
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,970
But until you do,until you want to...

557
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,080
there's no...you d me going for coffee.

558
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,820
But,um...

559
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,320
if at any time you change your mind,come and see us.

560
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,840
Yeah. Okay.

561
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,060
Bye.

562
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,630
Bye.

563
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,090
hello?

564
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,640
Kate!

565
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,170
I'm so glad you're back.

566
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,300
He missed you so much.

567
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,960
Did you keep him away from the tv?

568
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,210
Absolutely.

569
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,170
I just put him down for a nap.

570
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,460
hey,buddy.

571
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,060
hey.

572
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,340
hey.

573
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,280
Hi,mommy.

574
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:39,330
Hi,aaron.
