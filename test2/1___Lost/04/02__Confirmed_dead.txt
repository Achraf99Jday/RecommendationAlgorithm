1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,370
I'm sorry, george.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,930
Just tell my sister that I love her.

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,370
You killed naomi! she wants her people to come here.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,930
And trust me, when they do,

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,570
We had better be far away from here.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,770
If you want to live, you need to come with me.

7
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:22,770
no one's going anywhere with you, john.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,530
What are you doing? same thing I've always done, kate--

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,070
Survivin'.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,970
The thunder's getting louder.

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,300
Sorry, ron.

12
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,570
Drone's got nothing but seafood at 5,000 meters below.

13
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,770
You picking anything up with yours?

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,700
Zip. I'm trying to get her a peek over this ridge

15
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,700
As soon as I can.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,700
Sonar's pinging up something now.

17
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,700
Hey, you wanna switch feeds?

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:20,930
Roger that.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm headed on a bearing of about 1-3-7

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,170
From the coordinates we pulled off our guy's map.

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,630
But don't hold your breath.

22
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,130
Magnetometer is picking up

23
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,630
A hell of a lot of anomalies down here.

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,800
A chest full of doubloons?

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,470
Keep dreaming, ron.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,970
Let's swing around on the next bridge and recalibrate.

27
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,970
Uh... are you getting this?

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,470
What? what's up?

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,100
It's... it's an airplane.

30
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,100
Oh, my god.

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,130
It's oceanic 815.

32
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,300
This haunting footage comes to us

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,830
From the"christiane i,"

34
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,830
A salvage vehicle in the indian ocean.

35
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,700
For more than two months,

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,700
It's been scouring the depths of the sunda trench off bali

37
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,570
In search of the remains of sunken trading ships.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,570
Late last night,

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,130
Two remotely operated vehicles, or r.o.v.s.,

40
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,630
That verified what

41
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,670
The national transportation safety board

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,670
Had long feared, that the commercial aircraft...

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,670
How you want your eggs, dan?

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,330
Disappeared after departing sydney, australia,

45
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,000
On september 22nd, 2004...

46
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,500
So what happened? they found that missing plane?

47
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,000
This footage confirms that oceanic flight 815...

48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,700
Dan? did in fact crash at sea.

49
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,700
Dan? even with this tragic discovery...

50
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,700
Dan, why are you so upset? victims families say

51
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,200
That they're left without any sense of closure.

52
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,130
I don't know.

53
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,230
I can't find my vest! check under your seat!

54
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,370
I already did! get ready!

55
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,900
Here, just take mine!

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,970
Everybody out! now!

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,570
Hey, genius! go! no, no!

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Go!

59
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:23,730
No! aah!

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,430
Hey there.

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,970
Are you jack?

62
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,470
Yeah, I'm jack.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,170
Who are you?

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm daniel faraday.

65
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,230
I'm here to rescue you.

66
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,220
Dan
Hey, dan.

67
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,580
The chopper-- how many of you were on it?

68
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,380
Uh, four, including me.

69
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,450
So what happened to the rest of them?

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,980
Yeah, yeah, i, uh, have no idea.

71
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,980
I don't know how many of 'em were able to get out

72
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,980
Before it went down. I just-- I jumped, and I lost my, uh,

73
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,020
What do you call it? my--my pack.

74
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,980
My phone was in my pack.

75
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,450
If I had my phone, I would just, uh... we have a phone.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,620
You--you have a phone. uh...

77
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,350
Thank you. thanks.

78
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,180
Minkowski
Minkowski.

79
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,920
Hey, george. it's daniel. dan?

80
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,920
Yeah. the chopper com went dead. what the hell happened up there?

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,420
Yeah, I don't know.

82
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,420
George, there was-- there was an electrical storm.

83
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,120
All the instruments, they just-- I think they went down.

84
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,120
But listen, I made-- I made contact

85
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,820
With some of the survivors, and, uh, we were just, uh-- dan,

86
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,820
am I on speaker?

87
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,220
Would you give me just--just one second?

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,280
Don't worry. I don't know...

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,950
Naomi covered for us.

90
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,450
They don't know what locke did to her.

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,350
You sure about that?

92
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,650
Okay, okay.

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,680
So the boat hasn't heard from anybody else yet, but, uh,

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
These are g.p.s. transponders,

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
And my team and I are all wearing these.

96
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,750
The transponders will send the locations back to the ship,

97
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,480
And then the ship will send

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,320
All the locations back into the phones.

99
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,420
Uh... oh, there is my signal right there,

100
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,420
And hopefully, we'll get the signals

101
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,420
From the rest of the team soon.

102
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,820
Will you help me find 'em?

103
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,850
Absolutely. okay.

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Thank you.

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,850
Hey, where are the rest of your people?

106
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,350
Most of them are back at the beach.

107
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,350
Most of them?

108
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,320
Dude, what's wrong with you?

109
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,850
You're gonna get struck by lightning.

110
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,720
Storm's about to pass, hugo.

111
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,250
It's a freakin' monsoon. we gotta...

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,950
Let's go.

113
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,820
Why you going east?

114
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,320
I thought you said the barracks were due south.

115
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,320
Because, james, we have to make a little detour first.

116
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,980
Detour to what?

117
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,320
There's a cabin I have to go to.

118
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,920
But the cabin was back that way.

119
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,280
What did you say, hugo?

120
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,920
I, uh,

121
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,280
Thought your were talking about the airplane cabin.

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,980
Why are we wasting our time going to some shack anyway?

123
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,980
because we're supposed to.

124
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,580
Right, like you were supposed to throw a knife

125
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,350
Into that naomi chick's back?

126
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:20,120
You mind telling us who you're getting your orders from,

127
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,320
Colonel kurtz?

128
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,350
I got 'em from walt.

129
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,450
Anything?

130
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,520
No, but it's a big island.

131
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,520
The freighter could be approaching from the other side.

132
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,680
That's the spirit.

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,980
Juliet, you lived amongst the others.

134
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,480
Why would ben say

135
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,980
The people coming here intend to do us harm?

136
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,620
Because he's a liar and he's trying to scare us.

137
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,520
That's what ben does.

138
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,250
Or because the people coming here

139
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,380
Intend to do us harm.

140
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,550
How many guns do you have left?

141
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Hey. is that from your chopper?

142
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,220
Yeah, yeah. that, uh, yeah, they...

143
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,650
Reduced the weight load when we started going down.

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,250
Ha ha. I guess that's why they pushed me out.

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,620
What's this for?

146
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,020
I'm not in charge of, uh, packing, so...

147
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,180
Um... you're not, huh?

148
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,420
We should, uh... you wanna keep moving?

149
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,580
Hey, daniel, why did you bring the gun?

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,280
Yeah... as a precaution.

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,050
Precaution against what?

152
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Rescuing you and your people...

153
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,380
Can't really say its our primary objective.

154
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,580
Then what is?

155
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,720
It's miles.

156
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,450
It's miles. come on.

157
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,950
What the hell do you mean you saw walt?

158
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,450
In a dream?

159
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,650
No dream. it was walt. only...

160
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,180
Taller.

161
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,480
Taller? what, like a giant?

162
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,650
Okay, what exactly did walt tell you?

163
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,650
He said I had work to do,

164
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,820
That I had to stop this woman, naomi,

165
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,950
From bringing the rest of her people here. what,

166
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,950
you didn't ask any follow-up questions?

167
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,780
Ben had shot me and left me for dead. walt saved my life,

168
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,080
So I pretty much took him at his word.

169
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,080
He shot you, yet here you are,

170
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,420
Fit as a fiddle, trompin' through the jungle.

171
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,820
The bullet went in one side, came out the other.

172
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,850
I'd probably be dead if I still had a kidney there.

173
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,620
Anything else?

174
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,980
It's down there.

175
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,320
Miles!
Hey, miles!

176
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,650
Miles!
Miles!

177
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,920
Is he dead?

178
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,580
Back up, handsome.

179
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,050
Miles!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!Whoa, whoa! Miles!

180
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,550
Take it easy. it's okay. they're here to help us.

181
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,750
It's okay, miles. they're just trying to help.

182
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,280
Hey! back away from him! hands where I can see 'em!

183
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,450
Kate, it's all right. it's okay.

184
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,980
You're kate!

185
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,020
You wanna tell me where naomi is?!

186
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,020
What?

187
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,250
Naomi-- the woman you killed!

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
Where is she?

189
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,150
Ms. gardner?

190
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,750
I'm miles straume. we spoke on the phone earlier.

191
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,120
Oh. oh, please come in.

192
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,490
Which room is it?

193
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,790
It's upstairs at the end of the hall.

194
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,990
I get paid in advance. $200, cash only.

195
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,990
You told me $100 on the phone.

196
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:10,990
that was before my buddy at the police station

197
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,690
Told me your grandson was murdered.

198
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,790
It's gonna be $200.

199
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,790
Fine.

200
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,190
No matter what you hear,

201
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,450
Don't come up.

202
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,390
You're not doing your grandmother any good

203
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,890
Staying here, man.

204
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,950
You're causing her a lot of pain.

205
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,220
I...

206
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,220
I wanna go downstairs and tell her you've gone.

207
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,520
But the only way I'm gonna be able to do that

208
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,150
Is if you tell me where it is.

209
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,850
So where is it?

210
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,650
You can go now.

211
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,290
Did it work?

212
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah.

213
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,620
He's at peace now.

214
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,290
Here.

215
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,420
You get a refund, half off.

216
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,450
Wasn't as tricky as I thought.

217
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,750
Thank you.

218
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,520
Thank you.

219
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,290
Miles  Miles! 
Miles. Miles! Hey, hey!

220
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,020
What are you doing? what are you doing?

221
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,650
These are good people. they why'd naomi use the damn code?

222
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,450
Yeah, you remember when she said,

223
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,950
"tell my sister I love her"? well, she doesn't have a sister.

224
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,950
That's what we're supposed to say

225
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,550
If we get captured and have a gun to our heads.

226
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,290
Like right now jack here would say,

227
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,620
"tell my sister I love her." you get it?!

228
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,490
We didn't kill your friend. then take me to her body.

229
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,750
Miles, what about charlotte? what about frank? take me to naomi!

230
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,720
Listen, naomi was killed, but not by us.

231
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,420
It was--it was a man by the name of john locke.

232
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,520
He's not with us anymore. kate, seriously, if I have to ask you again--

233
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,850
Look, even if I took you to her body,

234
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,520
You wouldn't know what happened. I'll know!

235
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,350
Now take me to her body.

236
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,850
Alex
alex.

237
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,420
Alex
alex.

238
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,190
What? something I need to tell you.

239
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,090
Keep your mouth shut, mr. linus.

240
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,190
Karl. now if you're gonna sleep with my daughter,

241
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,720
I insist you call me ben.

242
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,920
Easy kid. guy's just trying to get in your head.

243
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,550
Go take a walk or somethin'.

244
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,220
Mind if I ask you a question, james?

245
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,590
Yeah, I do.

246
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,620
Why'd you leave kate behind?

247
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,120
You're wasting your time, yoda.

248
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,390
I know it's not pleasant, but let's face it.

249
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,550
You really don't stand a chance now.

250
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,950
Chance at what?

251
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,290
James, look at yourself.

252
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,790
Yes, on this island,

253
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,790
You're brave, daring, handsome.

254
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,120
You're someone.

255
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,690
But if you left with them...

256
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,550
Back in the real world, a lowlife scam artist like you

257
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,590
Could never compete with a first-class surgeon.

258
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
I think kate was really upset

259
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,150
When you made your choice to come with us.

260
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,120
Thank god she has jack there to comfort her--

261
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,190
James!
James!

262
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,120
Don't. don't what?!

263
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,990
Anyone want to tell me why we're keeping this guy alive?!

264
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:42,990
we're keeping him alive

265
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,850
Because he's been on this island a lot longer than any of us,

266
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,250
Because he has information we need,

267
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,090
And because apart from his mouth,

268
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,090
He's completely harmless.

269
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,590
His mouth put that hole in your gut?

270
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,820
Okay, james,

271
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,520
Let's--let's execute him right here, right now,

272
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,620
In front of his daughter.

273
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,890
It's only a matter of time before he gets us, johnny.

274
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,390
And I'll bet he's already figured out

275
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
How he's gonna do it.

276
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,350
So you walk him.

277
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,120
What is he doing?

278
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,550
The light...

279
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,550
Is strange out here, isn't it?

280
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,090
It's... it's kind of like it doesn't--

281
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,090
It doesn't scatter quite right.

282
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,650
Dan?
Dan?

283
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,120
Your name's dan, right?

284
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,190
Listen, dan,

285
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,950
I know that you don't want anybody to get hurt, right?

286
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,020
So why don't you just put that away?

288
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,050
But we're just trying to help--

289
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:39,050
Kate, you're wasting your breath.

290
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,950
Let's just let this play out and see what happens, okay?

291
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,290
They didn't kill her.

292
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
It happened like they said it did.

293
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,550
It's charlotte.

294
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,820
She's only 3 kilometers from here. all right, then. let's go get her.

295
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,420
I said let's go.

296
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,120
You need to put the guns down. what?!

297
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:07,150
Put the guns down. now why would I do that?

298
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,750
Because our friends are out in the jungle right now

299
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,750
Holding a gun at your head and his head.

300
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,750
So I'm gonna forget about the misunderstanding.

301
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,420
Just put the guns down. come on. how stupid do you think i--

302
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,790
I don't know, miles.

303
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,890
How stupid are you?

304
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,260
How many different languages do you have to read that in

305
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,260
Before you believe it's true?

306
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,130
How many different languages are there?

307
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Excusez-moi.

308
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,960
He wants to know if we're lost. remind him that people in our line of work

309
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,630
Are terrible at keeping secrets.

310
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,030
I know about the dig.

311
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,930
He says the site is closed.

312
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,130
Then tell him to open it.

313
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,230
Dinosaur?

314
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,660
Not by a few million years.

315
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,530
It's an ursus maritimus.

316
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,100
Wait, "ursus" as in bear?

317
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,130
As in polar bear.

318
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,630
Charlotte, we're in the desert. this is a hoax, right?

319
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,500
He wants to know what you're doing with the hammer. excavating.

320
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,700
Is that a collar?

321
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,160
Hi yourself.

322
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,660
We were worried when you didn't get back,

323
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,660
So we went out to the cockpit and tracked you from there.

324
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,860
Thanks for that, for what it's worth. don't mention it.

325
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,700
Somebody could've told me that the calvary were here.

326
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,630
I gave you that...

327
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,830
Wink.

328
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,400
What are your names?

329
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,900
Uh, I'm daniel faraday, and this is miles--

330
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,360
Don't tell him my last name.

331
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,860
I guess this is just miles.

332
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,860
What do you do for a living, daniel? I'm a physicist.

333
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,360
I mean, I guess you could call me a physicist.

334
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,360
I don't really like being pigeonholed into one-- dan, I swear to god,

335
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,630
You say one more word, I'm gonna break your fingers.

336
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,360
And what do you do, miles? I collect soil samples.

337
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
Well, that's nice. well, maybe you can help me.

338
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,730
You say you're not here on a rescue mission,

339
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,800
And the world at large believes us to be dead.

340
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,800
But here we are, alive and well,

341
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,630
And you don't seem remotely surprised to see us.

342
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,060
Oh, my god. you guys were on oceanic flight 815. wow!

343
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,300
Is that better?

344
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,260
I can't believe you're alive.

345
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,730
How many of you are there?

346
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,060
Why do you wanna know?

347
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,500
Why wouldn't I want to know?

348
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,760
48 of us survived the crash.

349
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
That's not counting the tail section.

350
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,960
They're pretty much all dead now-- hugo.

351
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,060
So you've all been living here this entire time?

352
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,460
Is that your baby?

353
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,430
Yeah. this is aaron.

354
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,360
Did you have him here on the island? mm-hmm.

355
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,700
That's amazing.

356
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,160
Well, I've got about a million more questions

357
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,300
I want to ask you,

358
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,230
But they can wait until we get you back to the freighter.

359
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,930
We've all got one of these transponders,

360
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,730
So if we just sit tight, they're gonna be here soon, okay?

361
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,400
This team of yours-- how many of you are there?

362
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,630
Four, including me.

363
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,200
And what happened to your helicopter?

364
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,230
I don't know. the pilot was trying to put it down.

365
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,760
Where?

366
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,100
I don't know. I had to jump.

367
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,400
It was chaos.

368
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,260
I'm lucky to be alive.

369
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,260
Get up. you're coming with us.

370
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,130
What? what?

371
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,730
We need to stay where we are so that they can find us.

372
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,900
See, there's your problem. we don't want to be found.

373
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,960
I wouldn't mess around with that if I were you.

374
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It can't hurt to try and call someone else. oh, it can hurt.

375
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,930
What'd you do? I didn't do anything.

376
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,660
Your friend--charlotte.

377
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,600
She's moving.

378
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,430
And she's moving fast.

379
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,630
She's running from something.

380
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,000
According to this, she's right here.

381
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,730
Charlotte?!
Charlotte?!

382
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,400
Charlotte!
Charlotte!

383
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,030
Over there. over there.

384
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,000
Vincent
Vincent.

385
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,260
Locke's got her.

386
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,460
We want to caution our viewers that the images

387
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,960
They are about to see are graphic in nature.

388
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,460
Viewer discretion is advised.

389
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,460
Authorities have released dramatic footage

390
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,130
Of the sunken remains

391
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,330
Of oceanic flight 815.

392
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,430
The national transportation safety board

393
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,100
Has set up a hotline

394
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,060
For family members of the oceanic victims.

395
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,000
The n.t.s.b. has begun

396
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,200
The victim identification process.

397
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,860
We have confirmation

398
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,900
That this is the pilot-- captain seth norris.

399
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,660
In a statement, the n.t.s.b. said that,

400
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,660
"due to the sheer depth of the..."

401
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,260
"...recovery of the bodies would be next to impossible.

402
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,930
"we can only hope

403
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,600
"that identification will provide closure

404
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:58,030
To the families of the victims."

405
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,960
National transportation safety board, oceanic hotline.

406
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,060
Yeah, let me speak to your supervisor.

407
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,060
Yes, sir. are you a family member of the deceased?

408
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,060
No, I'm not, but I got some information on the crash.

409
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,060
May I please speak to your supervisor?

410
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,060
Sir, if you could just tell me-- look,

411
00:31:21,524 --> 00:31:23,060
i'm staring at the television right now.

412
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,060
You're broadcasting footage of the wreckage

413
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,060
And saying that that's the pilot, seth norris.

414
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,400
Yes, sir?

415
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Well, that's not him.

416
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,200
Please hold.

417
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,530
Who am I speaking with?

418
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
Doesn't matter who I am. you're showing footage

419
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Of seth norris, and that's not him.

420
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,130
Listen, this guy married his high school sweetheart at 19.

421
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,800
He always wore his wedding ring. and I'm telling you,

422
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,300
There's no ring on that body. sir, it's likely the ring fell off when--

423
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm telling ya, that is not him.

424
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,800
And how exactly is it

425
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,200
That you know all about captain norris?

426
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,560
Because I was supposed to be flying oceanic 815 on that day.

427
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,600
That's them.

428
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,830
That's somebody from my team.

429
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,160
What's wrong with you people? we're here because of you.

430
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,330
I just almost died jumping out of a helicopter

431
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,860
Because you called us for help.

432
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,930
Maybe we should go see who launched that flair.

433
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,060
Yeah, I mean, they could be hurt, john. she's lying.

434
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,830
And whatever they came for, it isn't us.

435
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,160
We keep moving forward as planned. sure.

436
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,560
Who are we to argue with taller ghost walt? you know what?

437
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,300
You people do whatever you want. I want you to come with us.

438
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,460
I'm not asking for permission. and if you think

439
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,160
You're gonna bloody stop me from getting to my--

440
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,000
What did you do, you son of a bitch?! uhh!

441
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,800
Vest.

442
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,860
What?

443
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,660
Vest. vest.

444
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,500
Is he alive?

445
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,060
He's got a pulse.

446
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,260
Frank? Frank
Frank? Frank.

447
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,160
Hey, hey. frank.

448
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,500
Are you okay?

449
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,830
What happened?

450
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,430
We got struck by lightning.

451
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,900
Frank, where's charlotte?

452
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,000
She bailed out just b-before we went down.

453
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,000
I don't know where she is. where's the chopper?

454
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,400
I saw a cow.

455
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,830
Lapidus, where's the chopper? where did it crash?

456
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,830
Crash? the hell kind of pilot you think I am?

457
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,400
I put her down safe and sound right over there.

458
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,600
So this is the team?

459
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,600
You've familiarized yourself with their profiles? unfortunately, yes.

460
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,830
With respect,

461
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,430
These are the wrong people for a mission like this.

462
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
None of them have field experience,

463
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,800
Military training.

464
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,960
You can't just drop them in unprotected.

465
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,960
It'll be a disaster. they're not unprotected. they have you.

466
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,030
There's only so much I can do.

467
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,830
Your modesty

468
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,730
This is a high-risk covert op in unstable territory.

469
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,100
It's dodgy enough without having to babysit

470
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,030
A head case, ghostbuster, anthropologist and a drunk.

471
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,200
To be fair, he's also a pretty good pilot.

472
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,530
It's madness. what if we find survivors from 815?

473
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,400
There were no survivors.

474
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,300
Yes, I know. but what if there are survivors?

475
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,900
There were nosurvivors of oceanic 815.

476
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,030
Don't ask questions. just do what you were hired for.

477
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,700
Every member of this team

478
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,700
Was selected for a specific purpose.

479
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,200
Everything relies on you

480
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,200
Getting them in, getting them out

481
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,360
And preventing anyone from getting killed.

482
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,000
Think you can do that?

483
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
Sure.

484
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,900
Why not?

485
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,900
There's some minor damage,

486
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,600
But the mechanical systems are intact.

487
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,100
So it'll fly, then?

488
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,460
Absolutely.

489
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,060
Can I have the phone now?

490
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,060
Tell you what. I'll give you the phone

491
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,060
If you tell me what you people are doing here.

492
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,060
I'll tell you what we're doing here

493
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
If you give me the phone.

494
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,560
Don't say anything about your sister.

495
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,330
Hello?

496
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,300
Regina, it's miles. I need to talk to minkowski.

497
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,660
Minkowski can't come to the phone right now.

498
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,660
It's important. go get him.

499
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,300
Miles, he can't come to the phone right now.

500
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,800
All right, have him call me when he can.

501
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,460
I gotta go.

502
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa! what are you doing with her?

503
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,200
We're taking her with us.

504
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,730
What's the point? that's--that's not naomi. it's just meat.

505
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,830
Miles, we can't just leave her here.

506
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,260
Miles is right. we burned up most of the damn fuel

507
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,260
Flying around in that storm.

508
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,430
We barely got enough to get back to the freighter.

509
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,330
We're not gonna carry any unnecessary weight.

510
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,730
I'll take her on the next run. I promise, dan.

511
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,660
There's a blanket over there by my backpack.

512
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,660
Would you grab it? yeah.

513
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,900
Look as bad as it feels?

514
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,100
How bad does it feel?

515
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,230
What's your name again?

516
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,300
Juliet
Juliet.
Juliet.

517
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,630
Juliet
Juliet.

518
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,960
Juliet what?

519
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,630
Juliet burke
Juliet burke.

520
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Juliet burke...
Juliet burke...

521
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,230
You weren't on that plane, were ya?

522
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,130
Miles£¡
Miles!

523
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,600
Yeah?

524
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,430
This is juliet,

525
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,300
And she was not on the plane.

526
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,800
What?! you sure?

527
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,860
You know how many times I studied that damn manifest?

528
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,760
Believe me, there's no "juliet burke" on that plane.

529
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,860
She's a native.

530
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,160
Really?

531
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,460
Where is he?! back off!

532
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,960
Where's who? you wanted to know why we're here?

533
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'll tell you why we're here.

534
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,700
We're here for benjamin linus.

535
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,360
Now where is he?

536
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,460
James, listen to me.

537
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,330
Please-- keep your mouth shut.

538
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,700
You okay? I feel like I've got a cinder block on my chest,

539
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,700
But I'll survive. I'm sorry you got shot.

540
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,900
I didn't intend for that to happen. really?

541
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,260
Cause it seemed like you were about to shoot me yourself.

542
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,030
What good would you be to me dead?

543
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,660
Well, I feel much more comfortable now. thanks.

544
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,260
I guess this is the part

545
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,260
Where I'm supposed to say, "i told ya so."

546
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,100
James, I stand corrected.

547
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,330
You want me to do it?

548
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,700
No, it's my mess.

549
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,360
I'll clean it up.

550
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,260
No, wait!

551
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,360
Danielle, you should escort alex away from here.

552
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,530
Alex, come on, let's go. come on. alex. no! no!

553
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,370
She's right. let's go.

554
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,360
anyone who doesn't want to see this should leave now.

555
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,100
Please. john, we should talk about this!

556
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,880
Claire, what if one of those bullets had hit you or the baby? john,

557
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,330
listen.

558
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,530
I have information that you need.

559
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,230
I have answers.

560
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,360
What is the monster?

561
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,930
What?

562
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,860
The black smoke, the monster.

563
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,530
What is it?

564
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,760
I don't know.

565
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,260
Good-bye, benjamin.

Your instinct was right, john.

579
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,300
These people are a threat, and if you shoot me,

580
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,500
You'll never know how great a threat they were,

581
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,360
Because I know what they're doing here.

I know what they want.
