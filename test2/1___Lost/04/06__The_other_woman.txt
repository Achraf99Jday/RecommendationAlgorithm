1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,210
previously on "lost"...

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:02,860
who are you?

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,900
Daniel faraday.

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,830
I'm here to rescue you.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,440
I just almost died jumping out of a
helicopter because you called us for help.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,160
She's lying,and whatever
they came for,it isn't us.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,930
Is that from your chopper?

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,590
Yeah,yeah,that,uh,yeah,they...
reduced the weight load.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,880
What's this for?

10
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,620
Uh,rescuing you
and your people--

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,120
can't really say it's
our primary objective.

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,820
Then what is?

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,590
hello.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,610
You must be Dr. Burke.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,550
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,310
I'm Harper Stanhope.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,160
Please sit.

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,570
Today is just a meet and greet so
that we can get to know each other.

20
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,790
Please don't take this the wrong way,but
I-I really don't think I need therapy.

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,860
How about we call it
"talking" instead of therapy?

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,350
- Okay.
- Good.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,470
let's talk.

24
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,900
So you've been here a week.

25
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,500
And what's your least
favorite part so far?

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,190
I don't like being
treated like a celebrity.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,460
And is that surprising?

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,670
You're big news right now.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,910
Yes,I know.

30
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,250
I guess I don't like being
the center of attention.

31
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,460
It makes me feel isolated...

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,940
alone.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,640
well,maybe you feel
that all eyes are on you,

34
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,330
but you're not a celebrity,

35
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,340
and soon enough,you'll realize that
you're no different than anyone here.

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,830
Oh,I-I know.

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,560
I-I never meant that I...

38
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,100
yes?

39
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,090
Harper,I'm sorry for the interruption.

40
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,550
I know you don't like me busting
in,but ben would like to see th doc.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,670
she's all yours,tom.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,670
Was nice talking to you,juliet.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,000
Welcome to the island.

44
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,910
that harper's a piece of work.

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,850
but you give her a week,she'll
have you cryin' about your daddy.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,610
I'm speaking from
personal experience here.

47
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,400
welcome to your humble abode.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,510
This is for me?

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
The whole house?

50
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,530
You're here to help us with some
very important research,juliet.

51
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,320
We pulled out all the stops.

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,900
Two bedrooms,two baths. Washer,dryer.

53
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,010
Fresh linens,a well-stocked fridge.

54
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,620
oh,and I know you love the opera.

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,440
You have all the classics on cd.

56
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,960
Ben,this is amazing.

57
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,100
Seriously,you shouldn't
have gone to all the trouble.

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,800
I'm only gonna be here for six months.

59
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,940
Right,of course. But...

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,930
we want you to feel at home.

61
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,270
need some help?

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,740
I'm fine.

63
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,230
I just can't seem to get it steady.

64
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,510
okay.

65
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,550
nice.

66
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
Thanks.

67
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,170
Why are you going to all this trouble
when we're about to leave this island?

68
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,200
Well,I still need somewhere
to sleep tonight,right?

69
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,550
Juet.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,960
have you seen lochartte and faraday?

71
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,910
All their stuff's gone.

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,870
No,I haven't seen 'em.

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,530
You still have the sat phone,right?

74
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,980
he saw them going into the jungle.

75
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,800
Why didn't he say anything?

76
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,470
you said...

77
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,870
they are friends.

78
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,360
aren't they?

79
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,160
All right,we've got a lot of
ground to cover,so let's fan out.

80
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,330
If you cut their trail,call out to me.

81
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,220
I'll come to you.

82
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,000
jack?

83
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,240
hello,juliet.

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,840
Long time no see.

Lost
Season04 Episode06

88
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,070
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,820
I came to deliver a message...

90
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,660
from ben.

91
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,320
The two people you're looking
for-- faraday and lewis...

92
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,570
they're headed to the tempest.

93
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,180
And if they figure out
how to deploy that gas...

94
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,600
then everyone on this
island is going to die.

95
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,720
Why don't you stop them?

96
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,520
Because ben wants you to do it.

97
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,880
Hocan ben possibly know where
they are when he's a prisoner?

98
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,360
Ben is exactly where he wants to be.

99
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,990
How am i supposed to stop them?

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
By pointing the gun
and pulling the trigger.

101
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,910
who are you?

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,410
I'm an old friend of juliet'S.

103
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,550
I just told her where the people
you're looking for are headed.

104
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,870
Maybe you and your gun can go,too.

105
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,590
you okay?

106
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,920
Uh,I was just looking for some gauze.

107
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,100
I-I didn't know anyone was here.

108
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,780
How'd you manage that?

109
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,970
I,um...

110
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,550
I-I work over at the power station.

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,040
I was pressed up
against the transformer.

112
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,580
Take aeat.

113
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,870
Let me take a look at it.

114
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,290
You're burke,right?

115
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,810
The baby docto

116
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,330
what gave me away?

117
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,060
I heard we lost henrietta this morning.

118
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,610
It's okay. It's not your fault.

119
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,760
Pregnant women are dying on this island.

120
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,780
I was brought here to help fix that.

121
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,030
So whose fault is it?

122
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,060
Believe me,nobody expects
you to fix it overnigh

123
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,670
you have aone to talk to?

124
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,700
Any friends here?

125
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,860
Maybe harper.

126
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,650
Harper hatesE.

127
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,180
we only talk because we have to.

128
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,010
I get the feeling that she is a mean...

129
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,280
and spiteful person.

130
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,760
She's my wife.

131
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,300
She's your wife?

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,730
- I'm sorry.I didn't-- -
no,don't worry about it.

133
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,270
Really,it's okay. It...

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,170
okay,you're,uh...

135
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,150
you're set.

136
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,010
Much obliged,ma'am.

137
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,230
I know this place can wear on
you,but if you need to talk...

138
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,480
I'm around.

139
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,370
Good to know.

140
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,360
if you promise not to tell
your wife what I said about her,

141
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,050
I won't tell anyone that you
lied about how you hurt your arm.

142
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,480
I know a chemical burn when I see one.

143
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,780
you got a deal.

144
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,800
Uh,by the way...

145
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,900
I'm goodwin.

146
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,770
Juliet.

147
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,750
faraday and charlotte are
heading for the tempest.

148
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,330
The tempest?

149
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,890
It's safer for you if
I don't talk about it.

150
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,690
No. Talk about it,please.

151
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,440
It's an electrical station
that powers the island.

152
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,600
Why would they go there?

153
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,440
If there's something you need to
tell me,now's the time to do it.

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,790
What I need is for you to help me.

155
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,470
Will you help me?

156
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,570
If we move all night,maybe
we can still catch them.

157
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,200
Thank you.

158
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,840
I think it's that way.

159
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,550
But whatappens if I...

160
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,760
what if I can't do it?

161
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,500
Dan.

162
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,260
Lo at me.

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,770
I know you can do this.

164
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,730
Should we get going?

165
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,690
Yeah.

166
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,100
It's-- it's okay.
It's okay.It's kate.

167
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,860
so they have miles?

168
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,190
Yeah,but he's fine. They're...

169
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,390
they're treating him fine.

170
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,060
I thought you two were
with jack at the beach.

171
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,540
What are you guys doing out here?

172
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,440
Jack was trying to communicate with
sayid and desmond on the freighter,

173
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,610
but their sat phone ran out of juice.

174
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,770
It's totally dead.

175
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,610
There's no way we can call the boat.

176
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,380
So we vonteered to get the spare batteries out
of the packs that we threw out of thehopper.

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,320
So... if you threw your pack
from the chopper,what's that?

178
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,110
This? it'S...

179
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,990
just borrowed this.

180
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,090
Mind if I take a look?

181
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,240
Go ahead,dan. Show her.

182
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,560
Batteries,huh?

183
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,380
What's
this--

184
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,160
What?

185
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,130
That woman--
what was her name?

186
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,590
Harper.

187
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,080
The two of you friends?

188
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,520
Not exactly.

189
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,350
She was my therapist.

190
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,930
You people had therapists?

191
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,340
It's very stressful being an other,jack.

192
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,010
Seemed kinda hostile,even
for a therapist.

193
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,670
I'm sure there are things from your
past that you'd rather not talk about.

194
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,390
Yeah.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,680
You read them all in my file.

196
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,680
Trust me,jack.

197
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,110
You don't wanna see my file.

198
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,780
The problem occurs somewhere
during the second trimester,

199
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,010
when the mother's immune
system is triggered.

200
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,420
The white blood cell count plummets.

201
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,970
It's like the...

202
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,220
immune system turns on the fetus.

203
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,110
- May I?
- Sure.

204
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,920
Any thought yet on a cause?

205
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,700
Mm,it's really too early to tell,but only women
who've conceived on the island does it happen to...

206
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,080
- which makes me
wonder- - hey,juliet.

207
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,110
Oh,ben,I didn't know you were here.

208
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,130
Ethan's out sick.

209
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,970
I have an extra egg salad on rye.

210
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,010
I was just checking to
see if juliet wants it.

211
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,750
Thanks. No,I already ate.

212
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,950
Oh,besides,I have an appointment
with your wife in ten minutes.

213
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,530
Great.

214
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,570
Tell her I said hi.

215
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,010
Oh,will do.

216
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,780
Ben?

217
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,720
No,I'm fine.

218
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,960
so,juliet,what do you think of ben?

219
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,750
He's great.

220
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,900
Uh,very smart...

221
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,720
and intense.

222
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,880
Challenging.

223
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,900
He's been really good to me.

224
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,020
Of course he has.

225
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,540
You look just like her.

226
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm sorry?

227
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,330
And I see you and my
husband have become friendly.

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah.

229
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,260
He's great.

230
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,380
He's been really helpful.

231
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,150
When did you start sleeping with him?

232
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,100
What?

233
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,120
Look,juliet,I'm not an idiot.

234
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,990
So just tell me.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
When did it start?

236
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,700
Okay.

237
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,800
I'm not doing this. We're done.

238
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,050
No. Please respect me enough to spare me
the pretense that you are actually offended.

239
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,260
I know.

240
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,690
I followed you.

241
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,140
Watched you.

242
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,970
I'm sorry.

243
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,760
It doesn't matter anymore.

244
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,750
But what does matter is that you
listen to me and that you believe me.

245
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,960
And if you continue to have
a relationship with goodwin,

246
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,030
there will be consequences.

247
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,660
I don't want him to get hurt.

248
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,720
I would never hurt him.

249
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,280
Look it,I am not talking about you.

250
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,360
I am talking about ben.

251
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,390
Hi,john.

252
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,210
Hey,claire.

253
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Is there something I can do for you?

254
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,010
I wanna know what's going on with miles.

255
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,570
Right now not a whole lot. I'M...

256
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,680
bringing him food and water
until he decides to talk.

257
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,960
I'd like to talk to him melf.

258
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,000
and why would you want to do that?

259
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,550
John,we have to find out who these
people are and where they came from

260
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,410
and why they're not
interested in rescuing us.

261
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,300
And you don't think I'm
gonna get that out of him?

262
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,540
No,I...

263
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,010
I just think we might be
taking the wrong approach.

264
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I mean,you killed one,ben shot
one,and now we're holding one prisoner.

265
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,650
You know,it's not hard to understand
why they might think we're hostile.

266
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,890
I might be just a
little less intimidating.

267
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,420
It's not gonna happen,claire.

268
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,960
John,I
don't--

269
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,690
you do remember what charlie
said about these people.

270
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,420
All charlie said was
whose boat it isn'T.

271
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,110
Don't you wanna know whose boat it is?

272
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,360
rabbit today?

273
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,610
Running out of chickens.

274
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,150
This didn't have a number on it,did it?

275
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,830
What?

276
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,140
Eat,change,put your laundry
and dishes by the door.

277
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,700
I'll be back to collect
them in 15 minutes.

278
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,380
So has the revolution begun yet? Or...

279
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,680
what are you talking about?

280
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,150
Well,you're the leader now.

281
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,010
I know it's a tough position.

282
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,070
You have to deal with all those people
constantly second-guessing your decisions,

283
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,530
and it always starts out
so innocently,doesn't it?

284
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,730
A question here,a comment there,and
then if you're not careful,

285
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,550
you find you have a full-blown
insurrection on your hands.

286
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,450
Believe me,your people
are gonna be so angry

287
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,240
when they realize you
still don't have a plan.

288
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,950
And I assume you have a plan.

289
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,990
I always have a plan.

290
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,290
Does it involve you raising 3.2 million?

291
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,380
That's a lot of money.

292
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,760
Wait.

293
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,490
Maybe this'll get you started.

294
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,040
Put your laundry and dishes by the door.

295
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,920
I can help you,john.

296
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,680
We have sharednterests...

297
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,670
or at least a common enemy.

298
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,460
And that would be our
friends on the freighter.

299
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,660
Not them.

300
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,130
The one they work for.

301
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,600
Let me out of here.

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,250
Give me some semblance of freedom,let
me sleep in bed and eat with utensils,

303
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,240
and I give you my word I'll tell
you everything you wanna know

304
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,920
- about the person who sent the freighter.
- Yeah,but see,there's the problem.

305
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,450
I don't trust your word.

306
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,940
All right,then.

307
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,670
I guess I'll have to show you.

308
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,980
I hope this is good.

309
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,130
I don't know much about wine.

310
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,380
I swiped this off the sub.

311
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,000
- there.
- Thanks.

312
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,810
I wish we could do this all the time.

313
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,840
I hate that we have to be so... private.

314
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,700
What's the matter with being private?

315
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,630
's ridiculous.

316
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,990
I've been sleeping on
the couch for a year.

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,070
Why am I not just telling her?

318
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,900
I don't think it's a good idea.

319
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,710
Why not?

320
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,480
Ben wouldn't like it.

321
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,850
That's what th is about?
You're worried about ben?

322
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:31,160
Why? Because he has a crush on you?

323
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,110
You know?

324
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,370
Come on. Everyone knows.

325
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,920
He follows you around like a puppy.

326
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,910
And you don't think that's a problem?

327
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,540
now a little less than
ailometer from here,

328
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,060
he has me working with chemicals

329
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,900
that could kill every man,woman and child
on this island if I flip the wrong switch.

330
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,900
Trust me,ben has enough on his plate.

331
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,070
The last thing he cares
about is you and me.

332
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,090
I just.

333
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,460
Get the feeling that he uld be upset.

334
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,360
What's ben gonna do?

335
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,140
goodwin!

336
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,890
You see where the tail landed?

337
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,400
Yeah,probably in the water.

338
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,130
You run,you can make
that shore in an hour.

339
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,930
Ethan,get up there to that fuselage.

340
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,520
There may actually be survivors,

341
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,340
and you're one of 'em--a
passenger.You're in shock.

342
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,300
Come up with an adequate story if
they ask.Stay quiet if they don'T.

343
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,640
Listen,learn,don't get involved.

344
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,220
I want lists in three days.Go.

345
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,270
Something's wrong.We should've...

346
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,800
we should've caught up with 'em by now.

347
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,780
These people base jumped
out of a helicopter,jack.

348
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,960
Let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.

349
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,330
Hey,it's okay.

350
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,650
It's okay.

351
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,320
it's all right.

352
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,930
It's okay.

353
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,050
Take it easy.

354
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,910
take it easy.

355
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,380
I'll go get her some water.

356
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,350
Yeah.Thanks.

357
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,470
what happened?

358
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,590
I was going back to the beach,and...

359
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,820
I ran into faraday and that woman...

360
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
charlotte.

361
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,990
I think she hit me.

362
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,280
They disapared out of camp last night.

363
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,480
We've been trying to catch up with them.

364
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
Do you know where they were headed?

365
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,960
Some sort of...

366
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,360
power station.

367
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,410
Jack.

368
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,710
They had gas masks.

369
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,720
Juliet?

370
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,260
Juliet!

371
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,960
Juliet!

372
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,670
Juliet!

373
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,450
all right,no tricks.

374
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,650
You're not leading me out into
the jungle so you can disappear

375
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,840
or shoot me in the back.

376
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,610
No tricks,john.

377
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,260
We don't even have to
leave the living room.

378
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,930
So let's have it.

379
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,210
We have a deal,right?

380
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,480
How do I know you're not gonna run off
and meet your people first chance you get?

381
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,800
if my people still wanted me,john,they
would've stormed this camp long ago.

382
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,220
It's behind that picture.

383
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,510
36,15,28.

384
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,480
"red sox"?

385
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,110
I taped over the game.

386
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:29,600
this is charles widmore.

387
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,460
This is the man whose
boat is parked offshore.

388
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,670
This is the man that's been
trying to find the island.

389
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,340
Who's the man in the blindfold?

390
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,160
One of my people that had
the misfortune to get caught.

391
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,750
How does widmore know about the island?

392
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,150
I don't know,but he does.

393
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,920
What does he want?

394
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,530
John,three months ago
in gainesville,florida,

395
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,670
the virgin mary seemed to appear in a patch
of mold on the side of an old housing complex.

396
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:11,220
When the word got out,over 5,000 people
came to see her face for themselves.

397
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,520
You've survived an airline
crash on this island.

398
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,830
One minute,you're in a wheelchair.

399
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,590
The next minute,you're
doing jumping jacks.

400
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,190
If 5,000 people came out
to see a piece of mold,

401
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,500
how many people do you think
would come here to see you?

402
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,700
Charles widmore wants
to exploit this island,

403
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,360
and he'll do everything
in his power to possess it.

404
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,870
everything I know about
charles widmore is in this file.

405
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,030
Some of it's vague,some of it's
guesswork,some of it's concrete.

406
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,920
But this is everything,and
now it's all yours.

407
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,740
I'm sorry I di't tell you all th sooner.

408
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,270
But it was the only
bargaining chip I had left.

409
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,350
There's one more thing I need to know.

410
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,330
Your man on the boat...

411
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,220
I want you to tell me who it is.

412
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,320
All right.

413
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,010
But you might want to sit down.

414
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,250
She came through here.

415
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,710
So did they,about half
an hour ahead of her.

416
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,760
What happened?

417
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,820
Sorry?

418
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,840
At locke's--
why did you stay?

419
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,940
I stayed because I had
to find something out.

420
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,250
Are you gonna tell me,or are we gonna keep
walking through the jungle like it doesn't matter?

421
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,430
I stayed to find out if the
peoplon the freighter know who I am,

422
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,230
if they knew that I'm a fugitive,

423
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,130
that I'm wanted for murder.

424
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,370
Do they?

425
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,130
Yeah,they know.

426
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,930
We should keep moving.

427
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,110
God knows where juliet is.

428
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,570
Come on in.

429
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,580
Sorry.I have to get this ham
out of the oven,or it'll dry out.

430
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,880
Please.Don't mind me.

431
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,670
How are you feeling,by the way?

432
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,800
Never better.

433
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,630
It smells delicious.

434
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,240
Ben,I thought this was a dinner party.

435
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,990
Just you and me.

436
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,970
Oh,I guess I should've
made that clearer.

437
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,160
No.

438
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,270
It's fine.I-I hope
you like dinner rolls.

439
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,710
I indeed.

440
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,850
I wanna thank you fohow wonderful
you've been with zach and emma.

441
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,190
They're really sweet kids.

442
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,870
ben,they've been asking me about
their mother in los angeles.

443
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,360
I'm not really sure what to say.

444
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,010
They'll stop asking in time.

445
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,790
They're children.

446
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,040
Do they really belong here?

447
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,960
They're on the list,juliet.

448
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,330
Who are we to question who's
on the list and who's not?

449
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,280
Now that we have everyone on the list
from the tail section,what a goodwin?

450
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,210
he's been undercover for three weeks.

451
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,160
he's making a case for
this woman--ana lucia.

452
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,480
he thinks she'd be a valuable
member of our society.

453
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,120
But betwn you and me,I don't see it.

454
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,470
He feels very passionately about her,

455
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,920
almost inappropriately so.

456
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,610
After losing ethan,it's a risk.

457
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,220
Goodwin stays where
he's at right now,juliet.

458
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,930
There's no reason for
him to hurry back,right?

459
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,170
But his assignment will be over soon.

460
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,700
I promise you.

461
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,540

juliet.

470
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,950

You wanna release the gas?You'll
die with the rest of us.

478
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,860
No,no,no.I-I'm not
trying to release them.

479
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm trying to--I'm
trying to render it inert.

480
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,740
Juliet,I just wanna make it safe.

before he can use it against us!

488
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,210
Juliet...

489
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,310
look me in the eye and
tell me you are certain that

490
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:25,510
benjamin linus wouldn't use this
gas to kill everyone on this island!

491
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,900
We know he's used it before.

492
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,880
If you wanna stop us,you're
gonna have to shoot us both.

493
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,760
10 seconds to contamination.

494
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,400
- Daniel!
- Yeah,yeah!I'm trying.

495
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,650
Come on.

496
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,230
- come on
- 5...

497
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,410
4...

498
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,860
3...

499
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,110
2...

500
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,900
master caution reset 
No current alarms 
system pressure within norm param 
tank integrity tests report secure

501
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,630
that...

502
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,300
that was a close one.

503
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,190
what are you reading?

504
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,010
Shephard's file.

505
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,230
Mikhail dropped it off.

506
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,080
He's a spinal surgeon,ben.

507
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,170
He has extensive
experience in tumor removal.

508
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,480
How about that?

509
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,790
He can help you.

510
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,060
I thought you'd be more excited.

511
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,810
What's wrong?

512
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,350
I need you to come with me.

513
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,500
After our last raid on the tail
section survivors,they ran off,

514
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,600
left the beach.

515
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,690
I sent pickett and tom to track their
location,and they came across this.

516
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm sorry,juliet.

517
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,050
Sorry about what?

518
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,190
oh,my god.

519
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,910
oh,my god!

520
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,910
Oh,my god!

521
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,890
Oh,my god.

522
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,450
goodwin.

523
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,590
wh happened?

524
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,660
We don't know.There
weren't any witnesses.

525
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,810
I can only assume they found
out he wasn't one of them.

526
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,610
Guess I should've listened to you.

527
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,260
Why are you showing me this?

528
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,170
Why did you bring me out here?

529
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,530
What,you mean instead of his wife?

530
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,890
You knew this would happen.

531
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,560
You sent him out here because
you knew this would happen.

532
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,980
you wanted this!

533
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,000
You wanted him to die!

534
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,070
Why?

535
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,460
"Why"?

536
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,720
You're asking me why?

537
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,800
After everything I did to get you here,

538
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,970
afteeverything I've
done to keep you here,

539
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,920
how can you possibly not understand...

540
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,700
that you're mine?

541
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,790
Take as much time as you need.

542
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,920
whoa,kate,it's all right.

543
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,000
They're on our side.

544
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,170
Our side,juliet?

545
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,040
She just knocked me unconscious.

546
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:46,030
Yeah.I'm very sorry about
that,but I had no choice.

547
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,920
Look,daniel's inside
securing the facility.

548
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,500
If you come with me,I will
be more than happy to explain

549
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,430
exactly how we just saved your life.

550
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,230
All right.Let go.

551
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,290
I'll take their word for it.

552
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,230
You okay?

553
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,280
He wanted me to kill them.

554
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,550
Ben.

555
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,240
He told me to kill both of them.

556
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,200
How can he tell you anythi?

557
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,690
I don't know,but he knew w to get to me,

558
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,310
and he knew where they were
going and what they were doing.

559
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,850
Don't you understand?

560
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,650
These people came here
to wage war against ben,

561
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,350
and ben's gonna win,jack.

562
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,490
And when he does,you don't
want to be anywhere near me.

563
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,530
Why not?

564
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,050
Becae he thinks that I'mis.

565
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,410
And he knows how I feel about you.

566
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,510
He knows where to find me.

567
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,820
Beat that.

568
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,420
son of a bitch!

569
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,720
How'd you get so damn
good at horseshoes?

570
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,710
I don't know.

571
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,050
Guess I'm just...lucky.

572
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,030
What the hell are you doing out?

573
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,990
See you guys at dinner.
