1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,793
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,599
- We're taking the boy.
- I'm not giving you anybody.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,272
Dad.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,588
Walt.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,320
- Where is she?
- You mean Kate?

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,072
I love her.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,392
Kate.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,276
Look here and here.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,035
You can see it's eroding
into the spinal artery in the L5 area.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,156
Plus all this extradural growth.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,550
I'm surprised it hasn't caused
permanent ischemia.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,910
He says
you don't need to talk in whispers.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,912
He knows
he doesn't have a chance.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,958
- Your father appreciates candour?
- We both do.

15
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
Then tell him I'm very sorry,

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,112
but he's not a candidate for surgery.

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,638
The way the tumour is situated on the
spine, it's not possible to remove it.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,117
He wants to know why you won't try.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,239
Because what your father is looking for
is not a surgical procedure.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,471
What he is looking for is a miracle.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,314
He said, "I did not come
all this way for you, sir."

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,436
"I came for him."

23
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,953
Ms Busoni...

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,473
You fixed a woman
with a crushed spinal column.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,358
An impossible surgery.
And now she walks, yes?

26
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,750
I consulted many medical journals
before making this trip.

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,072
Then you know it was a very different
case under different circumstances.

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,515
But a miracle, right?

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,909
Everything that my father's saying,
the risks, the unlikelihood,

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,991
he's absolutely right.

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,310
But will you try?

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,277
I'll have to admit him
in the next couple of weeks,

33
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,555
run some tests.

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,271
Locke?

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,711
John.

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,755
Stay in there.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,274
- Michael.
- Stay in there, Jack.

38
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,435
- Whatever's going on...
- I'm going after my son.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,795
And nobody is going to stop me.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,440
That is my right.
That is a father's right.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,398
There's another way...
You going to shoot me?

44
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,111
You don't understand, man.
You don't have any idea.

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,716
- Now get in there.
- We can do this together.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,078
- I'll come with you.
- No. I have to do it. Now.

47
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,720
And I have to do it alone.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,109
- What happened?
- Michael knocked you out.

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,917
- Look over here.
- Why would he...?

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,560
He went after Walt.

51
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,835
You feeling nauseated, sick?

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,350
- No. I'm OK.
- Good.

53
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,351
Give me a boost up.

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,075
It's no use.
I bolted it shut from the inside.

55
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,071
You what?

56
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,032
No point changing the combination
if you can get in through the air vent.

57
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,793
That's really good thinking.

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,548
Wanna tell me
why you let Michael in here?

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,714
He wanted a gun. For shooting practice.

60
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,831
Shooting practice.

61
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,591
The button.

62
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,753
- How long was I out?
- About 20 minutes.

63
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,553
We're on shift for the next four hours.
Nobody's coming down here.

64
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,474
Better hope Sawyer shows up
to get his Band-Aid changed.

65
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,630
Morning.

66
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,030
- You just throw a banana at me?
- Couldn't find any rocks.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,508
There are nicer ways
to wake a man up, Freckles.

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,190
It's time to get your bandages changed.

69
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,398
- Why can't you do it for me?
- Because I'm not your nurse.

70
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,789
And Jack's got the bandages.

71
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,757
Of course he does.

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,111
Wanna give me a hand?

73
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,591
Thanks.

74
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,389
Come on.

75
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,556
- This place still creeps me out.
- You'll get used to it.

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,671
Where is everybody?

77
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,154
Jack? John?

78
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,629
- Maybe they went out for ice cream.
- In here.

79
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,229
Jack?

80
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,437
In here. In the armoury.
Michael locked us in here.

81
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,715
- What'd he say?
- I got it.

82
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,036
Hope you got the combo, Doc.

83
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,873
Right three times to 25.

84
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,832
- 25, got it.
- Left two times to 29.

85
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,678
Right once to 40.

86
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,399
- Howdy, boys.
- What are you doing?

87
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,835
We're going after him.

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,268
What happened?

89
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,590
Michael went after Walt.

90
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,072
Went after Walt?

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,675
Held a gun on me, put us both in there,
and went after Walt.

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,070
- What're you doing?
- What does it look like?

93
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,232
- I'm coming with you.
- You're still on antibiotics.

94
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,676
It's a good thing
I'm travelling with my doctor, then.

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,795
How is he?

96
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,714
- I thought you'd gone home.
- My home is a hotel room.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,911
I like it more here.

98
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,270
I think you need to find a better hotel.

99
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,911
You didn't answer my question.

100
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,229
His counts aren't
where I'd like them to be.

101
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,830
You've been doing tests for a month now.

102
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,273
I'm thorough.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,877
I have a confession to make.

104
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,232
I don't believe in miracles.

105
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,238
Guess I'm not too sure
about them, either.

106
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,951
I bet your wife feels differently.

107
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,272
Your wife, she is the woman
you fixed, isn't she?

108
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,432
Yes.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,036
I'm thorough, too.

110
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,119
She must be very special to let you work
until 4:30 in the morning.

111
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,795
Completely lost track...

112
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,395
- I gotta... Will you excuse me?
- Of course. Go.

113
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,911
And, Jack, thank you.

114
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,036
Of course.

115
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,678
Good night.

116
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,151
Hey.

117
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,111
How is he?

118
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,192
Hey. Sorry to wake you.

119
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,755
I gotta get up anyway.

120
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,069
So, how is he?

121
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,671
About the same.

122
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,638
Sarah, I'm sorry. I meant to...

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,631
It just got...

124
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,434
That's the price
of being a miracle worker.

125
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,916
- Where you going?
- I gotta go to the gym.

126
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,355
Then I got some papers to grade.

127
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,070
I didn't wanna say anything
until I knew either way, but...

128
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,630
I was late, so I got a pregnancy test.

129
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,392
Don't worry. It was negative.

130
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,956
Do you wanna talk about it?

131
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,394
What's to talk about?

132
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,149
Sarah, I...

133
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,837
See you later, Jack.

134
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,156
Well?

135
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,392
I can't say it's definitely Michael's,
but it looks like his boot print.

136
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,436
There's one over here, too.

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,909
That sounds like a trail.

138
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,912
- You got a gun for me?
- You're not coming.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,069
Excuse me?

140
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,469
Someone has to take care of the button.

141
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,630
So, why should that person be me?

142
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,280
You're not coming. You're staying.

143
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,871
All right?

144
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,317
Let's go.

145
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,272
- What'd she do to you?
- What?

146
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,432
Kate. What'd she do?

147
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,796
- She didn't do anything.
- Right.

148
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,873
Yelling at her because she wanted
to help get Mike makes a lot of sense.

149
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,918
Why don't you go back
and see if I hurt her feelings?

150
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,231
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, I know.

151
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,153
- You love her.
- What'd you say?

152
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,637
What?

153
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,311
Any of this look familiar
from when you were coming back?

154
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,029
Yeah. There's my favourite leaf.
How could I forget this place?

155
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,155
What's wrong?

156
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,030
When you came across the island,
what side was the ocean on?

157
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,713
You came from the east.
Michael's heading north.

158
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,030
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

159
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,033
He's not going back
to where you came from.

160
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,588
He's heading somewhere else.

161
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,353
- Hello, Hurley.
- Hey.

162
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,351
Cool hat, dude.

163
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,637
- Is Kate all right?
- Yeah.

164
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
I guess Michael took off.

165
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,470
What do you mean?

166
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199
He stole some guns
and he went all commando.

167
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,759
Said he was going after Walt.

168
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,073
Later, dudes. Gotta get to the hatch.

169
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,268
Doc, you wanna slow down?

170
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,390
Take a break a minute?

171
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,391
Good idea.

172
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,550
He still heading north?

173
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,594
Yep.

174
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,956
- You think he's lost?
- Doesn't seem to be.

175
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,156
Trail's as straight as the interstate.

176
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,595
The path of a man
who knows where he's going.

177
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,593
Where are you going, Jack?

178
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,789
What?

179
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,710
Let's say we catch up with him.

180
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,395
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna bring him back.

181
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,110
- What if he doesn't wanna come back?
- I'll talk him into coming back.

182
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,714
This is the second time
he's gone after Walt.

183
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,190
He knocked me out.
He locked us both up.

184
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,353
Something tells me
he might be past listening to reason.

185
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,318
You think we should just let him go?
Write him off?

186
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,838
Who are we to tell anyone
what they can or can't do?

187
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,151
It's not too late to go back.

188
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,832
The tumour's aggressive,

189
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,957
but your father could lead
a normal life for another year.

190
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,031
Go back where?

191
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,875
Home?

192
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,958
- Have you changed your mind?
- No.

193
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,955
Is that it?

194
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,994
Even if you don't succeed,
you're giving us a chance.

195
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,394
That's all we wanted.

196
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,635
I'll come out and check on you
before I scrub in.

197
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,474
OK.

198
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,473
Am I interrupting?

199
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,869
No, I was just leaving.

200
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,069
I'll see you in the morning.

201
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,673
I'll see you in the morning.

202
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,629
ITR reports need to be signed
by you as chief resident.

203
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,749
What?

204
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,149
Careful.

205
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,152
There's a line, Son.
You know it's there.

206
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,869
Pretending it's not would be a mistake.

207
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,359
Guess you would know.

208
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,470
It may be OK for some people,
but not for you.

209
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,076
You sure Mike went this way?

210
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,310
- Why do you ask?
- I don't know, Mr Clean.

211
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,597
I probably would have gone
around Mount Vesuvius.

212
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,550
Why'd you pick that name?

213
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,393
Ain't it obvious?

214
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,155
All you need's an earring and a mop.

215
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,596
No. Your name. Why'd you pick Sawyer?

216
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,669
Pick?

217
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,471
After the census,
Hurley gave me the flight manifest.

218
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,791
Your name is James, right? James Ford.

219
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,872
What's it to you?

220
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,153
Just an interesting name to choose.

221
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,117
Who'd you get it from?

222
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,839
Who says I got it from anybody?

223
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,992
- Michael.
- Jack, get down.

224
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,479
- Michael!
- Jack!

225
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,359
Michael!

226
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,713
- Michael?
- Jack!

227
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,474
What?

228
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,395
- He's close.
- He was shooting at someone.

229
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,517
- You want them coming back?
- Personally, hell, yeah.

230
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,750
You said these people
were two days away.

231
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,229
They took Cindy
less than a mile from our camp.

232
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,231
Over here.

233
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,232
- Shell casings. How many?
- Three. Michael's.

234
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,517
You boys deaf?
I heard at least seven shots.

235
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,353
You heard them, Daniel Boone.
What's your count?

236
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,034
Seven sounds about right.

237
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,510
It's getting dark.
Which way did Mike go?

238
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,034
What?

239
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,078
You out here for Michael,

240
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,436
or just payback for getting shot?

241
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,556
Why are you out here, Doc?

242
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,196
You got your reasons, and I got mine.

243
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,269
Jack.

244
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,749
Jack!

245
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,956
- I had it.
- I know, Son.

246
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,359
I got it all. I had it.

247
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,558
He was a sick old man on a table
for seven and a half hours.

248
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,637
His heart gave out. It's nobody's fault.

249
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,030
I've got to go tell her.

250
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,475
I've already done that.

251
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,157
Lest you forget,
I am still chief of surgery.

252
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,431
Where is she?

253
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,159
- Maybe you should go home.
- Where is she?

254
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,111
She's gone.

255
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,509
Jack.

256
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,557
Go home.

257
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,149
Jack.

258
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,551
Gabriela.

259
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,274
My father told me that you'd gone. I...

260
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,229
I...

261
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,676
Thank you for trying.

262
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,673
I'm so sorry.

263
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,273
I'm so sorry.

264
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,636
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

265
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,751
- Wait...
- It's OK.

266
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,871
I can't.

267
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,311
What do you mean, you lost it?

268
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,392
He's a man, not a boar.
His sign's more subtle.

269
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,553
- I need light to follow him.
- Here. Light.

270
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,991
- We'd better head back.
- What?

271
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,911
- Find the trail.
- I've lost it.

272
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,231
You don't just lose a trail.
You just don't want to find him.

273
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,913
I've been running through the jungle
toward the sound of gunfire

274
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,991
because I don't care about Michael.

275
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,795
- Don't turn around on me.
- You won't get him to come back.

276
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,237
If we just turn around and go back,
we're never gonna see him again.

277
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,030
And that's gonna be on us.
On you and on me.

278
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,793
You're exactly right.

279
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,594
But if I were you,
I'd listen to Mr Locke.

280
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,390
Who are you?

281
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,438
He's the son of a bitch
that shot me on the raft.

282
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,355
Why don't you point the gun down?

283
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,155
Probably be best if we just keep
our hands at our sides, gentlemen.

284
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,277
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry about Michael.

285
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,157
He's not gonna find us.

286
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,231
- What do you want?
- Why don't you build us a fire?

287
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,635
I think it's time we all had a talk.

288
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,794
Geronimo Jackson?

289
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,429
As an expert in all things musical,
I never heard of these guys.

290
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,875
Shocking as that may be.
Geronimo Jackson?

291
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,599
This looks sweet. Let's give her a rip.

292
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,274
So, what do you think is the story
with that Libby chick?

293
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,397
- The story?
- She's kind of cute, right?

294
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,639
In a "I've been terrorized by the Others
for 40 days" kind of way.

295
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,515
There is that.

296
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,958
I think I have a chance with her.

297
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,315
It's the classic desert-island scenario.

298
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,516
If I ever had a shot, this is it.

299
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,592
You think Claire's missed me yet?

300
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,318
Dude, it's been a day.

301
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,910
- This music is quite depressing.
- We can change it, dude.

302
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,195
You ever hear of Geronimo Jackson?

303
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,589
I'm afraid not. Where is Jack and Locke?

304
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,511
They went after Michael.

305
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,748
- Michael?
- He's run after Walt again.

306
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,798
- Everyone's gone to bring him back.
- Who's everyone?

307
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,237
Everyone. Jack, Sawyer, Locke.
And Kate.

308
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,754
Just sit down, Jack.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

309
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,308
I come in peace.

310
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,356
How do you know our names?

311
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,271
You took Walt.

312
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,435
Walt's fine. He's a very special boy.

313
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,910
You said you wanted to talk. Talk.

314
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,719
How long you been here on the island?

315
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,515
Fifty days.

316
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,752
Fifty days?
That's almost two whole months.

317
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,108
Tell me, you go over a man's house
for the first time,

318
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,589
do you take off your shoes,

319
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,036
put your feet up on his coffee table,

320
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,590
walk in the kitchen,
eat food that doesn't belong to you,

321
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,309
open the door to rooms
you got no business opening?

322
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,231
Somebody a whole lot smarter
than anybody here once said,

323
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,959
"Since the dawn of our species,

324
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,352
man has been blessed with curiosity."

325
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,352
You know the other one
about curiosity, don't you?

326
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,158
This is not your island.

327
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,435
This is our island.

328
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,954
The only reason you're living on it

329
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,429
is because we let you live on it.

330
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,390
I don't believe you.

331
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,748
- You don't believe what?
- I think you got one guy with a gun.

332
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,957
I think there's more of us
than there are of you.

333
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,349
I think if you had any real strength,

334
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,317
you wouldn't have had to send a spy.

335
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,270
Ethan.

336
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,072
That's an interesting theory.

337
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,390
Light them up.

338
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,752
We got a misunderstanding.
Your people, my people.

339
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,436
So, listen carefully.
Right here, there's a line.

340
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,317
You cross that line,

341
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,279
we go from misunderstanding
to something else.

342
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,515
Give me your weapons,
turn around, and go home.

343
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,069
No.

344
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,079
- Jack, maybe...
- No!

345
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,999
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

346
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,753
Bring her out, Alex.

347
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,755
She was following you.

348
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,400
Like I said, curiosity.

349
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,591
Don't.

350
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,397
The decision
you gotta make right now is this.

351
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,600
Can you live with the fact that I shot
this woman right in front of you,

352
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,956
and you could've saved her life
by giving up and going home?

353
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,034
Or are you gonna give me your guns,
turn around, and walk away?

354
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,752
It's your call.

355
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,559
- If you touched a hair on her head...
- Shut up.

356
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,435
I'm going to count to three.

357
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,870
One.

358
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,475
Two.

359
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,396
Stop.

360
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,792
Now them.

361
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,638
Give me the other one, too.

362
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,314
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

363
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,114
Jack...

364
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,914
You all right?

365
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,629
Yeah.

366
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,640
I was just trying to help, Jack.

367
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,518
When you told me not to go, I just...

368
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,590
I made a mistake.

369
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,873
Could you just talk to me for a second?

370
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,671
I'm sorry.

371
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,875
I'm sorry, too.

372
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,312
- Hey.
- Hey. How did it go?

373
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,112
He died.

374
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,475
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

375
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,589
- Who was over?
- My mom.

376
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,836
- The bridge game OK?
- Oh yeah. She's on a streak.

377
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,757
- Did you eat?
- Yeah. No.

378
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,671
It's late. I'm fine.

379
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,679
- You don't have to do that.
- It's therapeutic.

380
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,035
Cheaper than a shrink.

381
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,635
How did the daughter take it?

382
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,995
What's her name, Gabriela?

383
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,672
She kissed me.

384
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,436
She kissed me and I kissed her back.

385
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,479
I don't know how it happened.

386
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,758
I made a mistake, and this is my fault.

387
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,831
It's my fault that you and me...

388
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,631
I haven't been here, Sarah.

389
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,276
We don't even talk anymore.

390
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,588
I hate what's happening to us.

391
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,558
I promise you that things
are gonna be different.

392
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,111
I'm gonna work less.
I'm gonna be here for you.

393
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,512
I'm gonna fix this. We're gonna go
back to the way things were.

394
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,793
Jack?

395
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,835
I'm leaving you.

396
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,596
What?

397
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,639
I was already leaving you.
My mother was helping me pack.

398
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,475
I've been seeing someone.

399
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,278
Someone else.

400
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,558
I have to... I can't stay.

401
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,512
You will always need something to fix.

402
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,191
Goodbye.

403
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,711
See you, James.

404
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,914
Don't beat yourself up, Freckles.

405
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,833
If he'd told me to stay,
I'd have done the same thing.

406
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,155
What's the matter
with the little squirt?

407
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,954
Who's that?

408
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,235
You don't like old Uncle Johnny?

409
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,318
What is he doing to your toe?

410
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,230
Go away. I barely have enough food
to feed myself.

411
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,197
Here.

412
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,312
I see you found a new friend.

413
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,593
Progress.

414
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,238
I hear you were out looking for Michael.

415
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,629
Yeah.

416
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,109
He ran off looking for his kid again?

417
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,718
Not much you can do about that, then.

418
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,270
Is it true that you killed one of them?

419
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,359
One of who?

420
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,158
Them.

421
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,830
Sayid tells me that you're a cop.

422
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,634
I was a cop.

423
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,154
Can I ask you something?

424
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,514
Shoot.

425
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,479
How long would it take to train an army?
