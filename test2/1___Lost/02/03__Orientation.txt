1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,032
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,396
- Damn it!
- You all right, brother?

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,357
I'm fine. I'm fine.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,715
- I'm training.
- You're training for what?

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,950
For a race around the world.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,316
- Jack.
- I'm Desmond.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,510
See you in another life, yeah?

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,517
Type in exactly what I tell you,
understand? Nothing else.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,070
4... 8...

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,311
15...

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,435
16...

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,513
23...

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,239
42.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,753
Now press "Execute."

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,400
- What's gonna happen?
- Just push it!

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,831
Kate! Locke!

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,555
Who the hell is that?

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,191
Move and I kill him.

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,759
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,918
Others! Others! Others!

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,948
- What?
- Others.

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,071
Where's my boy?

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,876
Where's my boy?

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,553
Hey!

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,030
Hey, what did you do with my boy?
You hear me?

26
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,599
Come back here!

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,874
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,429
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke? Is this your destiny?

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,830
"All roads lead here".

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,195
My mother stole again from me this week.

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,796
I don't even keep money in my purse
anymore, I've been hiding it.

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,549
But when she wants a drink...

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,231
She stole 30 dollars.

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,032
I know it may not seem like
a lot of money to some of you,

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,317
but it's a lot to me.
And I want it back.

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,550
Something you want to say?

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,470
John, you've been coming here
for a month now...

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,870
I just don't think 30 dollars
is worth getting angry about.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,712
Francine feels 30 dollars...

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,314
Francine feels a little too much,
if you ask me.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,391
You all do.

44
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,637
Couple years ago,
my birth mother found me.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,790
And...

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,871
she told me...

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,831
I was special.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,790
And through her I met my real father.
Great news, right?

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,109
Well, he pretended to love me,
just long enough to steal my kidney,

50
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,111
because he had to have a transplant.

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,590
And then he dropped me back
in the world like a piece of trash,

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,319
just like he did
on the day that I was born.

53
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,874
You want your damn 30 dollars back?
I want my kidney back!

54
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,469
Probably a good idea.

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,757
You know if you get kidney cancer,
you've only got one.

56
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,671
That's funny.

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,676
I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting.

58
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,594
Oh, hell. You just said everything
I've always wanted to say in there.

59
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,559
Most of the time, I want to stand up
and scream "Get over it, freaks!"

60
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,791
- Well, why don't you?
- Ah, I have to keep a cork in.

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,111
Once I get all hot and bothered,
there's no stopping me.

62
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,633
Guess you won't be coming back
next week, huh?

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,711
No, not likely.

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,519
That's too bad. I like bald guys.

65
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,909
- I'm not bald.
- I can wait.

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm Helen, by the way.

67
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,555
Hi, Helen. I'm John.

68
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,393
Where's Kate?

69
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,153
Lower your gun
or I'll blow his damned head off.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,310
Where's Kate?

71
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,429
- Put it down.
- I'm not putting down anything!

72
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,476
Jack, calm down. It's OK.

73
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,073
- Do not move!
- Don't...

74
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,639
- What?
- He's unarmed...

75
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,870
He just had a gun pointed at your head!

76
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,471
What did you do?

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,115
What did you do?

78
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,871
We're all gonna die.

79
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,311
We're all gonna die.

80
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,719
- I have to fix it.
- What the hell's he talking about?

81
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,519
Listen! If you do not let me up,
we are going to die.

82
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,275
- Stop moving, or, I swear to God...
- Look at the wall! You see that?

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,190
That's a timer and it's counting down.

84
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,634
I've got to enter the code,
got to push the button.

85
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,438
- Or what?
- Jack, let him up.

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,909
Don't tell me what to do. Or what?

87
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,869
What's going to happen?

88
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,030
Do I know you?

89
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,152
You got him?

90
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,678
Bastard!

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,630
- What?
- Nothing, Jack.

92
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,359
Hey.

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,310
What are you doing?

94
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,675
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I...

95
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,072
I... just have trouble
sleeping in a strange bed.

96
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,628
It has nothing to do with you, Helen.
I promise. I really like you.

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,275
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

98
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,273
Morning.

99
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,794
Morning.

100
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,077
John, I know you like to drive
through my neighbourhood.

101
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,950
And I know that every now and then,
you like to park outside my house.

102
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,634
Now, I thought it might all stop when
I moved, but here you are.

103
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,678
Now, I'll admit,
at first I thought it was funny.

104
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,630
Now it's just annoying.

105
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,553
So how about you tell me
what the hell it is you want.

106
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,556
- Why?
- Excuse me?

107
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Why?

108
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,671
There is no "why".

109
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,032
You think you're the first person
that ever got conned?

110
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,873
You needed a father figure
and I needed a kidney.

111
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,838
And that's what happened.

112
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,911
Get over it.

113
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,474
And, John, don't come back.

114
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,190
You're not wanted.

115
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,750
I don't think you need that, Kate.

116
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,514
Whatever you're looking for,
maybe I can help.

117
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,636
Can you fix a computer?

118
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,038
- Then you can't help me.
- Sayid can fix a computer.

119
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,278
- Get him. Go and get Sayid.
- Can you get back up that rope?

120
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,555
There's got to be a front door here.

121
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,394
Down the corridor to the left.
Be persistent, the wheel sticks.

122
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,759
Got ya!

123
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,594
- Now, tell me what's going on.
- We don't have time...

124
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,478
- We're taking a time-out.
- Please, just let me...

125
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,949
You wanna get to work?
Tell me how you got here.

126
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,396
It was three years ago.
I was on a solo race around the world,

127
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,199
and my boat crashed into the reef
and Kelvin came.

128
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,874
- Kelvin?
- He comes runnin' out the jungle,

129
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,916
"Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!"

130
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,751
He brings me down here.

131
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,635
First thing he does,
cos it's beeping,

132
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,439
he types in the code,
pushes the button and it stops.

133
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,795
"What was all that about?" I say.

134
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,794
"Just saving the world", he says.

135
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,038
- "Saving the world?"
- His words, not mine.

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,230
So I started pushing the button too.

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,476
And we saved the world together
for a while, and that was lovely.

138
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,711
Then Kelvin died.
And now here I am all alone.

139
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,348
The end!

140
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,194
Don't tell me you believe this.
This is crazy.

141
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,919
You think that makes sense?
Pushing a button?

142
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,393
- You're going to take his word for it?
- His word is all we have, Jack.

143
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,597
You don't have to take my word for it.
Watch the film.

144
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,513
- What?
- The bookcase. Top shelf.

145
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,036
Behind <i>Turn of The Screw.</i>
Projector's in the pantry.

146
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,192
Here...

147
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,634
Dude, I gotta say, I didn't think
we were gonna get through the night.

148
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,592
And I wasn't even here
for that baby-stealing part.

149
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,310
I can assure you it was very exciting.

150
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,868
Things are finally returning
to normalness.

151
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,916
Sayid!

152
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,989
Aw, crap.

153
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,909
Sayid! We need your help.

154
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,154
What do you know?
What'd they do to you?

155
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,596
Who the hell are they?
Who the hell are they?

156
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,958
Others!

157
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,313
- Did you see Walt?
- The Others? How many?

158
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,948
How many?

159
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,237
- They had him blindfolded. Blindfolded.
- Yes!

160
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,914
Could be a hundred of them out there!

161
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,352
- Push me up.
- What?

162
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,512
Push me up.
I wanna try and get us outta here.

163
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,591
C'mon, help us out, Chewie.

164
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,239
They got it weighted down with
something. It's tied off somewhere.

165
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,032
Come on, lift me higher.

166
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,831
It's a girl.

167
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,229
Wanna tell me what was going on
down here before I showed up, John?

168
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,117
Kate was tied up. Desmond had a gun on
me. I think you caught the gist of it.

169
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,233
Desmond.

170
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,030
He wanted to know a lot about us.

171
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,350
How we got here. If we were sick.

172
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,830
- You didn't ask anything about him?
- He was the one with the gun.

173
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,198
You seem calm for someone who believes
the world's going to end in 45 minutes.

174
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,111
He'll fix it.

175
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,277
You understand that what he's saying,
it's insane. It's impossible.

176
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,237
Why is it insane?

177
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,397
The last time I saw the computer
that would save the world,

178
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,833
it didn't look like that.

179
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,276
Is the reason you're so upset
because he said he recognised you?

180
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,554
Because that would be impossible.

181
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,757
<i>Welcome. I'm Dr Marvin Candle,</i>
<i>and this is the orientation film</i>

182
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,638
<i>for Station Three</i>
<i>of the Dharma Initiative.</i>

183
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,951
<i>In a moment, you'll be given</i>
<i>a simple set of instructions</i>

184
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,396
<i>for how you and your partner</i>
<i>will fulfil the responsibilities</i>

185
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,870
<i>associated with this station.</i>
<i>But first, a little history.</i>

186
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,871
<i>The Dharma Initiative</i>
<i>was created in 1970</i>

187
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,997
<i>and is the brainchild</i>
<i>of Gerald and Karen DeGroot,</i>

188
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,072
<i>two doctoral candidates</i>
<i>at the University of Michigan.</i>

189
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,948
<i>Following in the footsteps</i>
<i>of visionaries such as BF Skinner...</i>

190
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,669
<i>... imagined a large-scale</i>
<i>communal research compound</i>

191
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,038
<i>where scientists and free-thinkers from</i>
<i>around the globe could pursue research</i>

192
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,792
<i>in meteorology, psychology,</i>
<i>parapsychology, zoology,</i>

193
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,156
<i>electromagnetism,</i>
<i>and utopian social...</i>

194
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,392
<i>... reclusive Danish industrialist</i>
<i>and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso,</i>

195
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,790
<i>whose financial backing made their dream</i>

196
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,078
<i>of a multi-purpose social science</i>
<i>research facility a reality.</i>

197
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,238
<i>You and your partner are currently</i>
<i>located in Station Three, or "The Swan",</i>

198
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,788
<i>and will be for the next 540 days.</i>

199
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,551
<i>Station Three was originally constructed</i>
<i>as a laboratory</i>

200
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,915
<i>where scientists</i>
<i>could work to understand</i>

201
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,434
<i>the unique electromagnetic fluctuations</i>

202
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,750
<i>emanating from this sector</i>
<i>of the island.</i>

203
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,118
<i>Not long after the experiments began,</i>
<i>however, there was... an incident.</i>

204
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,636
<i>Since that time, the following</i>
<i>protocol has been observed.</i>

205
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,228
<i>Every 108 minutes,</i>
<i>the button must be pushed.</i>

206
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,315
<i>From the moment the alarm sounds,</i>

207
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,235
<i>you will have four minutes to enter the</i>
<i>code into the microcomputer processor...</i>

208
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,356
<i>... induction into the programme.</i>

209
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,275
<i>When the alarm sounds, either you</i>
<i>or your partner must input the code.</i>

210
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,079
<i>It is highly recommended that you and</i>
<i>your partner take alternating shifts.</i>

211
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,078
<i>In this manner,</i>
<i>you will both stay as fresh and alert...</i>

212
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,833
<i>... utmost importance</i>
<i>that when the alarm sounds,</i>

213
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,549
<i>the code be entered correctly</i>
<i>and in a timely fashion.</i>

214
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,235
<i>Do not attempt to use</i>
<i>the computer for anything...</i>

215
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,512
<i>Congratulations!</i>

216
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,276
<i>Until your replacements arrive, the</i>
<i>future of the project is in your hands.</i>

217
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,477
<i>On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,</i>

218
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,835
<i>and all of us at the Dharma Initiative,</i>

219
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,835
<i>thank you,</i> namaste,
<i>and good luck.</i>

220
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,590
We're gonna need to watch that again.

221
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,112
What's that?

222
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,716
It's a present. It's been six months.
Sort of an anniversary, right?

223
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,714
- I didn't get you anything.
- That's OK.

224
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,995
Only cost me a buck.

225
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,236
It's to my place.
Thought you might be tired of knocking.

226
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,197
Well, Helen, I...

227
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,154
I don't know what to say.

228
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,112
There's just one condition though, John.

229
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,630
When you stay over, you stay over.

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,589
What do you mean?

231
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,952
I followed you last night.

232
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,234
To that house that you go to.

233
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,037
Is it your father's house?

234
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,832
Why would you follow me, Helen?
Why would you do that?

235
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,870
You sneak off
in the middle of the night.

236
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,235
I just needed to know
where you were going.

237
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,639
I care about you, John...

238
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,234
But what I do is my business.
It's personal.

239
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,756
I wasted 20 years of my life
being angry.

240
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,396
I told myself I would get over it,
but I... I couldn't do it alone.

241
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,511
I needed to find help.

242
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,191
You help me, John.

243
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,835
And I can help you.

244
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,519
You just have to promise me that you're
not gonna go to that place anymore.

245
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,433
All right.

246
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,718
All right?

247
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,628
You're going to watch that again?

248
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,508
- Aren't you?
- No, John. I'm not.

249
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,439
OK, OK!

250
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,556
You all right, sister?

251
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,111
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

252
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,158
We were on a plane.
Sydney to Los Angeles...

253
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,279
- What?
- 40 of us made it.

254
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,230
Flight 815?

255
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,951
You were on it, too?

256
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,196
What? You were in the back?

257
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,515
- It broke off mid-air, how did you...
- I don't know, I don't know.

258
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,068
The plane came apart

259
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,438
and somebody's fricking hardside came
out of the overhead and knocked me out.

260
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,590
I woke up underwater and...

261
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,472
made my way to the top. Swam to shore.

262
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,950
You been out here by yourself
all this time?

263
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,073
Trying to find food. Making my way,
hoping to find somebody...

264
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
And then, yesterday, they found me.

265
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,475
- Who are they?
- You tell me.

266
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,792
Did you see a boy? Ten years old?
They took my son.

267
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,349
No. I'm sorry.

268
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,793
- I'm Ana Lucia.
- Sawyer.

269
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,831
This is Mike.

270
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,835
The quiet Korean guy's Jin.

271
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,236
We're about to be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

272
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,912
How's that?

273
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,514
Next time Shaft opens the cage,

274
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,832
he's gonna get a surprising little
"howdy-doody".

275
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,714
Are you in contact with the people
who made it?

276
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,394
The film?
Are you in contact with anyone?

277
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,310
Do you think I'd be here if I was?

278
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,475
How is it that you didn't know
about the crash? About us?

279
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,390
I push this button every 108 minutes.

280
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,790
I don't get out much.

281
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,631
So these replacements...

282
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,711
Kelvin died
waiting for his replacements.

283
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,433
So you don't get out, you don't see
anyone, where's your food come from?

284
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,111
- You really think this is happening?
- Why wouldn't it be?

285
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,788
It says "Quarantine" on the inside
of the hatch to keep you down here,

286
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,075
keep you scared. But you know what?

287
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,311
We've been up there for over 40 days
and no one's gotten sick.

288
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,960
You think this is the only part of it
that's true?

289
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,749
Did you ever think they put you here
to push a button every 100 minutes

290
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,752
just to see if you would?
That the computer, the button,

291
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,354
it's just a mind game? An experiment?

292
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,475
Every single day.

293
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,474
And for all our sakes,
I hope it's not real.

294
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,995
But the film says this is
an electromagnetic station.

295
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,275
And I dunno about you, brother,

296
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,433
but every time I walk past that concrete
wall out there, my fillings hurt.

297
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,312
Right.

298
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,070
Oh, no!

299
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,832
What happened?

300
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,636
It's over.

301
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,116
What do you mean "It's over"?

302
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,270
What are you doing? Are you leaving?

303
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,275
Desmond. Wait.

304
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,230
We can fix the computer.
Sayid is coming. He knows...

305
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,356
Give him my best.

306
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,438
Wait, wait! Where are you...
You can't leave!

307
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,157
Where are you going?

308
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,310
As far as I can run, brother.

309
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,551
- What should we do?
- Nothing.

310
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,994
We do nothing. It's not real.
None of it's real.

311
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,594
No...
This isn't what was supposed to happen.

312
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,551
What was supposed to happen?

313
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,839
- Please! Don't leave me here.
- Goodbye, John. You're on your own.

314
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,955
Jack.

315
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,472
Damn it!

316
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,238
Why is this happening like this?
What do you want?

317
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,475
What am I supposed to do?

318
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,712
Helen, what...

319
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,758
Helen, what...
Hey, Helen, wait.

320
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,710
Helen! Don't!

321
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,392
Helen!

322
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,278
Why are you doing this?

323
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,750
He's not coming out of his house
because he doesn't care.

324
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,071
I know why you're here,
why you keep coming here.

325
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,393
You're scared. You're scared of moving
forward, with me, with us.

326
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,111
You're gonna have to choose.

327
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,391
Him or me.

328
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,434
No, no. No, it's not that simple.

329
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,112
Yes, it is.

330
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,718
I...

331
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,831
I can't.

332
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,957
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't!

333
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,597
I don't know how.

334
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,672
Because you don't know
what's going to happen.

335
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,071
None of us do.

336
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,312
That's why it's called
a "leap of faith", John.

337
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,750
You don't have to be alone.

338
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,838
Jack?

339
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,553
John.

340
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,918
Dude...

341
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,275
What is this place?

342
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,279
- John, where's Jack?
- Jack's gone. I need your help.

343
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,280
- What does it look like?
- It's a breaker box.

344
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,079
There has to be one.
Follow the conduit lines.

345
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,754
Cool, OK. Great. What's a conduit line?

346
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,428
Those tubes. Follow those.

347
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,552
Did you find it?

348
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,035
Depends what you mean by "it".

349
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,479
Here's what we do.
Jin plays dead. You call for help.

350
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,994
Sick prisoner? You serious?

351
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,389
What, you got a better idea, sweetheart?

352
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,595
- Where'd you get that gun, anyway?
- What?

353
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,830
The gun, how'd you get it on the plane?

354
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,036
There was a federal marshal
on the plane.

355
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,317
So, what? You just happened
to have his gun?

356
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,029
Yeah. I'm lucky.
Mike, let's get this thing going.

357
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,839
How come you didn't use it
when they grabbed you?

358
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,033
Guess I was too busy getting hit
in the face with a club.

359
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,594
Why are you suddenly so interested,
cupcake?

360
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,159
- Hey!
- What?

361
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,514
Come on, we gotta...

362
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,710
Back up! Back up!

363
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,149
Coming out.

364
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,438
Coming out!

365
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,031
What happened? Who are they?

366
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,674
Damn!

367
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,399
Stop!

368
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,832
Oh, right.

369
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,235
- The code, yeah?
- What?

370
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,799
Listen carefully.

371
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,589
If by some miracle you get
that computer working, enter the code.

372
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,956
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.
Hit "Execute."

373
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,270
- Again. 4, 8, 15...
- Shut up!

374
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,079
- Sorry?
- Nothing is going to happen.

375
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,072
Some... man takes you down there,

376
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,948
shows you a movie,
and you push a button on faith alone?

377
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,108
Nothing is going to happen!

378
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,155
In about 15 minutes, you're either gonna
be very right or very wrong.

379
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,356
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.
I'm not...

380
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,228
Why are you running? You don't
even know what you're running from!

381
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,151
I remember you.

382
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,557
Running.

383
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,914
I know you. I met you.

384
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,992
- Stop.
- Los Angeles. I was training, yeah?

385
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,557
- You twisted your ankle.
- Stop.

386
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,792
You're a doctor, right? There was
this girl, you were worried, you said...

387
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,110
You said you failed her.

388
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,631
- That was you.
- It doesn't matter.

389
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,554
- Was she OK? The girl?
- It doesn't matter.

390
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,790
- What happened?
- It doesn't matter.

391
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,678
- How can you say it doesn't...
- I married her!

392
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,153
Right.

393
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,317
Then, you're...

394
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,119
You're not married to her anymore, then.

395
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,474
See you in another life, yeah?

396
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,711
Can you fix it?

397
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,757
This man, whoever he was,
replaced the motherboard.

398
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,915
- The power transformer is blown.
- Don't you need to know why?

399
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,514
All I need to know is that the timer
is counting down to something,

400
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,233
and that this computer
needs to be repaired.

401
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,959
I'm sure you'll tell me why
once I've done so.

402
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,757
Found it!

403
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,752
- What's that?
- Sayid...

404
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,671
I'm working on it.

405
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,910
- You have to...
- I know what I have to do.

406
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,437
Reconnected the processor.
Replaced the transformer.

407
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,632
It's on!

408
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,712
- OK, so what now?
- There was a code, he made me enter it.

409
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,075
- What code?
- Can you remember what it is?

410
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,394
- 4. 8.
- Wait a minute.

411
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,070
- 15. 16.
- Dude, I'm serious, stop!

412
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,833
- This is not the time or the place...
- I think it is!

413
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,909
23.

414
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,912
- We don't even know what it does!
- 32.

415
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,197
You know what? Forget it.
Go ahead. Do your thing.

416
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,950
It's not 32.

417
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,318
It's 42.

418
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,109
He just told me. Desmond.
The last number's 42.

419
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,631
You're sure?

420
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,950
Yeah. I'm sure.

421
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,318
You do it, Jack.

422
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,156
What?

423
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,711
You have to do it.

424
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,078
- You do it yourself, John.
- No, you saw the film, Jack.

425
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,355
This is a two-person job. At least.

426
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,792
- This argument is irrelevant.
- Sayid. Don't.

427
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,757
- Jack.
- Don't. It's not real.

428
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,479
Look, you want to push the button,
do it yourself.

429
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,189
If it's not real, then why are you here?
Why did you come back?

430
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,197
- Why do you find it so hard to believe?
- Why do you find it so easy?

431
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,316
It's never been easy!

432
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,993
Maybe you should just do it.

433
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,356
No. It's a button.

434
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,550
I can't do this alone, Jack.

435
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,671
I don't want to.

436
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,469
It's a leap of faith, Jack.

437
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,675
I'll take the first shift.
