1
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:30,152
[rustling]

2
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,352
Oh!

3
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,716
You were running
like the devil's chasing you.

4
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,927
Maybe he is.

5
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:22,567
- Good for you, keeping in shape.
- What do you want, Locke?

6
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:27,429
- What do I want?
- I've been here over a week.

7
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,907
You've never said two words to me,

8
00:05:29,976 --> 00:05:33,707
and now you're sitting outside my tent?

9
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,510
We got a man locked up
down in the hatch.

10
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:40,747
There's a possibility
he's one of them, the Others.

11
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,687
- Who's "we"?
- Me and Jack.

12
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,851
He's keeping watch right now.

13
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,918
- How long's he been down there?
- Three days.

14
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:55,299
I'd like you to talk with him.

15
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:58,132
You have experience with the Others.
You were a cop.

16
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:02,402
You're the most qualified to figure out
if this man's telling the truth.

17
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,501
Does Jack know
you're coming to me with this?

18
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,483
We got a serious problem, Ana Lucia.

19
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,543
All of us.

20
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,988
I'm taking the necessary steps
to solve it.

21
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,459
I don't need Jack's permission.

22
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:24,964
Right now there's a man
sitting in a room in my hatch,

23
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,022
and I want him out.

24
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:39,535
[Rose] I don't wanna give you anything.

25
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:42,376
It's the thought that counts,
and you didn't think.

26
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,510
I think all the time. Maybe you should
think about giving me a break.

27
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:48,986
Just hush, Bernard. Just hush.

28
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:51,880
Honey.

29
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,217
Are you all right?

30
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:00,124
I'm... I think
I'm just a little light-headed.

31
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,261
- Well, you look as pale as a sheet.
- Well, give her some water.

32
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,999
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't pay him any mind, honey.

33
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,941
He's just mad at the world
because he forgot my birthday.

34
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,605
I didn't forget. I don't even know
what day of the week it is, Rose.

35
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,081
It's Saturday, Bernard.

36
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,711
- Honey, can you walk?
- Really, I'm all right.

37
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,721
- Maybe we should go get Jin.
- No.

38
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,053
I think I was just
out in the sun too long.

39
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,723
You spend a lot of time around the baby.
Maybe you caught something.

40
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:35,700
- At least talk to Jack.
- Really, I'm OK.

41
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:38,260
Thank you, both of you.

44
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,782
I'll...

45
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:12,060
I would like an iced tea, please.

46
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:14,599
- Very good.
- Thank you.

47
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:16,285
[Locke] Morning, Jack.

48
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,529
You couldn't wait
until I was done in here?

49
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,933
The steam opens up my pores.

50
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:27,530
Man's got no shaving cream,
he's got to improvise.

51
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:32,442
I also thought this might be a good time
to talk about our problem.

52
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:35,072
- Our problem?
- Our Henry problem.

53
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,207
We've had him locked up
for three days.

54
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:42,186
I get the sense that he's just
not motivated to cooperate with us.

55
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,553
And how are we gonna
motivate him, John?

56
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,958
There's nothing we can do.
We need to bring in some new blood.

57
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,189
Obviously you have someone in mind.

58
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:53,824
What do you think about Ana Lucia?

59
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,065
Why her?

60
00:10:57,136 --> 00:11:00,469
She's the one you went to
to start an army to fight these people.

61
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,531
Why not her?

62
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:05,509
Unless you're worried
about what she'll do to him.

63
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:11,578
- I'll talk to her.
- I already did.

64
00:11:13,186 --> 00:11:15,780
In there with him now.

65
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,460
Were you on the plane, too?

66
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:28,593
I was in the tail section.

67
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:31,136
We crashed
on the other side of the island.

68
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:33,968
You walked across? All the way here?

69
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,966
That must have been fun.

70
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:40,035
It had its moments.

71
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:44,575
So, you gonna tell me your story, Henry?

72
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,675
Why bother? I've told it to everyone.

73
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:50,416
Jack, Locke, the big black guy
that cut off his beard in front of me.

74
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,515
Oh, yeah, and my buddy, Sayid.

75
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:57,154
- You see how much he liked my story.
- So, how about you try me?

76
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:01,633
I don't mean to be ungrateful, but why
are you gonna help me get out of here?

77
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,529
On the other side of the island,
there was this guy with us.

78
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:11,805
I was 1 00% convinced
that he wasn't on the plane.

79
00:12:11,878 --> 00:12:15,905
So I dug a hole and I threw him in it.

80
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,408
And what happened?

81
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,557
I was wrong, and now he's dead.

82
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,794
But good news for you, Henry.
I don't make the same mistake twice.

83
00:12:31,864 --> 00:12:34,560
So, how about you tell me your story?

84
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,199
[Sun] Sawyer.

85
00:12:46,913 --> 00:12:51,179
Well, hey there, sunshine.
What can I do for you?

86
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,718
How's your book?

87
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:57,517
Predictable. Not nearly enough sex.

88
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,630
I heard that you have
all the medical supplies.

89
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:13,272
- You heard correct.
- May I look through them?

90
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,673
No, you may not. But if you'll tell me
what you're looking for...

91
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,734
Forget it.

92
00:13:21,814 --> 00:13:23,805
OK. Hold on.

93
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,576
Now I'm intrigued.

94
00:13:27,653 --> 00:13:32,056
Tell you what, tell me what you're
looking for and it's yours, gratis.

95
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,457
Can't I just look myself?

96
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,018
It's not a drugstore, sweetheart.

97
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,160
I need...

98
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,240
a pregnancy test.

['60s rock song plays]

00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:07,715
- I can't hear anything.
- She's only been in there 30 minutes.

101
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:09,784
He might have snapped her neck, John.

102
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,023
How do you know she hasn't snapped his?

103
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,499
So, you and your wife
travel around the world

104
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,094
and crash here in a smiley-face balloon.

105
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:23,700
Then she dies, you get captured
by a French chick who brings you here,

106
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,937
and then they lock you up.

107
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,071
Sounds silly when you say it like that.

108
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:31,674
- Why don't you have a beard?
- Because I shaved.

109
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:35,351
Because I needed something normal.

110
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:40,990
OK. So, why don't you draw me
a map to your balloon?

111
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,257
We'll go out there, find it,
and everybody'll believe you.

112
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,924
They all keep asking me to draw a map.

113
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:48,990
And if I mess up, they'll crucify me.

114
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,628
You flew around the world in a balloon,

115
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,695
and you don't think
you can draw a map?

116
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:57,834
Air travel, it's a different animal.
It's about wind currents...

117
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,902
Do you or do you not know where it is?

118
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:04,113
Yeah, I know where it is.

119
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,988
I went back there to bury my wife.

120
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,884
Why'd you do that?

121
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:19,090
Because that balloon
was the closest thing we had to home.

122
00:15:23,402 --> 00:15:26,098
You people have been looking
for someone to punish

123
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,936
for everything that's happened,
someone to blame,

124

and now you've got him.

125
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,775
It doesn't matter what I do.
I'm dead already.

126
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,781
You draw up that map, Henry.

127
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:46,256
I'll find your balloon.

128
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:49,055
But if you don't,

129
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:52,859
things are gonna play out
just like you said.

130
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,751
Hey, Sun.

131
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,358
Look what I found
in the middle of the jungle.

132
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,958
It's not even melted or nothing.
Crazy, huh?

133
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:33,563
D'you wanna split it?

134
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:36,107
No. No, thank you.

135
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:41,272
I was just heading to the beach.

136
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:45,841
OK. Well, later, dude.

He told me the same story he told you.

141
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,661
- You believe him?
- I don't know yet.

142
00:19:19,738 --> 00:19:22,104
I need more time with him.

143
00:19:22,174 --> 00:19:24,802
- He's all yours.
- Tomorrow.

144
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,368
I wanna give him some time to think.

145
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,740
If that's OK with you.

146
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,911
I didn't tell anyone, Ana.

147
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,281
No worries, man.

Bit large for a dining-room table.

149
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:56,132
If we cut them in two,
it will suit the purpose.

150
00:19:56,775 --> 00:20:00,142
Sayid, can I talk to you?

151
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:05,273
Of course.

152
00:20:06,585 --> 00:20:09,019
Alone?

153
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,985
Whatever you need to say,
you can say it here.

154
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:16,858
- It's about the hatch.
- The guy locked in the closet there?

155
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,155
What about him?

156
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:34,774
It's to his balloon.

157
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:39,216
- How did you get him to do this?
- I asked nicely.

158
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:42,844
Do Jack and Locke know about this?

159
00:20:42,922 --> 00:20:47,689
Jack and Locke are a little too busy
worrying about Locke and Jack.

160
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,395
All I wanna know
is if this guy's telling the truth.

161
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:54,227
Why come to me?

162
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,293
Judging from what you did to his face,
that's what you want, too.

163
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,998
This is at least a day's walk.

164
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,071
Then we should get going.

165
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:26,954
Oh!

166
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,928
- You OK?
- Fine. Thanks.

167
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:45,543
That cliff there appears to be this.

168
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:47,848
[Ana Lucia] Score one for Henry.

169
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,754
Pointing out a touchstone does not mean
he's leading us to a balloon.

170
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:54,816
Maybe not, but at least
we're on the right island.

171
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,955
Humor's not his strong suit.

172
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,701
And I'm saying this to you.

173
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:19,740
- You looking at my bum?
- No, I'm looking at your gun.

174
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:21,441
My what?

175
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,479
Maybe you should give the gun
to somebody who knows how to use it.

176
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:30,753
Maybe I will. As I recall, the last time
you had a gun you murdered someone.

177
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:32,820
That's enough.

178
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:48,042
We'll go as far as the base of the cliff
and we'll camp there.

179
00:22:56,555 --> 00:23:00,548
- [Sun] How long is it supposed to take?
- Up to two minutes.

180
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:09,160
- I'm sorry. I'm just...
- I know.

181
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,867
Where did Sawyer
find one of these, anyway?

182
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:17,636
I mean, who flies
with a pregnancy test, right?

183
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:21,879
Have you ever taken one?

184
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,140
Yeah.

185
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:32,612
Thank you for waiting with me

186
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:37,651
and not asking
why you're here and not Jin.

187
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,888
You're welcome.

188
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,162
[sighs]

189
00:23:47,106 --> 00:23:49,097
It's time.

190
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,847
You're pregnant.

191
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,228
Is it 1 00% sure?

192
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,966
There's only one way to find out.

193
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:21,532
These tests are pretty accurate.

194
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:26,874
A false negative in the first week,
maybe, but a positive is a positive.

195
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,279
- But it's impossible.
- Oh, no, it's possible. [chuckles]

196
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,080
Are you feeling queasy, light-headed?

197
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:36,951
Please, Jack, this is private.

198
00:24:37,022 --> 00:24:39,115
Nobody can know.

199
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:43,560
- You're not gonna tell Jin?
- In time, I will. It's just...

200
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:47,360
It's complicated.

201
00:24:47,432 --> 00:24:51,732
As complicated as Jin being the last one
here to find out you spoke English?

202
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:55,136
Sun, my advice, and it's just that,

203
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:59,940
because I'm the last person to ask
about this, but you should tell him.

204
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:03,504
And when you do, you should
tell him everything, the whole truth.

205
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:10,750
I've gotta get back to the hatch.
Congratulations, Sun.

206
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:15,516
You've been down there a lot, Jack.

207
00:25:16,795 --> 00:25:18,956
Is everything OK?

208
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:22,330
Sure. Yeah. Everything's fine.

209
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:29,764
You OK?

210
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:33,534
Sun?

211
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:37,104
[man] Sun?

212
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,907
[man] Sun?

213
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,645
Sun, are you all right?

214
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:49,254
Yes, I'm fine.

215
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:53,958
You were distracted
for our entire lesson. You're not fine.

216
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:02,663
We...

217
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:05,333
Jin and I went to see a doctor.

218
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:11,674
He said I cannot have children.

219
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,082
I'm very sorry, Sun.

220
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,683
I was glad.

221
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:22,647
I'm not saying you should stay for Jin.

222
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,039
You mind?

223
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,783
You should sleep while you can.

224
00:28:03,462 --> 00:28:06,226
Yeah. I can't sleep.

225
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:17,269
People don't like me.

226
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:22,973
I've tried to get them to
most of my life, but...

227
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,376
I guess I just gave up a while back.

228
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,213
I mean...

229
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,550
I am what I am.

230
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:46,231
But you, you've got
a good reason to hate me.

231
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:56,537
I'm sorry.

232
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:00,348
I'm sorry for what I did.

233
00:29:09,895 --> 00:29:12,489
You were trying to protect your people.

234
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:19,231
It wasn't you that killed Shannon,
it was them.

235
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:25,266
And once we find out he is one of them,

236
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:30,074
then something will have to be done.

237
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,624
[thunder]

238
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,862
What?

239
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,457
Nothing.

240
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:54,095
It's gonna rain.

241
00:29:54,172 --> 00:29:57,539
- We should get moving.
- [Charlie] Who wants breakfast?

242
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:00,407
I have papayas and papayas.

243
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,674
Let's go.

244
00:30:02,747 --> 00:30:04,908
Right. Why eat?

245
00:30:17,662 --> 00:30:19,152
This is it.

246
00:30:25,537 --> 00:30:29,200
This balloon,
it would be rather large, right?

247
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:31,765
Why am I not surprised?

248
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:37,209
- We need to look some more.
- This is where he said it would be.

249
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:42,015
If I'm gonna back your play on this,
Sayid, we need to be sure.

250
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:48,549
I'll divide the area into three grids.

251
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:53,027
We'll search as thoroughly
as you please.

252
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,371
Oh, for the love of God.

253
00:31:14,653 --> 00:31:16,416
[Jin speaks Korean]

254
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:23,821
No, no, no, no. It's not for fish.
No, no, no.

255
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:25,886
Oysters.

256
00:31:27,065 --> 00:31:29,556
Oyster.

257
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:33,400
- Pearl. For Rose. Pearl.
- Ah.

258
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,265
[Korean]

259
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:40,643
No oyster. No oyster here.

260
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:44,876
Of course not. Why would there be?

261
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,941
Yo, Daddy-o.

262
00:31:48,353 --> 00:31:50,844
- Sawyer.
- Way to go, Papa-san.

263
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,516
You didn't waste much time.

264
00:31:53,592 --> 00:31:56,083
I'd give you a cigar, Bernie,
but I'm fresh out.

265
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:59,096
- Sun's pregnant?
- Keep it down, there, Suzy.

266
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,792
I don't think Jin Senior here knows yet.

267
00:32:01,866 --> 00:32:03,527
[garbled speech]

268
00:32:07,205 --> 00:32:09,400
[garbled speech continues]

269
00:37:46,277 --> 00:37:48,268
Daddy-o.

270
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,877
[Jin chuckles]

271
00:38:45,136 --> 00:38:49,539
I... Iove... you.

272
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,531
[clicking]

273
00:39:35,286 --> 00:39:37,618
How is it?

274
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:40,681
"Men reject their prophets
and slay them,

275
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:45,195
but they love their martyrs and honor
those whom they have slain."

276
00:39:45,263 --> 00:39:49,165
So what's the difference
between a martyr and a prophet?

277
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:52,327
Either way,
it sounds like you end up dead.

278
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:55,702
That's the spirit.

279
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:02,302
You in the mood for some breakfast?

280
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,026
- What's the computer for?
- Nothing.

281
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,901
Cereal.

282
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:32,136
Wow. Where'd you guys get cereal?

283
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,112
It was down here all along.
Pantry's full of food.

284
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:39,740
How old is it?

285
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,585
You guys don't know much, huh?

286
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:50,684
I'd be asking all kinds of questions
about all this stuff down here.

287
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,821
You guys don't even seem that curious.

288
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:55,388
Do you want the cereal or don't you?

289
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:01,194
This must be my reward
for good behavior, huh?

290
00:41:01,272 --> 00:41:05,538
I guess I earned myself some goodwill
for finally drawing that map for Ana.

291
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:09,079
What map?

292
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:11,778
To my balloon.

293
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,211
- Did you...?
- No.

294
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:20,986
Wow. You guys have
some real trust issues, don't you?

295
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:26,354
I guess it makes sense
she didn't tell you.

296
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,126
I mean, with the two of you
fighting all the time.

297
00:41:33,037 --> 00:41:35,130
Of course, if I was one of them,

298
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:38,403
these people that you seem to think
are your enemies,

299
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:40,808
what would I do?

300
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,478
Well, there'd be no balloon.

301
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:52,679
So I'd draw a map
to a real secluded place,

302
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:55,920
Iike a cave or some underbrush.

303
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,984
A good place for a trap.

304
00:42:00,898 --> 00:42:02,889
An ambush.

305
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:10,440
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people'd be waiting for them.

306
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:15,135
And then they'd use them
to trade for me.

307
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:19,944
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

308
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:29,018
You guys got any milk?
