I'll fire on three. One, two...

00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,391
You.

- You in charge?
- No, I am not.

Who is?

There is no commanding officer here.

00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:41,132
He left two hours ago for Hillah.

00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,472
Your English is good, Abdul.

9
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:46,671
But you're lying.
And that ain't so good.

Son, we don't wanna be here
any more than you do,

had to go marching into Kuwait.

Here we all are.

00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,912
Buccelli here says you speak English.
You ever do any translating?

19
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,181
Formally, no.

20
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,517
Hell. [chuckles]

21

Fact that you know
what "formally" means... We're good.

Apache helicopter went down
in this sector two days ago.

23
00:03:38,999 --> 00:03:41,331
Our sources tell us
the pilot was captured.

24
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:44,461
It's very important
that we get this pilot back.

25
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,996
He was taken to the Republican
Guard intelligence commander,

27

- Do you know him?
- Yes. He was our commanding officer.

28
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,884
Do you know where he is?

29
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:01,546
When the bombing started,
he fled to Hillah.

30
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:04,647
Hillah, huh?

31
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,356
Yes, that is right.

Welcome to Hillah.

Why?

Go back. I'll deal with this.

What?

00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:01,611
Go back, Ana Lucia.

Looking for you.

00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,546
To hide in the woods,
hoping I would pass you by?

45
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:11,846
I was going to wait until dark,
and then find you at your tent.

46
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,909
Why?

47
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:20,352
- We need to keep moving.
- Tell me where we are moving to.

48
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,759
Trust me.

49
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:27,528
The last time we met, you warned us the
Others were coming, which they weren't.

50
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,967
In fact, it was a diversion
to kidnap Claire's baby.

51
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:33,801
So pardon me for not trusting you.

52
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,434
This place I am taking you to,

53

there is something that will help you,
something important.

As for trust,

take this.

56
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,262
If I'm lying, it's yours to use.

Not far.

[US soldier]
Ask him where he took the pilot.

60
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,827
He says he does not know.

61
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,496
We know for a fact he interrogated
the pilot day before yesterday.

62
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,562
Hell, probably in this room.

63
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,609
Tell him,

64
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:47,737
we get our man back safe and sound,
he goes free.

65

What's he saying?

00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,740
He says he does not know.

67
00:08:21,748 --> 00:08:25,206
I was born,
but I wasn't born yesterday, son.

68
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,379
You don't help me out here,
someone else will take over,

69
00:08:28,454 --> 00:08:33,790
and that someone,
he won't play nice at all.

I am sorry. He does not know.

167
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,591
We liberated your personnel file
and Tariq's.

168
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,458
All we want is our pilot back,

169
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:33,664
so we can send him home to his family.

170
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,235
Tariq will never talk to you.

171
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:44,514
That's why you're gonna
have to make him talk to you.

172
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,483
John. John, wake up.

173
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:04,528
- What?
- Come out here.

174
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,968
[breathes rapidly]

175
00:17:13,346 --> 00:17:15,337
Minnesota, huh?

176
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,116
- That's the question, isn't it?
- [groans, pants]

177
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,993
Wh... Where am l?

178
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,224
- Who are you?
- Henry. Henry Gale.

179
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,289
Ah, my back.

180
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,299
We're going to take it out,
but first I want you to relax.

181
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,931
How did you get to this island?

182
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:46,535
Four months ago.
We crashed, my wife and l.

183
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,603
Crashed in what?

184
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:52,879
A balloon.
We were trying to cross the Pacific.

185
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:58,087
Your wife, where is she?

186
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,618
She died. She got...

187
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,525
She got sick, three weeks ago.

188
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:13,127
We were staying in a cave off the beach.

189
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,605
My shoulder.

190
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,500
At least untie my arms.

191
00:18:18,577 --> 00:18:21,068
What the hell's going on here?

192
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:25,044
Rousseau trapped him in the jungle.

193
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:30,915
- She believes he's an Other.
- Another what?

194
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,925
- You shot him with an arrow?
- Do I have a bow?

195
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:37,994
Hey, hey. You with me?

196
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:44,195
- You were gonna let him bleed to death?
- I was trying to get honest answers.

197
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:48,198
And his wound
is far from life-threatening.

198
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,766
We should let Jack treat him first.
Then we'll get our answers.

199
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:55,302
Jack. Do not untie him.

200
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,121
[trilling]

201
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:11,254
This is how people get killed
in scary movies.

202
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,164
If this were a scary movie, I'd be
with a hot chick, not you, Barbar.

203
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,966
- It's Babar.
- Why don't you shut up, Hammo?

204
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,501
Or your Ranch disorder's gonna be the
new lead item on the coconut internet.

205
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:29,343
Fine. Go ahead.

206
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:33,379
Tell everyone the fat guy's
been hiding Ranch dressing.

207
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,920
The fat guy likes to eat.

208
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,646
Yeah, I'm fat.

209
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:43,127
Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.
You think I don't know that?

210
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:45,627
At least people like me.

211
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,326
Well, find the damn frog by yourself.

212
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:55,068
Hurley, wait. Wait. Hey, Hurley.

213
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,936
Look, man, I'm sorry. All right?

214
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:05,206
But this frog is killing me.
You gotta help me out.

215
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:06,808
Please.

216
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:18,920
[Henry stifles cries]

217
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,533
- [cracking]
- [Henry winces]

218
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:27,899
[breathes rapidly, moans]

219
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,757
- So, what do you think?
- What do you think, John?

220
00:20:49,528 --> 00:20:52,019
I think he's pretty convincing.

221
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,564
Yes, he is.

222
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:01,398
The real problem is there's no way
we can be sure he's telling the truth.

223
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,443
That is not necessarily true.

224
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,207
Does Jack have the combination
to the armory?

225
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:17,454
For now he does.

226
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,754
How long would it take
for you to change it?

227
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:35,603
If you're angry,
looking for someone to punish...

228
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:38,905
Why would I need to punish anyone?

229
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,376
I want to find out who he is.

230
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:50,547
I want the truth.

231
00:21:50,623 --> 00:21:55,356
We both know that Jack will have issues
with what must be done to get it.

232
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:05,567
So, how long, John,
to change the combination?

233
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:08,072
Couple of minutes, tops.

234
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:12,240
Then I suggest you get started.

235
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,920
- Did he say anything while...
- No, he didn't.

236
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,486
He was in shock.

237
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,790
We can't just leave him laying here,
Jack.

238
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,303
People will see him.
It'll create a panic.

239
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:43,205
- Where do you think we should put him?
- I say we put him in the armory.

240
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,607
It's secure.

241
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:49,546
Better to err on the side of safety,
Jack, at least until we can be sure.

242
00:22:56,088 --> 00:22:58,113
OK.

243
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,181
For now.

244
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:31,852
We can pull that cot in here.
He shouldn't be on his back.

245
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,915
Good idea.

246
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:44,292
Sayid.

247
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:48,339
Hey. What the hell are you doing? Sayid.

248
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,672
- What needs to be done.
- [Jack] Hey!

249
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,967
[ratcheting]

250
00:25:49,261 --> 00:25:50,922
[thudding]

251
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:53,895
[metallic creak]

252
00:25:59,504 --> 00:26:02,667
The pilot was executed two days ago.

253
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:07,041
He is buried in a field
four kilometers from here.

254
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,444
I can take you there.

255
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:31,696
Damn it. Sayid, open the door.

256
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:35,269
- Sayid, answer me.
- Jack.

257
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:40,166
Why isn't this combination working,
John?

258
00:26:41,313 --> 00:26:43,543
Did you change it?

259
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:45,446
Yeah.

260
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,877
Why would you do that?

261
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:53,755
- You're raising an army.
- What?

262
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,884
Why you didn't ask me is your business.

263
00:26:55,961 --> 00:27:00,523
But there's only one reason to raise an
army, and that's because we're at war.

264
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:05,628
And like it or not, whatever Sayid
has to do behind that door,

265
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:07,535
that's a part of it, too.

266
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:11,899
What if he's telling the truth, John?

267
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:15,546
What if he's not?

268
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:22,009
[Henry breathes rapidly]

269
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:29,151
Get up.

270
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:33,558
What's happening? [sniffs]

271
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,824
- Here. Let me help you.
- [groans]

272
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,707
You said you've been here
for four months.

273
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:48,109
What?

274
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,343
You said you came to this island
four months ago, yes?

275
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,906
Where am l?

276
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:57,819
Please. Answer my question.

277
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:02,087
Yeah, yes. We landed four months ago.

278
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,924
Maybe more. Who are you?

279
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:07,022
You were in a cave for all that time?

280
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:09,329
Off the beach.

281
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:13,269
- On the north shore of the island.
- How far from where you were captured?

282
00:28:13,338 --> 00:28:15,329
- I don't know.
- How many days walk?

283
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,934
- Two. Two days.
- Why did you stay on the beach so long?

284
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:21,002
Why wouldn't we?

285
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,543
We wanted to be there for flyovers.

286
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,107
We had an emergency beacon,
a transmitter.

287
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:30,348
- What kind of transmitter?
- An ADF beacon.

288
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,955
We wanted to make sure we'd be spotted.

289
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:41,358
Look, whatever you think I am, I'm not.

290
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:47,604
Please, please, just tell me your name.

291
00:28:47,672 --> 00:28:49,799
Your wife. What is her maiden name?

292
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:52,537
- Murphy.
- Where did you meet her?

293
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,546
- University of Minnesota.
- How did she die?

294
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,605
She got sick.

295
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,911
She got sick?

296
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:05,613
It started as a fever.

297
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,182
After two days, she was delirious.

298
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,387
Then she died.

299
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:19,464
[sobs quietly]

300
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,202
I don't know why
you're asking these questions.

301
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,681
I don't know why
you're treating me this way,

302
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:33,217
why I have to explain to you who I am

303
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,685
when you don't tell me who you are.

304
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:39,281
I was 23 years old when the Americans
came to my country.

305
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:44,089
I was a good man. I was a soldier.

306
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:50,226
And when they left,
I was something different.

307
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:53,663
For the next six years

308
00:29:53,738 --> 00:29:56,366
I did things I wish I could erase
from my memory,

309
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:59,968
things which I never thought myself
to be capable of.

310
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,046
But I did come to learn this.

311
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:09,751
There is a part of me
which was always capable.

312
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:15,252
You want to know who I am.

313
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,598
My name is Sayid Jarrah,

314
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,999
and I am a torturer.

315
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:35,972
[trilling]

316
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:41,377
Where is it?

317
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:43,444
There it is.

318
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:46,323
[trilling]

319
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,024
Gotcha.

320
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,433
Dude, nice catch.

321
00:30:58,503 --> 00:31:00,767
Well, I'll be damned.

322
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:03,330
All that noise from this tiny critter.

323
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:09,138
Kind of reminds me of a turtle
I once had. His name was Stewart.

324
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,512
He ran off when I was ten.

325
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,313
Well, that's what Mom said.

326
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,377
I kind of think she threw him out.

327
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:18,479
[tree frog trills]

328
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:24,454
Wow, you're a happy little fellow,
ain't you? [chuckles]

329
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,019
[trilling]

330
00:31:30,569 --> 00:31:33,470
I have an idea.

331
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,530
Why don't I take him far from here?

332
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:42,444
Two beaches away.
Maybe he'll find a Mrs. Tree Frog.

333
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:46,416
That way he won't keep you up anymore
and everyone's happy.

334
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,145
[trilling]

335
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:51,719
Yeah, that's one idea.

336
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,349
Here's another.

337
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:57,156
[crunching, squelching]

338
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,489
Dude.

339
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,661
I hear with a little Ranch
they taste just like chicken.

340
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:35,096
Give you a hand?

341
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:44,405
- Jack, I know this isn't...
- Shut up.

342
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:01,656
Where are the pliers?

343
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,793
Tell me about this balloon.

344
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:09,959
- What?
- This balloon that brought you here.

345
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:13,562
- Tell me about it.
- What do you wanna know?

346
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:16,397
Everything.

347
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:23,604
She's 1 40 feet high, 60 feet wide.

348
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:29,314
And when she's up in the air,
550,000 cubic feet of helium

349
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,753
and 1 00,000 of hot air keep her up.

350
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,985
And if you could look down on her,

351
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:40,293
you'd see
a big yellow smiley face on top.

352
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,327
Why would you travel in that way?

353
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:52,940
Because I was rich.
Because it was my dream.

354
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:59,450
And Jennifer thought it would be neat.

355
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,119
You were rich.

356
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,458
[exhales sharply]

357
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:11,654
I guess I'm thinking of things
in the past tense now.

358
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,255
How's that for optimism?

359
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,233
What did you do to become so rich?

360
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,703
- I sold my company.
- What kind of company?

361
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:23,798
- Mining.
- What did you mine?

362
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,508
We mined nonmetallic minerals.

363
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:33,517
I know. Everyone wanted to talk to me
at cocktail parties.

364
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,784
Give me your hands.

365
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,020
Give me your hands.

366
00:34:53,705 --> 00:34:55,798
- Where is she buried?
- What?

367
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:57,739
Listen to me.

368
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:00,437
You said you buried your wife.
Tell me where.

369
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,736
- What are you...
- Where?

370
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:07,410
In the jungle.
By the balloon. In the jungle.

371
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,784
How deep?
How deep did you dig the grave?

372
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:14,848
- I don't...
- How many shovelfuls of earth?

373
00:35:14,926 --> 00:35:17,656
Did you use your hands?
How long did it take you?

374
00:35:17,729 --> 00:35:20,823
- I don't remember.
- You would remember.

375
00:35:20,899 --> 00:35:22,890
You would remember how deep.

376
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:26,027
You would remember every shovelful,
every moment.

377
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:30,697
You would remember what it felt like
to place her body inside.

378
00:35:31,776 --> 00:35:35,268
You would remember
if you buried the woman you loved.

379
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:40,077
You would remember if it were true.

380
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,251
Did you lose someone?

381
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,723
Did you lose someone here on the island?
Did you lose someone, too?

382
00:35:51,796 --> 00:35:53,764
What happened to her?

383
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:02,639
It was an accident. It was an accident.

384
00:36:02,707 --> 00:36:06,268
The woman responsible
thought she was someone else,

385
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:11,145
someone coming to hurt her,
someone like you.

386
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:14,083
Just, just... This is all a mistake.

387
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:16,643
Slow down here, OK?

388
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:20,748
- Hurting me isn't gonna bring her back.
- You know what I lost.

389
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:23,760
- Tell me the truth.
- No, stop.

390
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:28,265
- Tell me who you are.
- No, no, no. Help. Stop.

391
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,494
- Tell me the truth.
- [thudding]

392
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:33,230
- Tell me who you are.
- [crying] Stop, please.

393
00:36:33,304 --> 00:36:35,602
- Sayid.
- [Henry] I've told you everything.

394
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,231
- Sayid.
- Jack.

395
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:40,334
- [Sayid] Tell me what I already know.
- Open it.

396
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,675
- Open it now, John.
- This has to happen.

397
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,946
You open that damn door,
you understand me? You open it now.

398
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:49,282
- No.
- Now.

399
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,511
[beeping]

400
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:57,194
- [Sayid] You're lying!
- What do you want me to say?

401
00:36:57,262 --> 00:37:00,663
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.
Just, please...

402
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,966
I want you to tell me the truth.

403
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,832
Open the door.

404
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,636
- Let go of me, Jack.
- Or what? Wanna push the button?

405
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:13,233
- Open the door.
- [alarm]

406
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:20,446
It's under a minute now, John.
You better think fast.

407
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:23,510
- You wouldn't.
- What? I wouldn't what?

408
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:26,955
If we don't...
You would risk everyone's lives?

409
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:31,553
You talked me into pushing that button
once, John, but it's yours now.

410
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:33,722
You're the one who won't risk it. You.

411
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:36,665
I don't think anything's gonna happen
when we get to zero.

412
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,395
- Jack.
- You wanna see?

413
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:41,370
Let's just see what's gonna happen.

414
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,805
- [Sayid] Who are you?
- [alarm continues]

415
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:45,103
[Sayid] Who are you?!

416
00:37:50,748 --> 00:37:53,410
OK, OK, OK. Right 1 5, left...

417
00:37:53,484 --> 00:37:55,975
You think I'm stupid? You open it.

418
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,585
[alarm continues]

419
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:07,624
[alarm intensifies]

420
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,861
Hey, hey.

421
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,172
[alarm stops, whirring]

422
00:38:25,249 --> 00:38:27,240
[loud clanking]

423
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:29,548
[whirring]

424
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:31,612
[motor whirs, clanking]

425
00:38:37,028 --> 00:38:39,724
- [whirring and clanking fade]
- [Sayid] He's lying.

426
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,765
[Henry] I'll tell you whatever you want.

427
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,996
He's lying! He's lying!

428
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,060
That's enough!

429
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,080
[Jack] What the hell was that?

430
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:09,756
- He is one of them.
- Yeah? Did he tell you that?

431
00:39:09,827 --> 00:39:12,318
- No.
- Then how do you know?

432
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:17,690
Because I know. He is one of them.

433
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:23,636
I think that's what Rousseau thought
about you once, Sayid.

434
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,108
She strapped you down, she shocked you,

435
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:29,340
all because she thought
you were one of them.

436
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:31,541
He is.

437
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:34,676
- What?
- He is one of them.

438
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:38,711
To Rousseau, we're all Others.

439
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,659
I guess it's all relative, huh?

440
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,482
You got a wife? Kids?

441
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,335
[brakes squeak]

442
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,217
Come on down. Hurry up.
Get out. Get out. Stop there.

443
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,548
Get over here. Keep your eyes peeled.

444
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:48,682
I'll take him.

445
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,729
It's over. We're pulling out,
not going to Baghdad.

446
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,360
Your man Saddam gets to stay in power,

447
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:05,068
which means you, in all likelihood,
will remain in his employ.

448
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,601
I guess you're lucky
you have a new skill set you can use.

449
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:14,777
What you made me do, no human being
should ever have to do to another.

450
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,985
[speaks Arabic]

451
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:34,068
I will never do that again.

452
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,565
Yeah.

453
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,309
Good luck to you, Sayid.

454
00:41:46,217 --> 00:41:49,050
Bus fare back to Ramadi.

455
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,588
Let's move out.

456
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:17,774
There is a man down in the hatch.

457
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,812
A stranger captured by Rousseau.

458
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,012
I beat him.

459
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,850
I beat him badly.

460
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:36,961
Why are you telling me this, Sayid?

461
00:42:39,303 --> 00:42:41,703
Jack asked me how I knew,

462
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,536
knew for sure that this man was lying,

463
00:42:45,276 --> 00:42:50,509
how I knew for sure that he was
one of them, one of the Others.

464
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:55,217
I know because I feel no guilt
for what I did to him.

465
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:09,156
But there is no way I can ever
explain that to Jack, or even Locke,

466
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,599
because both of them have forgotten.

467
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,327
Forgotten? What?

468
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:19,238
That you were strung up by your neck
and left for dead.

469
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:23,838
That Claire was kept for days during
which God knows what happened to her.

470
00:43:23,915 --> 00:43:27,783
That these people, these Others,

471
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:30,150
are merciless

472
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,213
and can take any one of us
whenever they choose.

473
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,188
So, tell me, Charlie,

474
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:46,359
have you forgotten?
