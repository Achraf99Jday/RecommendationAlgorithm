1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,555
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,353
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,398
- Flight 815?
- You were in the back?

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,756
Back up! Coming out!

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,279
Everything is cool, we had a talk and
they believe we were on the plane, too.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,430
Guess we can all sue Oceanic together.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,557
- How many of you survived?
- Twenty-three of us.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,435
I thought you said there were 23 of you?

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,750
There were.

10
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,396
It's been four days.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,832
You know, that's not that long.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,195
It could take two weeks
to find a current.

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,909
I mean, Michael knew what he was doing.
I doubt anything...

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,199
What?

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,673
What?

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,716
- Sun, what's wrong?
- My wedding ring! It's gone!

17
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,235
Hey, man.

18
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,514
It's OK.

19
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,397
Sun...

20
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,630
You'll be with her again.

21
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,517
Soon.

22
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,998
OK?

23
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,310
Hey. I think they're trying
to figure out what to do with us.

24
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,599
I think they're gonna eat us.

25
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,391
All right, all of you, get up.

26
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,675
We're moving out.

27
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,509
Where?

28
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,512
You're gonna help us get food and water.

29
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,238
What, we work for you now?

30
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,392
You're gonna do it because
we have a long walk ahead of us.

31
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,199
A long walk where?

32
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,430
Back to where you came from.

33
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,756
All clear.

34
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,390
Hey, Mike, I think
we ought to stage a prison break here.

35
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,790
Yeah? Well, I want to figure out
what the hell's going on here

36
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,189
before I make decisions
about anything.

37
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,077
OK, people, listen up.

38
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,034
We need to gather
as much food and water as we can.

39
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,237
We travel in pairs.
You move as fast as you can.

40
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,072
Don't make any noise.

41
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,152
Maybe you could just take a minute
to explain to us

44
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,154
- We can swap stories on the road.
- I'm going to go scout before we move.

45
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,075
- This chick needs to be slapped.
- Cindy, go with him.

46
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,152
Libby, see what fruit you can gather.

47
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,994
- Take him with you.
- His name is Michael.

48
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,072
Yeah. Right. Michael.

49
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,958
- Wait...
- I'll be OK, man, don't worry.

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,476
- Bernard and I will gather the fish.
- Fish.

51
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,519
The man knows how to fish.
I'd take him with you if I were you.

52
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,672
Fine. He comes with us too.

53
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,918
Sun.

54
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,992
You OK?

55
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,071
I lost my wedding ring.

56
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,513
When was the last time you saw it?

57
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,033
I'm so used to it, I don't...

58
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,111
I don't know.

59
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,273
I lost my wedding ring once.

60
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,990
It's crazy where you'll look when you
want to find something bad enough.

61
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,277
I went through the...
the garbage outside the house,

62
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,794
emptied the bags and everything.

63
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,348
I even took apart the pipes
in my bathroom

64
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,513
because I was convinced that
it had gone down the drain in the sink.

65
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,636
What did your wife say?

66
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,518
- She never knew.
- How is that?

67
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,355
I went to a jeweller
and I had a replica made, that's how.

68
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,119
Yeah, now it's just rattling around
in my sock drawer back home.

69
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,074
I can help you look.

70
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,709
No. Thanks. I'm sure it will turn up.

71
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,870
Hey! Hey.

72
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,674
You wanna help us out over here?

73
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,670
You wanna eat?

74
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,591
Help us.

75
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,993
Does it look like I speak Korean?

76
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,991
Fish.

77
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,308
- Sorry, Michael.
- Sorry about what?

78
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,871
You know, about... throwing you
and your friends into the pit.

79
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,428
- Friends...
- What?

80
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,592
I never thought about them like that.
One is my friend.

81
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,956
- I'm guessing not the redneck.
- Yeah. Not the redneck.

82
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,795
I don't think I've ever
seen someone so scared in my life.

83
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,271
- And I know about scared.
- That why you threw us in the pit?

84
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,396
Because you're scared?

85
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,472
And we've got... trust issues.

86
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,351
How about that.

87
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,635
Where the hell are all the fruits?

88
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,838
We've picked these trees clean.
Sometimes you find them on the ground.

89
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,629
Why don't you head inland? That's where
all the fruit is on our side.

90
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,359
- We don't go that way.
- Why?

91
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,912
Because that's where they come from.

92
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,233
For your protection when we travel.

93
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,351
You made this?

94
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,915
So what's your name, anyway?

95
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,872
Mr Eko.

96
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,916
Mr Eko.

97
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,516
Yes.

98
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,352
So, what's that like Mister Ed?

99
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,199
- Michael left.
- What?

100
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,717
He just said something
and he went into the jungle. He's gone.

101
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,598
- Let's go. We're leaving now.
- What do you mean?

102
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,672
- Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
- Michael left.

103
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,754
What's he saying?

104
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,839
Walt!

105
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,349
Walt!

106
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,752
Let's go, we're moving out now.
Cindy, water?

107
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,308
Libby, can you carry the radio?

108
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,837
Wait, you have a radio?
Does it work? Can you use it?

109
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,309
Wow! What a great idea.

110
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,359
- You gonna slow us down?
- No! Michael.

111
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,956
We're leaving
before he can tell them where we are.

112
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,031
Michael.

113
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,554
What are we supposed to do?
Wait for him?

114
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,870
He ain't comin' back without his kid.

115
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,997
Walt! He ain't comin' back without Walt.

116
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,272
You really think he's gonna find him?

117
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,197
In case you haven't noticed,
it's every man for himself, Chewie.

118
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,354
Mike's gotta worry about Mike,
and I gotta worry about me.

119
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,431
Wait.

120
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,752
Please.

121
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,834
You're going the wrong way.

122
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,354
That's where he is going.

123
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,237
Toward them.

124
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,558
What are you doing?

125
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,473
I am going to help him find his friend.

126
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,150
We can't wait for you.

127
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,597
I don't expect you to.

128
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,309
All you gotta do is retrace your steps.

129
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,119
Like, what did you do yesterday?

130
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,272
I woke up. Washed up.
Walked with Shannon.

131
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,069
We picked some fruit,
cut it up to feed Vincent.

132
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,075
- Then I was... And, uh...
- Whoa. You fed the dog?

133
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,434
Bingo.

134
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,829
So... Seoul.

135
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,879
Is that in the good Korea
or the bad Korea?

136
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,349
The good one.

137
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,991
Did you go to the Olympics?

138
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,913
Hurley, this is ridiculous.

139
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,309
Waiting here for...

140
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,996
The dog did not eat my ring.

141
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,799
Dude, dogs will eat anything.

142
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,394
When I was a kid, my dog Buster...

143
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,199
I had this drawer
where I'd throw in all my change.

144
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,157
I guess there were Smarties in there.

145
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,279
So the next day, Buster craps out
a buck thirty-five in nickels.

146
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,028
Did you ever own a dog?

147
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,749
Yes. Jin gave me one.

148
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,469
- A puppy.
- What was his name?

149
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,439
- Bpo Bpo.
- Bpo Bpo.

150
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,152
- That mean something?
- Yes. It means "a kiss".

151
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,151
A kiss.

152
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,908
- No!
- Michael!

153
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,877
Wait! No!

154
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,435
His name was Goodwin.

155
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,752
Others?

156
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,357
Michael?

157
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,919
No.

158
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,076
For your cut.

159
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,275
So, you're married?

160
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,271
Your ring.

161
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,635
You have a wife?

162
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,877
Yes.

163
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,073
You?

164
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,519
Worse.

165
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,714
Your wife, what is her name?

166
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,397
Her name?

167
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,074
Sun.

168
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,196
She was with you?

169
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,350
On the plane?

170
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,956
Bad day?

171
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,798
It's clean.

172
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,232
Thank you.

173
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,550
You mind if I sit?

174
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,516
Did you see me?

175
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,114
Rip apart your garden? No.

176
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,756
Sometimes I wish
that I had a garden to tear apart.

177
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,711
I don't think
I have ever seen you angry.

178
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,470
Oh, I used to get angry.

179
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,437
All the time.

180
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,636
Frustrated, too.

181
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,951
So you are not frustrated anymore?

182
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,470
I'm not lost anymore.

183
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,756
How did you do that?

184
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,718
Same way anything lost gets found.

185
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,156
I stopped looking.

186
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,920
No, not that way. Over here.

187
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,229
Around here. This is fresh.

188
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,716
His tracks.

189
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,358
Michael?

190
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,630
Yes, Michael.

191
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,670
They don't leave tracks.

192
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,994
Where?

193
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,669
Where?

194
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,713
- Michael...
- No.

195
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,836
They don't have him.

196
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,712
They came from that way.

197
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,475
Your friend went that way.

198
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,790
Crossed ahead of them.

199
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,711
Very lucky.

200
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,748
You... go back.

201
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,515
I go.

202
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,830
No.

203
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,036
We go together.

204
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,073
Hey.

205
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,233
Hello.

206
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,079
It's pretty.

207
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,432
Hurley told me
that you lost your wedding ring.

208
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,236
I was just sitting here telling myself
it's silly to be so upset about it.

209
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,634
It is just a thing.

210
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,834
- They've only been gone a few days...
- Don't.

211
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:17,072
I am sick of everyone saying
he is all right.

212
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,355
He is not all right!

213
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,678
Claire found the bottle.

214
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,036
The one with the messages inside.

215
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,031
The one from the raft.

216
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,436
Where is it?

217
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,870
I buried it.

218
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,713
Stop.

219
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,949
Can I see your water?

220
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,073
Keep slowing us down,

221
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,435
- we'll leave you behind.
- Go ahead.

222
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,239
All right, see ya.

223
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,233
Got a question for you.

224
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,594
Yeah?

225
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,313
Now that your tracker's gone, how are
you gonna find our camp without me?

226
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,915
Walk across the island,
follow the beaches.

227
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,036
And Eko's coming back.

228
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,076
You married?

229
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,116
What?

230
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,668
Are you married?

231
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,637
No.

232
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,632
Too bad, you seem suited for it.

233
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,710
Funny.

234
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,872
- What about you?
- No, ma'am.

235
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,474
You gay?

236
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,879
Funny.

237
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,397
Let's go. What are we waitin' for?

238
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,152
Wait here. We lost his trail.

239
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,390
I go back and find it.

240
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,397
What are you doing?

241
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,560
- Go back.
- Michael!

242
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,517
Go back, man!

243
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,878
Walt!

244
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,837
Walt!

245
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,911
Walt!

246
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,150
- Michael!
- Look, go away!

247
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,231
I'm not going back without him!

248
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,993
Walt! I'm here!

249
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,752
Where are you, man?

250
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,512
Walt!

251
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,876
You worried they're gonna hear me?

252
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,951
Let them take me!

253
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,395
Come! Come take me!

254
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,438
Shouting is not a good idea.

255
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,638
- You need to come back with us now.
- I'm not leaving him out here!

256
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,280
Stay away from me!

257
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,997
I know they took your son...

258
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,835
...but you have no idea
what these people are capable of.

259
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,434
They will not be found
if they don't want to be.

260
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,915
They took him... right out of my hands.

261
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,594
Right out of my hands!

262
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,354
I'm not going back without him.

263
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,511
You find Walt, Michael.

264
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,198
Can I see it?

265
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,800
Kate, those are private.

266
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,238
Kate, stop.

267
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,231
What are you doing?

268
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,352
We didn't, uh...

269
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,355
I didn't say goodbye.

270
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,352
Sawyer?

271
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,557
Sun...
