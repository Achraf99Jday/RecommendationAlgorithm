1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,311
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,798
The plane was loaded with heroin.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,269
- He said he found it in the jungle.
- Where?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,669
- It's just a statue.
- Just a statue?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,108
Where is Charlie?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,273
What's this?
Because this was in your little statue.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,998
I didn't know.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,516
If it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,799
- You lied to me.
- I'm sorry.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,519
- I can't have you around my baby.
- Claire...

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,239
I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,917
Voltron.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,511
Where are my presents?

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,758
Right over here, Charlie.

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,114
It's a piano.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,236
- This is mine?
- Yes.

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,357
Father Christmas
must've known how talented you are.

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,156
You're special, love.

19
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,630
Someday you're gonna get us out of here.
All of us.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,911
Now...

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,393
Go on. Play us a tune.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,911
Come on, baby brother.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,193
You can't save your family
if you don't play.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,033
Come on, play.

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,476
Play me a tune.
Come on, now, let's hear it.

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,153
He ain't saving no one.

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,391
Music will never get you anywhere,
Charlie boy.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,555
- You need a trade.
- Dad?

29
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,793
Do it, baby bro. Save us.

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,678
Save us, Charlie. Save us.

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,591
Aaron?

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,710
It's OK. It's all right.

33
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,754
Sun. Have you seen Claire and the baby?
They've gone.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,274
- They're right over there.
- Is Aaron OK?

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,191
Yes, he's fine. Charlie, he's...

36
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,631
It's OK.

37
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,957
Hey.

38
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,996
I made Aaron some nappies this morning.

39
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,152
I'll just put those there.

40
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,674
Thanks.

41
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,358
Has he been asking about me?

44
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,273
I should have told you about the statue,

45
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,271
and what was in it.

46
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,279
I just wish things could get back
to the way they were before.

47
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,794
There is no "before."

48
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,074
We were strangers on a plane
and became friends.

49
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,549
Now Locke's your friend, huh?

50
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,350
Please, Charlie.

51
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,159
Just for now, give me some space, OK?

52
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,157
Space.

53
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,273
See you, mate. Take care of your mum.

54
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,951
- Charlie?
- Hey.

55
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,438
What are you doing up?
You should be lying down.

56
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,991
I just needed to see her again.
Isn't she brilliant?

57
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,312
She's beautiful, Karen.

58
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,595
I named her Megan.

59
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,510
Where's Liam?

60
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,439
- He's not here.
- It wasn't his fault.

61
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,990
We were leaving Dresden. I was in a cab.
He was in a van with the gear.

62
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,030
It blew a tyre
on the way to the airport.

63
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,510
He missed his flight.
But he's on the next plane.

64
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,478
- He'll be here soon.
- But he's OK?

65
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,955
He's great. He's a dad.

66
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,998
For the... Liam.

67
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,071
Unbelievable.

68
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,949
Liam?

69
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,794
Wake up. Oi!

70
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,032
What the hell's wrong with you?
What the hell are you doing?

71
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,873
- Baby brother.
- You're supposed to be cleaning up.

72
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,078
Get up.
I told Karen you missed your flight.

73
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,913
She's alone at the hospital
and you're here fixing.

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,390
I'm cool.
I just needed to get right, that's all.

75
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,996
Don't worry. I left you some.

76
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,559
Get right? Why don't you get up?

77
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,552
Take a shower, get dressed,
get to the hospital?

78
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,518
All right. I'm on it.

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,918
By the way, you have a daughter.

80
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,551
Her name's Megan.

81
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,550
After Mum?

82
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,034
After Mum.

83
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,873
Now clean yourself up.
You're a sodding father now.

84
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,437
Easy. That's good. That was good.

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,273
- One more.
- Sawyer.

86
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,272
When you were over there
across the island,

87
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,635
how well did you get to know
those Tailies?

88
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,713
- Well enough. Why?
- That Libby chick seems pretty cool.

89
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,473
I mean, is she?

90
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,916
You got a little love connection
brewing over there, Jabba?

91
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,995
- No. I'm just asking.
- I hear you asking.

92
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,550
Forget it.

93
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,437
What's with you? You're acting
like you're in junior high.

94
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,711
What do we have here?
Ana Lucia's getting the $20 tour.

95
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,634
That's the third time I've seen them
walking out of the jungle.

96
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,715
What do you suppose they're doing?

97
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,756
You just do your exercises.

98
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,510
Bloody hell.

99
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,117
The baby.

100
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,438
Help.

101
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,751
The baby.

102
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,037
Aaron.

103
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,199
I'm coming. It's OK.

104
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,311
Just hang on.

105
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,953
I got you. It's all right. It's OK.

106
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,713
You're OK now. You're safe.

107
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,311
It's OK.

108
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,149
Mum?

109
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,673
Claire?

110
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,514
- He's in danger. You have to save him.
- You have to save the baby.

111
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,989
Only you can save him.

112
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,993
- What are you doing?
- What?

113
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,958
What are you doing, man?

114
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,430
- What's going on?
- What are you doing with the baby?

115
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,311
I don't know.

116
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,435
Help. Somebody took my baby.
Aaron's gone.

117
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,829
It's OK. We're over here.

118
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,232
Is he all right?

119
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,591
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.

120
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,880
He's OK, though. I had this dream...

121
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,155
Stick? I don't know, dude.
Don't I need 21? I think I should hit.

122
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,149
- But I got a six. I'm gonna bust.
- How do you know that?

123
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,312
I don't. But you gotta assume
that I'm gonna bust.

124
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,913
Why?

125
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,509
Well, well,
look who's off to the Laundromat.

126
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,311
Go on.

127
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,596
I'm sure you've got a load
you need to drop in, Jethro.

128
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,319
I'm kind of waiting for my moment.

129
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,671
Well...

130
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,997
Your moment is now, Hoss.

131
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,350
Hey, Libby.

132
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,352
Hey, yourself.

133
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,352
Hey, John. Talk to you for a second?

134
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,037
What is it?

135
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,793
I take it you heard about
what happened last night?

136
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,714
You taking the baby out of Claire's tent
in the middle of the night?

137
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,633
- I heard.
- It was a big misunderstanding.

138
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,995
I was sleepwalking.
I don't know how or why.

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,833
Is there something you want from me?

140
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,229
I was hoping
you could speak to Claire for me.

141
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,550
Put in a good word.

142
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,232
Are you using?

143
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,789
- What?
- Heroin. Are you using again?

144
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,752
Kate sees a horse, nothing.

145
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,593
Pretty much everybody's seen Walt
in the jungle.

146
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,875
When it's Charlie, it must be the drugs.

147
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,111
It's funny,
you didn't answer the question.

148
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,395
You remember the plane?

149
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,439
We burned it. Eko and me.
We burned the whole thing.

150
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,115
The heroin, the statues.
It's all gone, destroyed.

151
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,355
- All of them?
- All of them.

152
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,189
Trust is a hard thing to win back.

153
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,669
Claire needs time.

154
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,638
You should leave her
and the baby alone for a while.

155
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,074
Can you do this? You look green.

156
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,310
Sod off. I'm fine.

157
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,834
Let's give this another go, shall we?

158
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,549
Get it together.
Lest you forget, we need this.

159
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,551
Tea.

160
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,871
- So, you lads ready?
- We're ready. Let's go.

161
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,758
- Let's try not to blow it this time.
- You good?

162
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,071
We've only 20 minutes
till we're in overtime. Get it right.

163
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,388
All right.

164
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,199
- Camera. Rotate on the eight count.
- Rolling.

165
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,793
Hold the product up.

166
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,030
- Butties diapers, take 53.
- Playback.

167
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,839
- Mark it.
- And action.

168
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
<i>You all, every butties</i>

169
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,000
<i>You all, every butties</i>

170
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,078
- <i>Acting like...</i>
- Cut.

171
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,913
- It's all right.
- That's it. We're wrapped.

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,117
No. Mate. Hang on. Wait.

173
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,591
- What are you doing?
- Let's not waste any more time.

174
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,195
You were only hired as a favour
to your lawyer. I wanted Dirt Spigot.

175
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,158
Come on, mate. Give us another chance.

176
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,038
You want another chance?
Take my advice.

177
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,032
Ditch that one. He's a bloody disaster.

178
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,718
I'm not ditching anyone.
He's my brother.

179
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,076
Right. Well, then, I guess you're fired.

180
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,868
Is this washer and dryer
newer than everything else in here?

181
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,872
It washes clothes.
That's all I need to know.

182
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,509
Finally. Someone who keeps it simple.

183
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,034
Look at this.

184
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,839
I got it in some of
the abandoned luggage.

185
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,830
You think I can pull this off?

186
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,637
Let me give you a hint.

187
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,714
When a girl asks that kind of question,
she's looking for validation.

188
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,869
Do I know you from somewhere?

189
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,350
You mean other than the flight?

190
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,640
- The flight...
- Turn around.

191
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,314
Turn around. I'm gonna try it on.

192
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,595
- Sure, go ahead.
- No peeking.

193
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,871
I cannot believe you don't remember
stepping on my foot.

194
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,430
- I did?
- Yes, you did. And it was hard.

195
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,830
I remember you were
the last one on the flight,

196
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,992
and you were all sweaty
and you had headphones on

197
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,756
and crunch, you stepped on my foot.

198
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,477
Turn around.

199
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,637
- What do you think?
- It's awesome.

200
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,631
Thanks.

201
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,354
What are you doing?

202
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,351
I'm marking trees.

203
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,711
Why?

204
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,837
Because these are the ones I like.

205
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,953
Did you tell Locke
you gave me a statue from the plane?

206
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,679
Why would I do that?

207
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,435
He knows, man.
That bald wanker knows something.

208
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,791
Is something wrong?

209
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,872
Apart from me losing my mind?
No. Everything's peachy.

210
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,269
Why would you say
you are losing your mind?

211
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,079
How about the fact
that I've been sleepwalking?

212
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,310
Stealing babies from their cribs?

213
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,473
And the vivid dreams
that make me feel like I'm awake

214
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,677
until, of course, I wake up.

215
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,073
What are your dreams about?

216
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,674
Variations of Aaron
being in mortal peril.

217
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,714
Trapped in a piano.

218
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,711
Drifting out to sea.

219
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,110
There's the flying dove, and Claire
and my mum dressed as angels

220
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,350
telling me I need to save the baby.

221
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,631
What?

222
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,396
Have you ever considered
that these dreams mean something?

223
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,271
Like what?

224
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,033
What if you do need to save the baby?

225
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,995
- I have to talk to her.
- Now's not a good time.

226
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,550
- She'll wanna hear this.
- Tell me and I will tell her.

227
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,350
- Not now.
- Please. Aaron's in danger.

228
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,556
- What?
- The baby's in danger.

229
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,791
I've been having these dreams.
I know what they mean now.

230
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,713
We have to baptise Aaron.

231
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,916
- What?
- We can do this. Eko's a priest.

232
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,959
- It's time to go.
- Wait. We have to baptise Aaron.

233
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,077
He's in danger. We've got to do this.

234
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,235
Here. For when it rains.

235
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,351
Thanks.

236
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,119
When are you gonna tell me
what happened in the jungle?

237
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,192
I already did.
Pull it tighter, or it'll sag.

238
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,475
You told me what that guy said.

239
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,393
You didn't tell me
what made you turn around.

240
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,755
What made you come back.

241
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,831
He had a gun at Kate's head.

242
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,751
You hitting that?

243
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,950
- What?
- Plane crash. You both survived.

244
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,396
Nice beach. She's hot, you're hot.

245
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,198
That's what people do.

246
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,669
I'm not "hitting that."

247
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,751
Hey.

248
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,431
Karen kicked me out, man.

249
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,271
What?

250
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,314
What happened?

251
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,710
She thinks I'm dangerous.

252
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,069
Why would she think that?

253
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,949
Because I dropped her. I dropped Megan.

254
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,870
Liam, it's all right.

255
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,554
We've got no money. We've got nothing.

256
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,479
- What are we gonna do?
- We'll get through this.

257
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,028
Yeah? How's that?

258
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,037
I'm writing again.

259
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,511
I got a new song.
It's about two brothers.

260
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,513
- Who should've been butchers.
- Don't say that. This is a good one.

261
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,991
I feel like this might be the one.
Listen to this.

262
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,556
Nice, man.

263
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,596
- This could work.
- It's good, right?

264
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:26,310
We could make it work.
Write all night, just like the old days.

265
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,233
So, baby brother,

266
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,992
you got any?

267
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,118
I'm disappointed in you.

268
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,999
- You followed me?
- How long you been coming out here?

269
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,476
You've got the wrong idea, man.

270
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,313
You said you destroyed them
and yet here they are.

271
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,560
I came to finish the job,
to get rid of these.

272
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,870
Very convenient,
now that I've found them.

273
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,392
What are you doing?

274
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,040
There was a time when I let you choose

275
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,999
whether or not
you were gonna do this to yourself.

276
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,309
- Now I'm making that choice for you.
- You don't believe me?

277
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,198
Give them to me right now.
I'll destroy them.

278
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,033
I'll throw them in the sodding wind.

279
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,078
I know I lied. Just wait.

280
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,957
Remember all those talks we had?
You and me?

281
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,793
You said
everything happens for a reason.

282
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,910
This island tests us.

283
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,515
That's what this is. This is my test.
That's why these are here.

284
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,751
These are here
because you put them here.

285
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,875
Wait.

286
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,755
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tell Claire?

287
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,909
You can't. If she sees them, I'm done.

288
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,753
She'll never trust me again,
and she has to.

289
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,311
It's about the baby.
Aaron's in danger.

290
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,068
You have to believe me.

291
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,357
You've given up the right
to be believed.

292
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,594
Hey.

293
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,749
Hi.

294
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,071
- How's our boy?
- He's good.

295
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,312
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

296
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,630
Do you think Aaron and I

297
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,837
could stay in the bedroom
in the hatch for a while?

298
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,230
Alarm goes off every hour and a half.

299
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,472
It's not the best place for a baby
to sleep through the night.

300
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,074
Yeah, sure.

301
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,429
How about if I move my stuff down here,
set up right next to your tent?

302
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,230
That'd be great. Thanks.

303
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,550
Then consider it done.

304
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,870
You don't know anything
about baptism, do you?

305
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,918
Not a whole lot. Why?

306
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,911
Charlie came by my tent before.

307
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,270
He told me Aaron had to be baptised.

308
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,871
That he was in danger.

309
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,508
My understanding is baptism is about
making sure children get into heaven,

310
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,511
should anything happen.

311
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,908
Call it spiritual insurance.

312
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,476
There isn't any danger. Charlie just...

313
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,157
Charlie just feels
like he has to save the baby

314
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,629
because he can't save himself.

315
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,949
- I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

316
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,194
Charlie, can you give us a hand?

317
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,669
Now's not a good time, Sayid.

318
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,636
Let's lift this.

319
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,631
I got it.

320
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,030
- Fire.
- Where?

321
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,111
Grab tools, containers for sand,
anything you have.

322
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,237
If we don't stop it now,
it'll burn right through the camp.

323
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,474
Stay here with Aaron.

324
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,877
We need to cut a fire break right here.
Form a bucket line.

325
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,599
Some of you people, down to the water.

326
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,750
Sawyer.

327
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,308
You're heading them off. Right here.

328
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,351
Liam?

329
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,351
My piano.

330
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,311
What's going on?

331
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,150
Where's my piano?

332
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,958
I sold it.

333
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,713
You what?

334
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,197
- Wait.
- Get off me.

335
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,714
Where's the money?
Is it up your sodding arm?

336
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,836
I'm clean. I haven't used in two days.

337
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,832
Two days? Happy anniversary.

338
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,754
- How long you been clean?
- Where's the money?

339
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,673
She was gonna leave me.
She was gonna take Megan.

340
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,355
- What did you do?
- Karen's got an uncle in Australia.

341
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,557
He's gonna get me a job.
There's a rehab clinic in Sydney.

342
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,029
I just needed the money to get us there.

343
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,996
I have to do this.

344
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,153
I have to take care of myself,
for them, for my family.

345
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,871
I'm your family.

346
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,349
Wait. Will you just wait?

347
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,079
- I can't.
- What about the band?

348
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,071
What about the song?

349
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,480
Try to understand. I have to go.

350
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,516
I have to.

351
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,038
I'll give you a call
when things settle down for me.

352
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,511
For you? What about me?
What about my family?

353
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,830
What about my family?

354
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,878
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what I have to do.

355
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,476
- He's got my baby. Stop it.
- It's all right. It's not...

356
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,754
Help! Help!

357
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,479
Somebody, help! He's got my baby!

358
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,232
Come on, please. Stop.

359
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,072
I just want to save him.

360
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,310
- Charlie!
- It's all right.

361
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,516
Give me the baby.

362
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,349
Eko, tell them.
Tell them what you told me.

363
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,635
That the baby has to be baptised.

364
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,154
This is not the way.

365
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,350
Give him to me.

366
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,558
Who the hell are you?
Aaron's not your responsibility.

367
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,916
Where were you when he was born?
When he was taken?

368
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,549
You're not his father.
You're not his family.

369
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,390
Neither are you.

370
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,751
I have to do this. I need to.

371
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,155
I'm not gonna hurt him.

372
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,231
You're hurting me.

373
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,869
I'm sorry.

374
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,160
You need stitches.

375
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,551
Try to be still.

376
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,110
I started the fire.

377
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,551
Yeah, I know.

378
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,558
I was desperate.

379
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,269
I need to know you're never gonna
do anything like this again. Ever.

380
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,996
I know what this looks like,
what people think.

381
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,515
It doesn't matter now, but I didn't use.

382
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,994
I wanted to.

383
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,992
I really wanted to.

384
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,030
But I didn't.

385
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,078
That's not what I asked.

386
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,873
It's not gonna happen again.

387
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,114
Charlie told me you're a priest.

388
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,395
He said you told him
that I had to have...

389
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,914
I did not tell Charlie
to do what he did.

390
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,638
I'm sorry if he misunderstood me.

391
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,992
But do you think
the baby has to be baptised?

392
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,156
Do you know what baptism is?

393
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,716
It's what gets you into heaven.

394
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,153
It is said that when
John the Baptist baptised Jesus,

395
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,234
the skies opened up
and a dove flew down from the sky.

396
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,993
This told John something,

397
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,674
that he had cleansed this man
of all his sins,

398
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,149
that he had freed him.

399
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,234
Heaven came much later.

400
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,670
I haven't been baptised.

401
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,429
Does that mean if you do it to Aaron
and something happened to us,

402
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,109
that we wouldn't be together?

403
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,832
Not if I baptise you both.
