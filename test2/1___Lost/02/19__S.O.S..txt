1
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,312
When's the last time
you went in to see him?

2
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,745
Couple hours ago. He was sleeping.

3
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,546
- Did he eat?
- Nope.

4
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,553
That's two days now.

5
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:58,523
No food. No water. Nothing to say.

6
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:03,157
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of waiting.

7
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,669
I hear you've lost your appetite.

8
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,510
OK. Don't talk.

9
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,920
I was never that good
at bedside manner, anyway.

10
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:36,258
I'm gonna change your dressing. If you
try anything, we've got a problem.

11
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,040
So, Henry...

12
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,606
Henry.

13
00:03:54,681 --> 00:04:00,449
I was thinking about something you were
saying before we found out who you are.

14
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,479
This is gonna sting.

15
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:06,018
[Henry grunts]

16
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:10,859
Yeah, you were saying
that if you were one of them,

17
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,922
that you'd lead us into a trap.

18
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:18,793
Capture our people, force a trade.
Us for you.

19
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,808
Pretty good idea, Henry.

20
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:28,678
And since you are one of them, I thought
now might be a good time to use it.

21
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:34,312
I'm going out to the line
that we're not supposed to cross

22
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:37,083
and telling them that we've got you.

23
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:39,921
And if they want you back,
it's gonna cost 'em.

24
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:46,428
And when we get Walt back...

25
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:52,429
you might just have been
worth all the trouble.

26
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,336
[Henry mumbles]

27
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:59,068
Did you say something?

28
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:04,506
They'll never give you Walt.

29
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,283
Don't gun it.
You're digging yourself in.

30
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,843
- Just tap the gas, lightly.
- All due respect,

31
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,913
I have driven in snow my whole life.
Mind stepping back?

32
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:47,926
You have to rock it out.
You're not gonna be able to...

33
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:49,757
[engine revs]

34
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:56,294
- I'm calling triple A.
- What, so they can send a tow truck?

35
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,462
Trust me, I can do this.

36
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:06,575
OK. Ease on the gas.

37
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,011
That's it. You're doing great!

38
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:14,352
Almost!

39
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:17,146
Go, go, go!

40
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:21,853
Are you OK?

41
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:26,123
Oh, yeah. Sure, I'm fine.

44
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:39,378
Well, thanks for helping me.

45
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:41,277
Sure.

46
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,713
By the way, I'm Rose.

47
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,180
- Oh... Bernard.
- Yeah.

48
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:52,982
- OK.
- Oh, OK. Yeah. OK.

49
00:06:58,331 --> 00:07:01,528
- Drive... Drive safe, now, OK?
- Yeah, yeah. You too.

50
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,379
- Um... Uh, Bernard?
- Yeah?

51
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,916
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

52
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,284
Coffee would be nice.

53
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:27,752
Yeah. OK.

54
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,803
I had to beat back half the group
to get these. I saved them for you.

55
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,840
No way. I'm on a new diet.

56
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:44,502
Nothing but fish and water and...

57
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:46,135
fish and water.

58
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:49,511
Hurley, what are you doing right now?

59
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:51,277
- Talking to your wife.
- Good.

60
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,252
Can you and Libby meet me
at the tree line in five minutes?

61
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,346
And can you get Jin and Sun,
Jenkins, and that frogurt guy?

62
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,448
- The guy who made frozen yogurt?
- Neil?

63
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:02,427
Yeah. And Craig,
and anybody else you can get.

64
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,929
Bernard? What are you up to?

65
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,989
I got an idea.

66
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,791
Hey, Richard, Craig, Jerome,
come here. I got a great idea...

67
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,371
I'm not sure trading people's
their thing.

68
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,774
Well, talking to him
is getting us nowhere.

69
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,609
So, maybe we can get something for him.

70
00:08:22,682 --> 00:08:24,673
You want me to come with you?

71
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,783
You need to stay here.

72
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:36,820
You need it more than I do.

73
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,191
Do yourself a favor, man.

74
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:46,266
- Don't go out there alone.
- All right.

75
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:51,436
[Sawyer] Ha-ha! That's how it's done.

76
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:53,172
Oh, well, look at you.

77
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,340
What,
that's like four in the last half hour?

78
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,748
Let me call the Guinness book.

79
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,515
You want help or not? 'Cause I've
got better things to do with my time.

80
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:06,857
Oh, happy day. Here comes Dr. Giggles.

81
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,192
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

82
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:15,833
I'm going back to the jungle
to talk to our friend with the beard.

83
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:18,268
See if we can make a trade.

84
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:21,330
Ah, the old prisoner exchange.

85
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,332
You're inviting me along
'cause you want a gun?

86
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,878
I'm not inviting you, I'm inviting Kate.

87
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:30,543
And I've already got a gun,
but thanks for offering.

88
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,778
How in the hell did you get a gun?

89
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,877
Does it matter?

90
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:40,322
I'll get my things.

91
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,928
OK, two months we've been
on this island. Two months.

92
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,162
And already we have a water trough,

93
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:53,296
and we've got a food pantry,

94
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:58,037
and people are taking showers
in your hatch.

95
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,104
Have you forgotten
that we all crashed on this island?

96
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:06,481
- It's like none of you want to go home.
- How can you say that? Of course we do.

97
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:10,613
- Why aren't we doing anything about it?
- Dude, we like built a raft.

98
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,355
But, it got blown up.

99
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:17,328
OK. So, what are we doing now?

100
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:20,491
That pallet of food had a parachute,

101
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:22,500
which means a plane dropped it here,

102
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:26,026
which means there are other planes
that fly over the island.

103
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:31,771
So, we are gonna build a sign,
a massive sign along the beach.

104
00:10:31,844 --> 00:10:37,248
So, that way, if a plane flies over or
a satellite takes pictures from up there

105
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:41,583
we wanna make damn sure
that they know we're here,

106
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:43,349
that they know about us.

107
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:47,416
Maybe we should speak
to Jack about this first.

108
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,392
Well, do we have
to run everything by Jack?

109
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:55,264
I mean, he's not the president.
He's... He's a doctor.

110
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,326
You're a dentist.

111
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,469
[chuckling]

112
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,168
[coughs]

113
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,836
Could I speak to you for just a second?

114
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:08,371
Come here.

115
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,485
Honey, it is just a sign.
I don't see what the harm is.

116
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:17,751
The harm is you are telling these people
about airplanes and satellites

117
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,917
coming out of nowhere to save the day.

118
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:23,827
I'm just trying to do something.
I want to get back to our life.

119
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:28,094
Well, the only thing you are doing
is giving these people false hope.

120
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,304
Excuse me.

121
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,405
I have a sign to build.

122
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,510
[Bernard] All right,
I want to get this going right away.

123
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,579
We've waited long enough.

124
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,595
It's just amazing, isn't it?

125
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:06,031
Oh, sure, it's beautiful.

126
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,639
- You're not impressed, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

127
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,704
So, what does God have to do
to get your attention?

128
00:12:15,782 --> 00:12:18,876
Bernard? What are you doing?

129
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:31,957
Rose...

130
00:12:33,733 --> 00:12:36,031
I'd been a bachelor for 56 years.

131
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:42,875
And then I met you
and we just fell into this rhythm,

132
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,570
Iike we had known each other forever.

133
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,646
I had always dreamed
of finding somebody like you,

134
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:52,115
but I'd given up hope that I ever would.

135
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,983
- Bernard...
- I know, I know. It's crazy.

136
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:59,223
I mean, we just met five months ago.

137
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,989
But five months is long enough,
because I knew after five minutes.

138
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:12,833
Rose...

139
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:16,234
I love you.

140
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:20,241
Will you marry me?

141
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,642
Bernard, I'm dying.

142
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,956
I'm sick, and I'm dying.

143
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,863
Would you excuse us for a minute,
please?

144
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,785
I've been in remission
for the last couple of years,

145
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:06,313
but now it's back,
and this time it's not going away.

146
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:11,530
My doctor says I have about a year...

147
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,933
maybe a little longer.

148
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:33,312
You haven't answered my question.

149
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,013
Are you sure?

150
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,492
Oh, I'm sure.

151
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,472
Yes.

152
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,842
Yes.

153
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:08,484
Well, you bunk with a guy for 48 days,
now he doesn't call or write.

154
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,181
Hello, Bernard.

155
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:15,150
- What have you boys got going up here?
- Just working.

156
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:20,666
I got a team of folks throwing together
a big sign down along the beach.

157
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,566
Hopefully it'll get us spotted
by a plane or satellite.

158
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:26,696
We could use all the bodies
we can get to help put it together.

159
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,637
Sorry, I'm busy.

160
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,240
- Charlie?
- Regrets, Bernard,

Good luck, though.

- Yes.

Yeah? Why is that?

256
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,344
Because you chose me to go with you
instead of Sawyer.

257

I asked Sayid first,
but he turned me down.

And I only asked you
because they don't want you.

They grabbed you, had you at gunpoint.

They coulda kept you, but they didn't.

they didn't really want me either.

00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,872
Well, Rose, most of us don't.

317
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:22,338
So, what are you doing down here, John?

318
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:25,850
Can't remember the last time
I saw you out of that hatch.

319
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:30,244
I'm done with the hatch.

320
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,220
Oh, now, you're just frustrated.

321
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:39,161
You'll be out of that splint and running
around the island again in no time.

322
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:42,496
And yet, Jack said
it'd be at least four weeks.

323
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:47,735
But, honey, you and I both know
it's not gonna take that long.

324
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:08,054
[woman] Right this way, Rose.

325
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:15,556
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Isaac will be right with you.

326
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,418
[man] You must be Rose.

327
00:29:43,728 --> 00:29:45,787
Why don't you have a seat?

328
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:53,327
So, how does this work?

329
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:59,735
I sit here and you chant
or pray or what?

330
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:03,372
There are certain places
with great energy,

331
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:07,248
spots on the Earth
like the one we're above now.

332
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:11,779
Perhaps this energy
is geological, magnetic...

333
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:16,057
or perhaps it's something else.

334
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,920
And, when possible,

335
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:23,366
I harness this energy
and give it to others.

336
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,666
May l?

337
00:30:46,825 --> 00:30:48,019
What...

338
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,689
What... What is it?

339
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,725
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,761
I can't do anything for you, Rose.

341
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:05,734
I didn't expect you to.

342
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,319
It's not that you can't be healed.

343
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:20,183
Like I said...
there's different energies.

344
00:31:21,092 --> 00:31:23,458
This is not the right place for you.

345
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,791
Where is the right place?

346
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,828
I wish I knew.

347
00:31:30,902 --> 00:31:32,494
[girl laughs]

348
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,768
- I'll return your husband's donation...
- Don't.

349
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:41,007
I'm gonna tell him you fixed me.

350
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:50,154
I'm going to tell him you fixed me.

351
00:31:55,026 --> 00:31:56,687
[thunder]

352
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:06,827
What did you mean back there?

353
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,535
- What?
- In the net.

354
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:14,375
You said they were sophisticated,
the Others.

355
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:15,879
Uh...

356
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:22,915
Last week when the baby got sick,
Claire and I went into the jungle,

357
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,081
and found another hatch.

358
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:28,923
- What?
- Like a medical station.

359
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:32,896
There was nothing you could use,
it was all cleared out. But...

360
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:37,867
I found some lockers. They had clothes
inside, all worn and dirty,

361
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:41,372
but they were on hangers,
like costumes, you know?

362
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:44,203
And there was a makeup kit...

363
00:32:45,644 --> 00:32:47,942
and a fake beard.

364
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,244
When were you gonna tell me this?

365
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,775
When you decided
to let me back in the club.

366
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:59,113
What?

367
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,718
You can keep one of them locked up in
the hatch for a week and say nothing,

368
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:05,786
but then when l...

369
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,092
We're here.

370
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:12,800
Are you sure? I...

371
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:15,465
That's where
they took the shot at Sawyer.

372
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:21,036
Over there is where they pushed you out
of the jungle with a bag on your head.

373
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:23,307
And right there is where l...

374
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:26,374
where I laid my guns down.

375
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:34,082
Hey!

376
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,355
Hey, I'm back!

377
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,829
You say you're watching us?

378
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,728
You hear me?

379
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:47,738
We've got your man.

380
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:52,235
You want him back,
you're gonna have to come out here.

381
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,714
Come on out!

382
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,408
- Jack!
- I know you're there!

383
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:02,249
- I know you can hear me.
- Jack, they're not here.

384
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,517
I'll be right here until you talk to me.

385
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,316
I'll be right here.

386
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,276
I brought you some supper.

387
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,680
Thanks. You can just set it down there.

388
00:34:39,724 --> 00:34:42,022
Where is everybody?

389
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,900
I owe you an apology.

390
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,632
You don't have anything to be sorry for.
It's my fault I'm here by myself.

391
00:34:54,706 --> 00:34:57,072
That's not why I'm apologizing.

392
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:02,102
I lied to you.

393
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:08,508
Back in Australia...
Isaac, he didn't heal me.

394
00:35:10,488 --> 00:35:12,319
He didn't do anything.

395
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,596
- Of course he did. You're...
- Bernard, he didn't heal me.

396
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:25,094
But that doesn't mean I'm not healed.

397
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,171
[Rose] When you're sick

398
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:34,643
and you have something inside you
that doesn't belong there,

399
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,737
you can feel it.

400
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:42,182
And after the crash...
I couldn't feel it anymore.

401
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:46,583
At first I thought it was just shock...

402
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:52,020
but it wasn't.

403
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,934
It's this place.

404
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:01,935
But you said lsaac fixed you.

405
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,769
I told you that,

406
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:09,644
so that you wouldn't spend what time
we had left trying to do something.

407
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,780
Rose, you could just be in remission.

408
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,290
How do you know
it wasn't lsaac who healed you?

409
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:23,054
- How do you know he didn't heal you?
- I know.

410
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,088
I know.

411
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,973
These yours?

412
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,641
Thank you.

413
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:51,852
You're welcome.

414
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:59,052
Trust me.

415
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:02,356
I know.

416
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,501
You don't want to be rescued, do you?

417
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:19,311
You think if you leave, it'll come back.

418
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,680
And if you can't leave...

419
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,951
neither can l.

420
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,027
We won't ever leave, Rose.

421
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:53,140
I would...

422
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:58,580
I would offer to take down the sign,
but we didn't get very far.

Hi.

00:38:32,991 --> 00:38:34,754
I pressed your button.

It's not my button.

Where did you go?

00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:49,871
I just needed to... stretch my legs.

How long are you gonna wait, Jack?

Until I get my voice back.

432
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:06,172
And then I'm gonna yell some more.

433

Maybe they can't hear you.

434
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,144
They can hear me.

I'm sorry I kissed you.
