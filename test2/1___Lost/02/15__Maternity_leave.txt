1
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:16,411
-Claire, wait!
- No, I can't, John. The baby...

2
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:20,783
No, no, you're not walking through
the jungle in the middle of the night.

3
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:24,119
I'll go get Jack.
I'll send him right back here.

4
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,250
- OK.
- Don't worry.

5
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,565
[Locke] Jack.

6
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:43,105
- What's going on?
- The baby's got a fever.

7
00:02:44,744 --> 00:02:47,212
- A fever?
- Claire was coming here.

8
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:54,043
- He asleep?
- Not a sound all night.

9
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,655
I'll get back here as soon as I can.

10
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,633
- [splashing]
- [Claire] Shh.

11
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:16,403
Hey, hey, sweetie.

12
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,639
It's OK, it's OK.
Mummy's just gonna cool you down, OK?

13
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,341
OK? Shh. It's OK.

14
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,517
Jack?

15
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,151
What are you doing here?

16
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:34,316
- You stay away from us.
- He's infected, isn't he?

17
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:36,628
What?

18
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:43,193
- Your child. He's sick.
- Just get away. You get away from us!

19
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,707
You don't remember, do you?

20
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:56,442
[man] It's a vaccine,
we don't want him to get sick.

21
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:57,710
[screaming]

22
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:01,982
[Kate] Hey, get back! Get away from her!
What do you think you're doing here?

23
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:04,489
What are you doing here?

24
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,549
Just get out of our camp!

25
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:16,666
What happened?

26
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:21,266
What did she say?

27
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,004
She said there's
something wrong with him.

28
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,157
[crying continues]

29
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:50,497
[Claire] It's just not like him.
He always sleeps through the night.

30
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,232
- This rash... Something's wrong.
- Babies get sick.

31
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:55,740
- What about the fever, cough...
- It's normal.

32
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:59,142
- And he hasn't been eating at all...
- Claire. He's OK.

33
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:00,804
It's probably roseola.

34
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,508
It's a virus
that's common in children his age,

35
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,383
- and the rash is a sign of it.
- OK. What if it's not?

36
00:05:07,454 --> 00:05:09,945
What if he caught something really bad?

37
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:13,949
- Like some kind of infection?
- lnfection?

38
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:15,756
Where did you get that idea?

39
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:17,854
Rousseau was here.

40
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:23,766
- What did she say to you?
- She said she knew he was sick. OK?

41
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:27,238
- That he's infected.
- Claire, there is no infection.

44
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:38,340
- He's gonna be fine. OK? Trust me.
- [crying continues]

45
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,352
I'm gonna get back to the hatch,

46
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,912
but I'll come back in a couple hours
and check on him again, OK?

47
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,890
- OK?
- Yeah.

48
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:57,225
Hey. I'm sure that if there was
something wrong, Jack would know.

49
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:05,601
[Kate] Are you sure about this?
We don't really know her.

50
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,670
[Claire] I think she can help me.

51
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,244
- [Libby] Hey.
- Hey, guys.

52
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:14,309
So, you're a shrink, right?

53
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:19,982
I'm a clinical psychologist,
but "shrink" works, too.

54
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,426
Can you help people remember things?

55
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,127
I guess it depends
on what you need to remember.

56
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,801
[Claire] So,
it was our second week on the island.

57
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,271
I was out in the jungle, and l...
I thought I was having the baby.

58
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,333
Charlie was with me,
and there was this man, Ethan.

59
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:42,313
We thought he was one of us
from the plane, but he wasn't.

60
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:44,282
So, he took me. He took both of us.

61
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,184
And I don't remember...
I don't remember anything.

62
00:06:48,254 --> 00:06:52,054
When Jack and I found Charlie,
he was hanging from a tree, by his neck.

63
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,184
I have no idea what happened,

64
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,229
and now I'm seeing these flashes
of things and...

65
00:06:57,297 --> 00:06:58,787
You know, I have amnesia.

66
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,390
There's two weeks missing from my life.

67
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,834
Claire, I don't think you have amnesia.

68
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,837
Sometimes
when something terrible happens,

69
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,340
there's a little switch in your head
that flicks on

70
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,344
to protect us
from having to deal with it.

71
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:14,972
Maybe your memories aren't gone.

72
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:17,414
Maybe you're just blocking them.

73
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:22,878
Then I need you to unblock them.

74
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,583
Because my baby's sick,
and they did something to him.

75
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,322
[door creaks]

76
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,506
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No.

77
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:48,479
- Well, just let us know when you do.
- Yeah, I'll look forward to that.

78
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,445
Thought you might like
something to read.

79
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,319
Dostoyevsky.

80
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:02,592
- You don't have any Stephen King?
- Mm-mm. Library's a little outdated.

81
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:04,596
Right.

82
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:06,359
Well, thanks.

83
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:13,896
What's with the book?

84
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:16,641
Just something to pass the time.

85
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,613
Did you know that Hemingway
was jealous of Dostoyevsky?

86
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,815
No, John, I didn't know that.

87
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,252
He wanted to be
the world's greatest writer,

88
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:31,722
but convinced himself
that he could never get out

89
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,691
from under Dostoyevsky's shadow.

90
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,285
Kind of sad, really.

91
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,853
What are we doing, Jack?

92
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,333
- What are we doing?
- We can't hide him down here forever.

93
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,893
Changing shifts will
get people asking questions.

94
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,906
I just want to know
what the long-term plan is.

95
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:51,833
Well, John, let me ask you this:

96
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,209
we don't have a long-term plan
for the button,

97
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,544
but we keep pushing it, don't we?

98
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:03,781
Look, until we know who he is,
whether or not he's telling the truth,

99
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:06,121
we have to keep doing what we're doing.

100
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,760
If you've a better idea, let's hear it.

101
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:11,296
[Henry, muffled]
How about you let me go?

102
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,992
[Aaron cries]

103
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:23,474
[Libby] Now we're away
from all the noises of the camp.

104
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,341
Just breathe.

105
00:09:26,412 --> 00:09:28,972
Let your whole body relax.

106
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,784
Good. Listen to the waves.

107
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:39,457
Good. In...

108
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,961
...and out, slowly.

109
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,395
Good.

110
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:49,031
Keep your eyes closed.

111
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,430
Very relaxed, Claire.

112
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,900
Just keep breathing.

113
00:09:56,976 --> 00:10:01,709
Now, I want you to visualize yourself
when you were pregnant.

114
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,984
Keep listening to my voice.

115
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,883
Think about what you see.

116
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:19,527
[man] We don't want him to get sick.

117
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,089
[screaming]

118
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:22,259
[Muzak plays]

119
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,667
[man]
When was your last checkup, Claire?

120
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:28,138
Oh, I haven't been in a while.

121
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,198
I've been busy.

122
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,245
- I'm going to Los Angeles.
- Really?

123
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:35,611
- Yeah.
- Traveling in your third trimester,

124
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:39,448
- that's not usually recommended.
- Well, there's a family there.

125
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,216
I'm, uh,
giving the baby up for adoption.

126
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,689
Oh. Of course. I understand.

127
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,291
The sedative I gave you was very mild.

128
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,957
I know these exams
can be very stressful.

129
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,899
I'm going to give you a shot now,
Claire.

130
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,198
A little medicine for your baby.

131
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:17,750
Don't worry,
you're just gonna feel a little pinch.

132
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,330
- [screams, gasps]
- It's OK!

133
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,889
It's OK, it's OK.

134
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,401
It was Ethan! I saw Ethan!

135
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,665
I saw him! It was Ethan!

136
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:37,569
[Libby] It's OK.

137
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:38,974
- No!
- You're all right.

138
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,445
- No! I'm not all right!
- It was Ethan!

139
00:11:41,514 --> 00:11:44,506
- What happened? What did you do?
- Nothing! She...

140
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,179
- Do it again. Do it again!
- No, Claire, you were screaming.

141
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,949
But I remembered! OK?

142
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:53,288
I saw Ethan. He was there
and he was giving me an exam.

143
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,851
What you saw could be combining
experiences from before the crash

144
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:00,524
- to things that happened to you here.
- No! No! This was real. OK?

145
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,864
I was drugged.

146
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:05,199
- He did something to me.
- Calm down.

147
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,468
- It's not good for Aaron...
- You know what? Aaron is sick.

148
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,907
I need to find that place, that room.

149
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:13,172
It's real. It's real. OK?

150
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:16,340
And there's medicine there for the baby.

151
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,475
I need to find it. I need to find it.

152
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:25,554

00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,263
Hello, John.

161
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,904
- You are alone?
- Not anymore.

162
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,534
- [hushed] How many...
- Shut up.

163
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,905
I was hoping to borrow a saw.

164
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,378
Absolutely. Right this way.

165
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:44,297
I need a gun,
and you don't get to ask why.

166
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:50,071
Well, Thelma, seeing as
I got all the guns, I do get to ask why.

167
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:53,010
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

168
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:55,603
Watch.

169
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,777
- Why?
- Just give me a gun, Sawyer.

170
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,914
Check it out. Found a new pair of
glasses, damn near my prescription.

171
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,653
You like 'em?

172
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:14,331
All right, I'm going into the jungle
to track down Rousseau.

173
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
The French chick? What for?

174
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:20,494
Claire thinks she knows where
there might be some medicine.

175
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:22,200
The baby's sick.

176
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,733
- Well, hell, I got medicine.
- She thinks he's really sick.

177
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,802
As in "quarantine" sick.

178
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:33,181
- What do you think?
- I think she's a little too worried.

179
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,415
But she's going after Rousseau
with or without me.

180
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,287
No boys allowed, huh?

181
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:49,362
All right, what do you want?
Nine millimeter or rifle?

182
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,101
[Aaron moans]

183
00:14:56,142 --> 00:15:00,078
I don't think this is a good idea.
Maybe you should listen to Jack.

184
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:03,547
What if Jack's wrong? He said
the fever would break, and it hasn't.

185
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:06,517
- He's getting worse.
- Just because it hasn't broken...

186
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,918
How long am I supposed to wait, Sun?

187
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,292
A mother should not leave her child.

188
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,191
I'm sorry, are you a mother?

189
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,265
No.

190
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,826
I'm not.

191
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,836
Claire,
are you sure you want to do this?

192
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:38,643
- What did you say?
- Are you sure you want to do this?

193
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:44,388
- [Ethan] You need to be sure.
- [woman] You have to get out of here.

194
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,780
[Muzak plays]

195
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:54,031
Do you have to put that in my tummy?

196
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,534
It really, really hurts.

197
00:15:56,602 --> 00:15:58,627
I know.

198
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,968
I wish there was another way...

199
00:16:02,074 --> 00:16:04,838
...but the baby needs it, Claire, OK?

200
00:16:07,013 --> 00:16:08,480
OK.

201
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,759
There. All done.

202
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,818
That wasn't so bad, was it?

203
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:26,895
No.

204
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,659
And now,
because you've been such a good girl,

205
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:32,727
I think it's time for a surprise.

206
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,670
[electrical hum]

207
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,857
Claire, this way, here we go.

208
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,089
Over here.

209
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:07,431
[gasps] What is this place?

210
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,337
It's for your baby, Claire.

211
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:11,308
Oh, it's amazing.

212
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:22,486
What happened to Charlie?

213
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:26,491
Charlie? Oh, he's fine. When we got far
enough from camp, I let him go back.

214
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:29,255
Oh.

215
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,361
So, where did it all come from?

216
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:35,195
Ha! I'd love to explain
everything to you, Claire,

217
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,430
but I'm afraid it would be
a little overwhelming right now.

218
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:49,610
Go ahead. Turn it on.

219
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,951
[tinkling melody]

220
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:08,259
- [man] Ethan!
- Wait here, I'll be right back.

221
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,701
OK.

222
00:18:16,308 --> 00:18:18,003
[man] What the hell happened?

223
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:21,740
You were supposed to make the list
and then bring her in. Was I unclear?

224
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,179
[Ethan] It's not my fault.

225
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,843
They knew I wasn't on the plane.
They had a manifest.

226
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,148
Well, what am I supposed to tell him?

227
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:33,354
Do you know what he's going to do
when he finds out? Damn it, Ethan.

228
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,860
[woman] Get out. Get out of here.

229
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,665
[Aaron cries]

230
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:49,500
[Sun] Claire?

231
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,510
Claire? Are you all right?

232
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:56,780
I, um...

233
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:04,186
Ready to go?

234
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:08,790
Sweetheart, shh.

235
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,523
Mummy's gotta go now, sweetheart, OK?

236
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:14,532
Shh, don't cry, don't cry, it's OK.

237
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,502
I'll be back really soon and I'll make
you feel all better, OK? I promise.

238
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,807
- Thanks.
- OK.

239
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:38,446
- You OK?
- Yeah.

240
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,950
[running water]

241
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:49,028
[Claire] You're sure this is her trail?

242
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,901
We started at the exact spot
where we chased her off the beach.

243
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:56,339
- So, what do you know about Rousseau?
- Not much.

244
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:59,309
You spent time with her
when you went to the Black Rock.

245
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:01,608
You must have talked about something.

246
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,549
Just about her ship crashing here
and her research team getting stranded.

247
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:08,678
What happened to them?

248
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,750
They died.

249
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,285
How?

250
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:19,595
- Tracks are gone. Trail ends here.
- Kate, how did they die?

251
00:20:21,534 --> 00:20:24,697
- She killed them.
- What?

252
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:27,603
- Why would she...
- Because they were infected.

253
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,707
You believe me now, don't you?

254
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,270
I want you to take me back there.

255
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,178
- Back?
- To where I scratched you.

256
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:42,311
- Claire...
- No, OK, she knows I remember.

257
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,015
OK, I remember a lot of it now.

258
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:49,721
I remember the room,
the medicine, a teenage girl...

259
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:53,663
OK? So don't lie to me and make out
you don't know what I'm talking about.

260
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:57,031
My baby is sick. You're gonna
take me there to get what he needs.

261
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:58,660
Right now.

262
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,665
It's not far from here.

263
00:21:18,157 --> 00:21:21,558
Jack, may I have a word with you?

264
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,260
Sure.

265
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,963
- Who is he?
- What?

266
00:21:29,969 --> 00:21:32,494
The man that you are keeping
in the hatch.

267
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,837
- Did Locke...
- Locke did not tell me anything.

268
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,904
Who is he?

269
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:50,615
- I wish to speak to him.
- Speak to him about what?

270
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,748
I wish to speak to him alone.

271
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,450
Can you arrange this?

272
00:21:57,162 --> 00:21:59,153
Why should I do that?

273
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,365
Because you wish to keep this a secret.

274
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,718
Why are we stopping here?

275
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,922
This is where you scratched me.

276
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,290
[Claire] But there's nothing here.

277
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:39,294
- Where do we go next?
- Why are you asking me that?

278
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:42,465
- You need to tell me where to go.
- Where is this room?

279
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,669
How can you be saying that?
OK, you grabbed me.

280
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:49,077
I scratched you because
you were taking me back to them!

281
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,082
Is that what you think?

282
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:56,682
You said you remembered!
That's why I brought you here!

283
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:01,784
- You lied!
- Hey! Get your hands off of her!

284
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,998
Go ahead.

285
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,507
Please.

286
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:20,606
Do it.

287
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:33,283
- [Kate] Claire!
- [thunder rumbles]

288
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,997
[Kate] Claire!

289
00:23:55,714 --> 00:23:57,011
Wake up.

290
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:02,878
- How's it coming?
- One down, one to go.

291
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:05,321
All we need is a little foot
to put it on, huh?

292
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,358
[Claire giggles]

293
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:12,762
Tell you what. What do you say
we sneak out of here and take a walk?

294
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,560
OK. [giggles]

295
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:20,866
Whoa! I'm sorry this is the first time
I've managed to get you out.

296
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:23,533
- My friends are afraid you'll run away.
- Whoops!

297
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:27,272
- Whoa! Don't tell on me, OK?
- OK.

298
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:31,646
- Whoa. Easy now. All right.
- [Claire giggles]

299
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:34,277
- Easy. [chuckles] Easy!
- [Claire] Whoo!

300
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,844
- Whoa.
- Yeah!

301
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,753
OK, here, this'll help.

302
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,757
Oh, thanks.

303
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,496
- Mm.
- What?

304
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,965
- That is really sour.
- Is it?

305
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,934
- Mmm!
- I hadn't noticed.

306
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,360
[Claire] Blah!

307
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,467
Oh! Hey, he's kicking!

308
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,412
- May l?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

309
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:10,150
- Claire, can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

310
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:13,589
I'm going to miss you. I...

311
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:18,058
I wish you didn't have to go.

312
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,726
Well, maybe I don't have to go.

313
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:25,536
We've been through this, Claire.

314
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,573
There's not enough vaccine
for you and the baby.

315
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,302
- But I'm not... I'm not sick.
- Thank God.

316
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,105
And once you've delivered,

317
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:36,739
you can go back to your friends
and hopefully you'll stay that way.

318
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,981
But, what...
What if I want to see the baby?

319
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:49,993
Hey, nobody is going to take him
from you unless that's what you want.

320
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:52,688
You have a choice.

321
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:01,604
We're good people, Claire.
We're a good family.

322
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:08,708
But if you're going to trust us with
your child, I want you to be sure.

323
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:14,342
OK?

[thunder rumbles]

325
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:30,861
Sure.

326
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:36,200
There you are.

327
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,443
Where are you going?

328
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:49,082
[Claire] I know this is it. It's here.

329
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,883
[Kate] Claire?

330
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:57,891
- Leave her alone.
- Excuse me?

331
00:26:57,963 --> 00:27:00,955
- Let her look.
- Look for what?

332
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,763
Claire!

333
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:13,042

[Kate] Flashlights.

337
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:49,467
No lights. I'm gonna see
if I can turn the power on. You OK?

338
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:57,610
This way.

[thud of switch]

What is this place?

341
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,917
It's where they were going to keep him.

342
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,913
[woman] Wake up!

343
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,479
Wake up.

344
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,590
- [Claire] Who are you?
- Shh!

345
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,925
They'll hear you.
Look, you have to get out of here.

346
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:54,727
- What?
- You have to get out of here. Now.

347
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,563
- What? No, no, no. I can't leave.
- Yes, you can.

348
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:00,503
- I can't leave! No!
- Come on.

349
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:02,904
- What are you doing?
- Shh!

350
00:31:05,076 --> 00:31:06,304
Shh.

351
00:31:10,482 --> 00:31:11,972
Don't scream.

352
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:18,550
- They're gonna do it tonight.
- What? Do what?

353
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:20,386
- Shh!
- What are you talking about?

354
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,757
You are going to die.
They are gonna cut him out of you.

355
00:31:24,496 --> 00:31:27,294
I can get you back to your camp,
but we have to leave now.

356
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,491
Hey, you're lying!

357
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,502
- You're lying! OK? I'm sure about this!
- Shh!

358
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,333
- I want to talk to Ethan.
- Stop!

359
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:36,203
- Ethan wouldn't hurt me.
- Shh!

360

[woman]
You'll thank me for this one day.

[Ethan] It's a vaccine.

We don't want him to get sick.

363

It's here. The medicine's here.

Help! Kate! Come here, I need some help!

- Help me out with this.
- What is it?

00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:13,668
It's in here. The vaccine's in here!

OK, come on.

[Kate] OK.

It was in here! The vaccine was in here!

Where is it? Where is it?

The vaccine was in here! Where is it?

374
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,204
You were bringing me back here!
Where is it?

You know where it is, don't you?
Tell me! Tell me where it is!

Hey, hey, Ethan! Ethan!

I'm... I'm sure!
I want you to take the baby.

Who are... Who are you?

- [Ethan] Claire?
- Yeah! I'm here!

387
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:02,753
- [Ethan] I can hear you! Where are you?
- Quiet!

00:34:02,821 --> 00:34:05,619
- I'm here, Ethan!
- Be quiet.

389
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,453
I have to give him to them.

390
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,221
I have to give him to them
so he'll be safe. OK?

Help! I'm here! Ethan! [muffled cry]

- [Ethan] Claire!
- [Claire yells]

00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:20,164
[Ethan] Claire! Where are you?

394
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:32,674
You weren't trying to take me back,
were you?

395
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:37,486
You were trying to save me.

396
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,518
I carried you on my back to your camp.

397
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,319
I left you where they would find you.

398
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,761
I'm sorry.

399
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,035
Where are you going?

400
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:07,012
You're not the only one who didn't
find what they were looking for.

401
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,509
This is as far as I go.

402
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:44,721
Your baby...

403
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:48,592
...was it a girl?

404
00:35:49,594 --> 00:35:52,119
- Yes.
- What was her name?

405
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:56,361
Alex.

406
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:58,892
Alexandra.

407
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:07,838
I remember a girl.

408
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:10,771
A girl with blue eyes.

409
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:17,877
She, uh... She helped me. She saved me.

410
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:19,753
Just like you did.

411
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:23,160
She wasn't like the others.

412
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,355
She was good.

413
00:36:41,446 --> 00:36:45,883
I am sorry that you didn't
find what you were looking for.

414
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,781
And I hope your baby is not infected.

415
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,723
But if it is...

416
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:03,431
...I hope you know what must be done.

Well, there you go.

420
00:37:45,877 --> 00:37:50,712
Just be careful what you say to him.
He's smart and curious.

421
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:55,617
- Just give us a shout when you're done.
- And if the alarm goes off...

422
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:58,053
...don't tell him what it's for.

423
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:00,181
What is it for?

I am Mr. Eko.

Do you mind if I sit, Henry?

428
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:40,353
OK.

429
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:52,736
How long have you been in here?

430
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:57,444
- Two days.
- Are they treating you well?

431
00:38:58,983 --> 00:39:00,883
Treating me well?

432
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:05,081
I'm a... a prisoner.

433
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,124
- And I don't know why or for what or...
- You are a prisoner

434
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:12,219
because they are being careful.

435
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:17,592
They are being careful
because they believe you are lying.

436
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,660
Why would I lie?

437
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:23,137
They think I'm one of these Others?

438
00:39:23,207 --> 00:39:26,665
- Other what?
- Please stop talking, Henry.

The first night I spent on this island,

440
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:37,843
I was dragged into the jungle
by two men.

441
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:43,291
They never spoke a word to me,
nor I to them.

442
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:47,590
I killed these men.

443
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,058
Smashed in their head with a stone.

444
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,898
Felt their blood on my arms.

445
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:02,142
I need you to know
how sorry I am for this.

446
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:10,048
I need you to know
that I am back on a righteous path now

447
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,146
and that I regret my actions.

448
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,726
I ask you for your forgiveness.

449
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,300
Why are you telling me this?

450
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,499
Because I needed to tell someone.

451
00:41:11,582 --> 00:41:14,847
- [Eko knocks]

00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:26,222
- The rash has even started to fade.
- Thank you so much.

454
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:28,922
I didn't do anything.

455
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,561
- I'll check back in a couple hours, OK?
- OK.

when you were still inside her tummy.

00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:15,371
You know, I wanted them to take you.

461
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:26,817
But now I know. Now I know
that we're supposed to be together.

462
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:33,886
You and me. We're supposed
to take care of each other, OK?

00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:44,169
You're mine.

Yes.

- No cheeseburgers, huh?
- No cheeseburgers.

Bon appetit.

Is that true
what you said about Hemingway?

- You have good ears.
- You have thin doors.

- You read Hemingway?
- Sure.

Fought in the Spanish Civil War.

Stuff I can wrap my brain around.
This, I can't get through five pages of.

Hmm.

474
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:50,602
Dostoevsky had his virtues, too.

475
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:53,405
He was a genius, for one.

00:43:57,648 --> 00:43:59,206
So which one are you?

478
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:04,052
- I'm sorry?
- Are you the genius?

479
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:09,218
Or are you the guy who always feels like
he's living in the shadow of the genius?

480
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,559
I was... [sighs]

481
00:44:14,432 --> 00:44:18,095
I was never very much
into literary analysis.

482
00:44:25,142 --> 00:44:28,441
I just don't understand
why you let the doctor call the shots.

483
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:33,440
No one calls the shots.

484
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,981
Jack and I make decisions together.

485
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,891
Right. OK.

486
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:44,721
[coughs]

487
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:48,956
My mistake.
