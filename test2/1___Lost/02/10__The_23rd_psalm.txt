00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,759
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,113
- Are you sure you really want to?
- I've made my choice.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,479
- Where's it come from?
- Based on the maps, Nigeria.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,711
- Anyone on board?
- Two men dressed as priests.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,759
- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,638
The plane was loaded with heroin.

7
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,353
Kill him.

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,389
Shoot him. Now.

9
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,993
Shoot him!

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,194
Do it.

11
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,911
What's your name, boy?

12
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,557
What's your name, boy?

13
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,551
Eko.

14
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,476
Look at Mr Eko. No hesitation.

15
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,999
A born killer.

16
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,591
Come.

17
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,716
You won't need that anymore.

18
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,759
Back.

19
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,271
What are you writing?

20
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,757
Things I need to remember.

21
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,469
Do you mind if I sit?

22
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,790
- Please.
- Thanks.

23
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,950
- So, you're Eko, huh?
- Yes.

24
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,715
Claire. And this is Aaron.

25
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,551
Aaron? The brother of Moses.

26
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,950
That must've been tough to live up to.

27
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,068
Everyone saying, "Why can't you be
more like your brother Moses?"

28
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,071
I'm sure it was.

29
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,790
Why did you choose it? Aaron?

30
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,468
I just liked it.

31
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,237
Aaron was a great man.

32
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,869
Moses had great difficulty speaking,

33
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,793
so it was Aaron who spoke for him.

34
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,679
So, you're religious, huh?

35
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,231
You should speak to Charlie.

36
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,675
He doesn't want to admit he's religious,

37
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,356
but he carries around
a statue of the Virgin Mary.

38
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,071
Statue?

39
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,039
He said he found it on the island.
Weird, right?

40
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,795
May I see it?

41
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,557
- Where did he find this?
- He said he found it in the jungle.

44
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,358
- It's just a statue.
- Just a statue?

45
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,271
Where is Charlie?

46
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,196
You breaking in or breaking out?

47
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,911
I used to love those old silent movies
where the robbers would crack a lock

48
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,197
with their ear pressed up
against the safe.

49
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,159
The money they stole was always in a
white bag with a big dollar sign on it.

50
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,312
Silent movies, huh?
You're not that old, man.

51
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,075
- I'm old enough.
- You setting the combination?

52
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,153
With the new folks joining us, we better
limit people's access to the guns.

53
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,392
Can't have just anyone who wants one
walk in and help themselves.

54
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,109
Which, I'm guessing,
is why you're here, Michael.

55
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,992
Jin, do you like The Kinks?

56
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,270
- Keens?
- No, the Kinks.

57
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,874
With a "K" at the end.
A kicking "K". "K", Kinks?

58
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,191
It's a good tune.

59
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,473
Thank you very much.
I do have a beautiful voice.

60
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,634
- Where did you find this?
- What happened?

61
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,598
- Where did you find it?
- I found it in the jungle.

62
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,717
Take me there.
This is not your business.

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,476
- Take me to where you found it.
- Fine. We'll go for a stroll.

64
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,676
There's nothing there. In the morning.

65
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,591
We're going now.

66
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,229
OK. Let me tell Claire,
so she doesn't get the wrong idea.

67
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,038
Tell her on the way.

68
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,834
Get us some beers. Go.

69
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,838
- Where did you find this?
- What does it matter?

70
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,074
- Same in the other bag?
- Yes.

71
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,155
Fifty.

72
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,151
Fifty what?

73
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,352
50 is what I will pay you in exchange
for the favour you are asking me to do.

74
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,629
A favour?

75
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,790
You have a large quantity of heroin

76
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,031
in a country that has no poppies
and no market for its sale.

77
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,079
Your drugs are of no value here,
so you must get them out.

78
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,551
The borders are all guarded
by the military, so you must fly.

79
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,313
But as I am sure you are aware,

80
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,836
the only private planes
currently allowed into the air

81
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,435
are either UN aid
or the Catholic missionaries.

82
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,517
And so you have come to me for a favour.

83
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,551
I will buy your heroin.

84
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,029
For fifty.

85
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,393
It is true what they say about you.

86
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,155
- And what is that?
- You have no soul.

87
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,193
No.

88
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,831
Go.

89
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,599
Go.

90
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,877
And tell your friends I let you live,
that Mr Eko let you live.

91
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,910
Just give me a second.

92
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,514
Hi. Claire.

93
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,631
- What happened to the statue?
- Don't play stupid.

94
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,711
What?

95
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,873
What's this?
Because this was in your little statue.

96
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,714
Unless I'm mistaken, I remember
you saying you were a drug addict.

97
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,435
I didn't know.

98
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,478
If it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

99
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,879
Claire?

100
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,231
I'm not using.

101
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,794
Look. Believe me now?

102
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,599
I don't care.

103
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,550
Someone's waiting for you.

104
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,831
- Got it?
- Got it.

105
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,400
Breath halfway out,
and gently squeeze the trigger.

106
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,391
Squeeze.

107
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,756
- Good.
- How'd you learn all this stuff?

108
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,831
My dad used to take me hunting.

109
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,071
- Hunting for what?
- Birds mostly.

110
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,871
Of course, birds don't shoot back.

111
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,354
Yeah.

112
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,150
People are talking, thinking
I'm gonna go running off after Walt.

113
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,913
If people are talking,
I'm not hearing it.

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,037
But if I was,
I'd say it's not a very smart plan.

115
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,031
Yeah, it's not.

116
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,110
Let's try one for real.

117
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,591
Bravo.

118
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,357
Well done with Claire, mate.

119
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,512
You got me in a lot of trouble there,
so thanks for that.

120
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,511
I hope you're happy.

121
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,556
That's right. You don't do happy.

122
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,671
All right. Well, we're here.

123
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,955
I found it right by that tree.

124
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,838
- You found it here?
- Yeah. I found it here.

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,956
You're lying.

126
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,108
I don't even know you.

127
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,749
You asked to see where I found it.
This is where I found it.

128
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,035
We're done. Have a nice hike.

129
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,674
You did not find the statue here.

130
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,354
Take me to the plane.

131
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,638
How did you know about the plane, man?

132
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,831
It's old, you know.

133
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,596
Been out in the jungle for years.

134
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,555
Of course, you would know that.
You know everything.

135
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,596
Why did you lie to the girl?

136
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,389
What?

137
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,916
You told her you did not know
what was inside the statue.

138
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,312
- I wasn't lying.
- Then what is the wrong idea?

139
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,389
What?

140
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,711
When I showed you
the broken pieces of plaster,

141
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,430
you said you did not want her
to get the wrong idea.

142
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,431
What is the wrong idea?

143
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,077
I don't have to tell you anything.

144
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,039
You come traipsing across the island
and suddenly now you're in charge?

145
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,997
You want me to take you to your plane?

146
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,991
Start treating me with respect.

147
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,036
I'm not just some guy you can just tr...

148
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,229
What?

149
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,874
What?

150
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,389
Let's go.

151
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,751
Yes, sir.

152
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,877
Sir, if you buy a statue,

153
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,350
the money will buy polio vaccine
for the village.

154
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,510
300 naira, sir.

155
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,477
What are you doing here?

156
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,474
I have come to give my confession.

157
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,790
Hello, Eko.

158
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,950
Hello, Brother.

159
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
I visit you
for the first time in three years

160
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,037
and you won't hear my confession?

161
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,954
Monsignor would have said he'd failed
to raise a proper Catholic boy.

162
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,191
Why waste your time confessing?
It won't help you.

163
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,599
- It won't?
- No.

164
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,753
For confession to mean something,
you must have a penitent heart.

165
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,354
You and your guilt, Yemi.

166
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,592
I've only done what I needed to do
to survive. How is that a sin?

167
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,557
You may live far from here,

168
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,189
but I have heard of who you are
and what you have done.

169
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,032
Have you forgotten how you got
that cross, the day they took me?

170
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,714
Is what I did that day a sin?

171
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,839
Or is it forgiven,
because it is you that was saved?

172
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,269
Why are you here, Eko?

173
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,271
I've come to help you.

174
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,990
I have some merchandise
that I need to get out of the country.

175
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,390
I would like one of your church
relief flights to transport it.

176
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,517
Merchandise. You mean drugs.

177
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,388
It is not my normal business.

178
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,550
We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria

179
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,712
so that they cannot be used
by our people.

180
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,316
And you will have all the money
to buy your vaccine.

181
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,316
God has given us this opportunity.
We should not turn our back on it.

182
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,960
God did not bring you here, Eko.

183
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,951
Your own greed did.

184
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,111
I will always love you,

185
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,835
but I will not help you.

186
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,632
It was good to see you again, Brother.

187
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,357
Little close to the ear.
Sure you know what you're doing?

188
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,079
Would you please turn your head?

189
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
You ain't got a clean enough shot
at my neck?

190
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,191
I can cut my own damn hair.

191
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,989
You don't have to be belligerent
just for belligerence's sake.

192
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,911
Everyone loves you now.

193
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,273
- Bull pucky.
- Yo, Sawyer.

194
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,071
Glad you're back, man.

195
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,398
Yo yourself, Pillsbury.

196
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,754
You see?

197
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,958
Kate, Locke said
you're on hatch duty later.

198
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,874
I was wondering...
You mind if I go instead?

199
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,430
- You want my shift?
- Help me take my mind off things.

200
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,789
- Sure, it's all yours.
- Thanks. Appreciate it.

201
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,109
Glad you're OK, man.

202
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,349
Yeah.

203
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,191
Don't even say it.

204
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,990
All right. Time to take a break.

205
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,991
Just had a break.

206
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,993
I'm not what you think I am.

207
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,878
What do I think you are?

208
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,712
- It was my brother's fault.
- Sorry?

209
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,439
It was his fault I became an addict.

210
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,398
He started with the heroin.
I tried to make him stop.

211
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,958
You don't know me, man.
I was a good person.

212
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,873
I was an altar boy.

213
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,429
I knew what was in that statue.
It doesn't mean I needed it.

214
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,910
So don't judge me, man. Don't... Just...

215
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,831
What?

216
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,511
What's that?

217
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,751
It's a parachute.

218
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,635
Is that a priest?

219
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,110
What're you doing?

220
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,670
Do you know that guy?

221
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,275
Yes.

222
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,555
This man saved my life.

223
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,393
Saved your life, huh?
Sure, that makes sense.

224
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,951
He takes off in a plane in Nigeria.
We're in the South Pacific.

225
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,235
That makes all the sense
in the world.

226
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,189
This is scripture written here.

227
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,631
You're a priest, right?

228
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,996
He's a priest
and you're a priest, too, right?

229
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,031
I need to talk to you.

230
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,669
- I'm in the middle of a confession.
- It cannot wait.

231
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,795
God bless you.

232
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,556
God be with you all.
Please, come back in the morning.

233
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,511
It's OK.

234
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,631
How dare you disrupt my work?

235
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,836
Have you reconsidered my request?

236
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,195
Flying drugs
under the cover of the Church?

237
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,477
How could I ever reconsider?
Don't touch those.

238
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,710
I am going to make this easy for you.

239
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,872
You will make us priests
and we will fly the drugs out.

240
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,997
- Make you priests?
- Sign these ordination documents.

241
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,514
I will give you the money
for the vaccines.

242
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,996
Leave this church now. Go. Now.

243
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,558
Yemi, I understand
that you live in a world

244
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,359
where righteousness and evil
seem very far apart,

245
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,635
but that is not the real world.

246
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,157
I am your brother,
I would never do anything to hurt you,

247
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,755
but my friends,
if you do not do what I ask,

248
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,752
they will burn this church
to the ground.

249
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,598
Is that worth less than the price
of your name on a piece of paper?

250
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,110
Think of the lives you will save.

251
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,234
My signature does not make you a priest.

252
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,432
You could never be a priest.

253
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,317
How many of the Virgin Mary statues
do you have left?

254
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,994
- I've 300.
- I will take all of them.

255
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,990
I guess we are both sinners now.

256
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,510
Perhaps we are,

257
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,114
but God will forgive me.

258
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,912
I'm lost.

259
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,639
It was dark. I was following Sayid.

260
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,711
A big bag of rocks fell on my head.

261
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,749
I'm sorry if I'm a bit spotty
with the geography.

262
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,758
- Climb that tree.
- What?

263
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,071
Perhaps you will get your bearings
or see the plane.

264
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,870
You climb it.

265
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,270
What if I don't? You going to beat me
with your Jesus stick?

266
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,591
I find it odd that your scripture stick
has dried blood on it.

267
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,275
Are you going to climb that tree or not?

268
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,998
What kind of priest are you, anyway?

269
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,709
You need to get higher.

270
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,593
Wonderful. Thank you.

271
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,315
Run.

272
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,354
- Did you see it?
- What the bloody hell did you do?

273
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,555
I did nothing.

274
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,349
When most people see a creature
made of swirling black smoke, they run.

275
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,079
- I was not afraid of it.
- That thing kills people.

276
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,835
- Did you see the plane?
- It's about a kilometre that way.

277
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,831
Thank you.

278
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,039
Wait.

279
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,478
Come on.

280
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,039
Come on.

281
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,791
Where are you?

282
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,435
Hey, Michael.

283
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,794
- Hey.
- How you doing?

284
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,189
I'm good, thanks.

285
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,515
You down here alone?

286
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,751
Yeah. Hurley's supposed to be here.

287
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,229
But I guess he's running late.

288
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,951
Listen...

289
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,154
No one's forgotten about Walt.

290
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,876
- What?
- I can't...

291
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,316
I don't have any idea
what you must be going through.

292
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,868
I just want you to know
that as soon as we can,

293
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,272
we're gonna figure out a way
to go out and bring him back.

294
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,755
Yeah.

295
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,509
Thanks, man. Thanks.

296
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,637
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

297
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,071
I'll leave you to it, then.

298
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,431
Thanks.

299
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,479
Eko.

300
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,349
- What are you doing here?
- I came to stop you.

301
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,874
- Go to your church.
- Do not get on that plane.

302
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,633
- I'm here to save your life.
- Save my life?

303
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,598
- If you get on, if you do this...
- If I do what?

304
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,275
- Are you a prophet now?
- Please, let me take your confession.

305
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,148
Anything I can do, I will do.
But please, don't go.

306
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,836
He told the military.

307
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,559
- You did this?
- I did not tell them who was involved.

308
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,598
Just leave the drugs
and come back with me.

309
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,029
Stop. No more.

310
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,314
Yemi.

311
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,148
No.

312
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,271
Help me get him in.

313
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,911
Forgive me.

314
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,511
Father?

315
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,910
Are you OK, Father?

316
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,315
Eko?

317
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,792
Who's that?

318
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,276
He's my brother.

319
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,951
I'm sorry.

320
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,071
For the one I broke.

321
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,517
So, are you a priest or aren't you?

322
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,991
Yes.

323
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,591
I am.

324
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,909
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

325
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,234
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

326
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,153
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

327
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,275
He restoreth my soul.

328
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,635
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

329
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,952
Yea, though I walk through
the shadow of the valley of death,

330
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,635
I fear no evil, for thou art with me.

331
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,272
Thy rod, thy staff, they comfort me.

332
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,149
Thou preparest a table before me

333
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,596
in the presence of mine enemies,

334
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,356
thou annointest my head with oil,

335
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,512
my cup runneth over.

336
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,069
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me,

337
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,958
all the days of my life,

338
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:42,797
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

339
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,433
Amen.

340
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,795
Claire?

341
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,230
You lied to me, Charlie.

342
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,150
I know I did. I'm sorry.

343
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,431
It just made me feel safer
to have it around.

344
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,159
- I can't have you around my baby.
- Claire, I...

345
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,834
I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us.

346
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,717
Just go.
