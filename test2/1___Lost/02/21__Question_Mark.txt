00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,730
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,133
[rumbling, thud]

3
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:07,598
[screams]

4
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,371
I need you to go up through the grate
and into the vents.

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,309
That button has to be pushed.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,813
OK.

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,384
[Henry] I crawled through your vents
and I stood at your computer.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,120
And you know what happened?

9
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,857
Nothing happened, John.
I never entered the numbers.

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,661
I never pressed the button.

11
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,862
If you want to do
something nice for Libby,

12
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,169
there's a beautiful beach
three kilometers from here.

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:43,675
You could take her there.

14
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,768
Come on, give me the blankets.

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:50,339
- Blankets?
- I will handle the blankets, OK?

16
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,385
Take us to the guns. Now.

17
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:56,786
Oh, that bitch.
She stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

18
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,315
Why would she need a gun?

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,988
We caught one of them. The Others.
He's locked up in there.

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,430
Give me the gun. I'll kill him.

21
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,228
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,730
Michael?

23
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,918
[Ana Lucia] What are you building?

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,631
- Hello, Ana.
- Well, hello, yourself.

25
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,968
So you gonna tell me? What is it?

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,372
I'm building a church.

27
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,275
Now, why the hell
would you wanna do that?

28
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,372
- Because I was told to.
- Told to by who?

29
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,647
I was just told.
I think it was in a dream.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,984
A dream like this one?

31
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,424
You need to help John.

32
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,578
Yemi?

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,991
Hello, brother.

34
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:46,930
Yemi. Forgive me. I should have
listened to you. You were right.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,161
- I didn't mean to do what I did.
- Shh.

36
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,170
The work being done
in this place is important, Eko.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,870
It is more important than anything,
and it is in danger.

38
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,411
You must help John.

39
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,713
He has lost his way.

40
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:09,551
You must make him take you
to the question mark.

41
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,613
[beeping, whirring]

42
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,498
John will not want to show you,
so you must make him.

43
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:32,707
Eko. There are many distractions,
brother, but you must move past them.

44
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,408
What is done is done. Do you understand?

45
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:40,051
Yes, Yemi.

46
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,780
And, Eko? Bring the ax.

47
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,258
What's the matter?

48
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,370
You all right, mate?

49
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,387
I need to find John.

50
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,054
- [Jack] What were you thinking, John?
- [Kate] Leave him alone.

51
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,995
- No, don't.
- [Jack] Shut it, Sawyer.

52
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,329
- If Ana hadn't lifted your gun...
- Swell.

53
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:32,132
Gimpy McCrutch covers up that
the Artist Formerly Known As Henry Gale

54
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:36,471
tried to strangle your little amiga
and it's on me when she goes vigilante.

55
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,841
- How about you go back to the beach?
- Hey, enough. Both of you.

56
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,041
[metallic creak, Michael groans]

57
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,749
Michael. Hey.

58
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,784
- He shot me.
- Who?

59
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:51,722
- He's gone. He ran out.
- Go. I got him.

60
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:56,794
[pants] I was sleeping
and I heard gunshots. I got up.

61
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,492
I came out of the bedroom
and there was this guy.

62
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,591
He had a gun and...

63
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,001
[gasps, splutters]

64
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,835
All right, come on.
We gotta get you up, all right?

65
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,637
[Eko] Let me help you.

66
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,529
[Michael moans]

67
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,007
She's dead.

68
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,155
[she coughs, Sawyer groans]

69
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,162
[Libby splutters]

70
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:12,168
[Jack] Kate, we gotta get her up. We
gotta get her up to the back room, OK?

71
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,837
Grant us this mercy, O Lord,
we beseech thee.

72
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,905
Amen.

73
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,984
[pants, wheezes]

74
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,897
She's in shock. All right,
we gotta keep pressure on this one.

75
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,469
Can you do anything? Jack?

76
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:23,566
I heard you.
Just keep pressure on her, OK?

77
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,572
[whimpers]

78
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,209
How is she?

79
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,446
I'm doing what I can.

80
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,284
- How long ago?
- What?

81
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,984
When did this happen?
How long ago did he leave?

82
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:44,120
I don't know.
Twenty minutes, maybe a half-hour ago.

83
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,998
We can pick up the trail,
catch up to him.

84
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,562
- Man's got a head start, a gun...
- He shot three people. One's dead.

85
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,633
Who's gonna take care of Libby while
you're off playing Daniel Boone?

86
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,807
I will go.

87
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,083
John, you have tracking experience, yes?

88
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

89
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,252
We will find his trail together.

90
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,724
You find anything,
you come right back here

91
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:18,389
and we figure out
what we're gonna do next together.

92
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,700
Let's go, John.

93
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,340
How long has it been
since your last confession?

94
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,678
[man] Good question. Too many years
for me to even remember.

95
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,218
What do you wish
to ask God's forgiveness for?

96
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,914
- What sins have you committed?
- Well, let's see.

97
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,550
Well, I slept with another woman
besides my wife.

98
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,823
- Just once or many times?
- How many is "many"?

99
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,560
To receive God's forgiveness
you must be penitent for your sins.

100
00:08:55,635 --> 00:09:00,698
I also forged lD papers
for a guy pretending to be a priest.

101
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,209
Do you have it?

102
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,883
So what did you do, Padre?
Skim from the collection plate?

103
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,359
You know, I've got some friends in Los
Angeles. I could get you on with them.

104
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,591
- Doing what?
- You know, stuff.

105
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,501
- Morning, Father Tunde.
- Good morning, Monsignor.

106
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:36,235
Mr. Caldwell has been helping me
arrange my trip to the United States.

107
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,539
I'm sorry, Father,
but I've got some bad news.

108
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,171
You're gonna have to
postpone your trip.

109
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,045
It appears we have a miracle.

110
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,446
My daughter, she... she drowned.

111
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,820
I'm very sorry for your loss.

112
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,622
Oh, no, you don't understand.
She came back to life.

113
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,796
We were out in the backblocks
and Charlotte must have slipped

114
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:06,236
and she went into the river
and she's not much of a swimmer.

115
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:10,833
She was dead,
and the next day she woke up.

116
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,869
Don't you understand? It's a miracle.

117
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,213
A confirmation of faith.
Everyone needs to know about this.

118
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,085
- Where is your daughter now?
- At home with my husband.

119
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,680
And what does he think?

120
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:28,750
The world needs to know.
We need to tell the Vatican.

121
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,264
I'm sorry.
We can't just do that, Mrs. Malkin.

122
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:37,166
The church needs to conduct an
investigation before anyone can be told.

123
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,263
Father Tunde will start this process,
if you'll permit him.

124
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,739
[sighs]

125
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,778
Mrs. Malkin, would you
excuse us for a moment?

126
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,837
Of course.

127
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:57,815
Monsignor, with all due respect,
I cannot do what you have asked.

128
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,323
Why not?

129
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,225
Because I do not believe
what this woman says.

130
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,298
Why do you think I chose you?

131
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,070
Are you seeing something I'm not?

132
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,139
Hey.

133
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:34,049
I haven't seen a single track or
piece of sign since we left the hatch.

134
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,653
- What the hell are you following?
- Where is the question mark?

135
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,823
The what?

136
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,260
The question mark, John. Where is it?

137
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,967
You know what?
You keep chasing after your own shadow.

138
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,946
I'm going back.

139
00:11:57,016 --> 00:12:00,543
I know you do not want to show me,
but you must.

140
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,680
- No, I don't have to show you anything.
- Then I'm sorry.

141
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,437
You hit me.

142
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,943
- Why did you...?
- Because you were being difficult.

143
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,250
Are you insane?

144
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,315
No.

145
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,984
[sighs]

146
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,995
Ana Lucia, your friend,
was just murdered and you...

147
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,559
Ana wants me to help you, John.

148
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,939
- Help me do what?
- Find the question mark.

149
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,143
You don't know
what you're talking about.

150
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,205
No.

151
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:14,517
But you know what I am talking about,
John, and that is all that matters.

152
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,051
Here. Here. You wanna find
your damn question mark?

153
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,724
Here, this is it right here.
Here, take it.

154
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,329
Because it's nothing. It's a memory.
It's ten seconds of nothing.

155
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,272
- This is your hatch, yes?
- It's not my hatch.

156
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:36,679
If the swan is where we came from,
then we go that way.

157
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,740
We shouldn't even be out here.

158
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,482
Ana Lucia would still be alive

159
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,389
if I'd just told Jack
that Henry attacked her.

160
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:51,327
Now she wants us to go here, John.
She wants us to go here, John. Together.

161
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:57,498
- She said this in my dream.
- Oh, of course, your dream.

162
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,873
Tell me, John,
haven't you ever followed a dream?

163
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,505
So, the Vatican's really interested
in this one, eh?

164
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,450
That depends
upon what I put in my report.

165
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,252
Why don't you just start
by telling me what happened that night?

166
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,521
Well, I got a call.
That was around 1 a.m.

167
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:26,122
Ambos brought this girl in dead.
She'd been in the water two hours.

168
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,666
Have you had experience
in this type of death?

169
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,396
Yeah, of course. I'm an undertaker.

170
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,807
Well, I mean, it's my day job.
I'm perfectly qualified to be a coroner.

171
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,039
I mean, I did go to medical school.

172
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:46,212
And when did you find out
that she was not dead?

173
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,177
During the autopsy.

174
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,254
During the autopsy?

175
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,317
It's all right.
I didn't expect you to believe me.

176
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,929
I figured you'd want
to have a listen for yourself.

177
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,098
[undertaker] Decedent is a Caucasian
female. 16 1 centimeters, 51. 3 kilos.

178
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,006
Body was prepped and washed
by the very lovely Valerie McTavish.

179
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,408
[Valerie] Ian, stop it.

180
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,040
Commencing with the post.
This is a clear case of drowning.

181
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,017
- I'll begin with the thoracic...
- [girl screams] No!

182
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,077
- Oh, my God. She's alive!
- Val...

183
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,555
[piercing screams]

184
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,615
[overlapping shouts and screams]

185
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,682
[stops]

186
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,627
T ake it.

187
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,725
No, please. I don't want to ever listen
to that tape again.

188
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,183
- You lost already?
- Your map is inexact.

189
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,916
- No kidding?
- These landmarks.

190
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,452
- Is this a river?
- No, it's a wavy line.

191
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,397
I didn't draw it. I just transcribed it.
I don't even know if it is a map.

192
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,593
- Let's assume it is.
- What's the ax for?

193
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,659
I don't know yet.

194
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,230
You were the one
that found this plane, yes?

195
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,295
Yeah.

196
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,331
It was up there.

197
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,938
And what made it fall?

198
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,018
Boone.

199
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,078
Boone made it fall.

200
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,147
Then he died.

201
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,217
A sacrifice that the island demanded.

202
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,322
Excuse me?

203
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,861
Nothing. So, what's next?

204
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,566
We make camp, get some sleep,

205
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,573
and wait for further instruction.

206
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,874
Where in the hell are they?

207
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,044
Just calm down.

208
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,021
Finding his trail in the dark
is not gonna be easy.

209
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,081
They'll be back.

210
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,694
Jack.

211
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,890
She say anything? Libby?

212
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,827
She's still unconscious.

213
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,996
The bleeding's stopped.

214
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,939
- That's good, right?
- No.

215
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,634
It's not good.

216
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,576
- And there's nothing you can...?
- I can make her comfortable.

217
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,281
But I don't have what I need.

218
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,915
Why look at me? I gave you all the meds
two days ago.

219
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,720
The heroin, Sawyer.

220
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:28,906
- Give me twenty minutes.
- Kate's gonna go with you.

221
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,570
- It doesn't take two people to carry...
- Kate is going with you.

222
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,637
Why would he need me to go with him?

223
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:41,277
Jacko here knows his heroin's
in my stash with the guns.

224
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,811
So I can either show you where it's at
or let poor Libby suffer.

225
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:52,957
- That pretty much it, Doc?
- Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

226
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,702
[Sawyer] Let's go, Freckles.

227
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,924
- [Kate] I'm curious about something.
- Yeah, what's that?

228
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,658
How did Ana Lucia get your gun?

229
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,763
I don't know.
She must have lifted it off me.

230
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,170
She pickpocketed your gun?
How'd she do that?

231
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,574
Well, if I knew how she did it, she
wouldn't be able to do it, would she?

232
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,705
After you.

233
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,412
I thought you were taking me
to your stash.

234
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,584
Do you have to make everything
so damn difficult? Just go in.

235
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,211
You kept the guns here.

236
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,207
All this time, right under you.

237
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,615
Fooled you, didn't l?

238
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,491
[Hurley] Hey, guys.

239
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,190
You seen Libby around?

240
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,560
[man] Eko.

241
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,590
- Yemi.
- Shh.

242
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,268
You'll wake John.

243
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,634
Come. Follow me.

244
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,173
Yemi.

245
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,397
[strains]

246
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,304
Yemi.

247
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,938
Yemi.

248
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,316
- Wake up, John.
- [screams]

249
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,551
[thud, John grunts]

250
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,389
Are you all right, John?

251
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,391
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

252
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,790
You had a dream?

253
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,162
Was there a man? A priest?

254
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,173
The man that you saw was my brother.

255
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,337
Your brother?

256
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,578
This is why we needed to come together.

257
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:37,019
This is how we are going to be led,
how we will know where to go.

258
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,853
- I don't know where to go.
- Did he tell you anything?

259
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,655
- No. He...
- Nothing? Anything?

260
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,358
It wasn't even me. It was you.
It didn't...

261
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,029
He... he wanted me to follow him.

262
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,095
Follow him where?

263
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,341
Wait here.

264
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,323
Eko, it was just a dream. It's not safe.

265
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,194
Eko!

266
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,148
Father, I'm afraid it's not
a very good time. Come back later.

267
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,376
Mrs. Malkin,
I must speak to your daughter.

268
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,749
- Yesterday you said...
- I know what I said.

269
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,516
It's just right this minute
it's not a very good time.

270
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,990
All right. Get back in the house, Joyce.
Get her inside.

271
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,789
- Richard, please...
- lnside. Now.

272
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:02,295
I know why you're here, friend,
but save yourself the trouble.

273
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,365
What happened here was not a miracle.

274
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,674
The doctor that treated your daughter
feels differently.

275
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,874
Treated her?
You mean tried to cut her open.

276
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,281
He's just trying to cover up
his own negligence.

277
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:17,583
He tell you the whole story,
how she supposedly drowned?

278
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,523
She fell into a mountain river.
Her body shut down.

279
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,618
She went into hypothermia,
which made her appear dead.

280
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,323
Then why is your wife
so convinced otherwise?

281
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,333
'Cause she's a zealot.

282
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:33,098
All of this, everything she's doing,
it's to spite me.

283
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,904
- Why would she spite you?
- Because she knows I'm a fraud.

284
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,002
Because I make my living as a psychic.

285
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,642
You see, that's what I do. I gather
intelligence on people and I exploit it.

286
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,649
Every day I meet people
looking for a miracle,

287
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,089
desperate to find one.

288
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,925
But there are none to be had.

289
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,363
Not in this world, anyway.

290
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:08,165
I will report back to my monsignor
that there was no miracle here.

291
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,698
Your daughter is alive.
This is all that matters.

292
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,571
Eko. Be careful.

293
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,574
Eko.

294
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,257
Eko.

295
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,694
I'm fine.

296
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,690
Hey, Eko. What's up there?
Do you see anything?

297
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,749
I don't see nothing.

298
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,420
- It's salted.
- What?

299
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,292
The earth has been salted
so that nothing can grow.

300
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,992
Why would anyone wanna salt it?
There's nothing here.

301
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:17,899
I believe they made a circle, a target,

302
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,938
so that this place
can be seen from up above.

303
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,703
They? What place?

304
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,768
The place that this plane fell upon,
John. Come on.

305
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,759
[heavy thud]

306
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,957
John.

307
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,435
Will you help me with this?

308
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,588
Wait.

309
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,840
Eko.

310
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,944
- May l?
- Please. Be my guest.

311
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,024
[clanking]

312
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,307
[Hurley]
We were gonna have our first date.

313
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,713
Date?

314
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,783
Yeah.

315
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,693
Picnic on the beach.

316
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,834
I'm glad you're OK, man.

317
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,740
[both strain and pant]

318
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,459
[splashing]

319
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,575
[electrical hum, static]

320
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,661
[repetitive mechanical whir]

321

[air hisses]

[whooshing]

323
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,500
[printer continues]

324
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,521
John.

325
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,624
[synthesizer intro music]

326
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,240
Hello. I'm Dr. Mark Wickmund,

327
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:40,944
and this is the orientation film
for Station 5 of The Dharma Initiative.

328
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,217
Station 5, or The Pearl,
is a monitoring station

329
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:49,282
where the activities of participants
in Dharma Initiative projects

330
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,387
can be observed and recorded
not only for posterity,

331
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:57,025
but for the ongoing refinement
of the Initiative as a whole.

332
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,569
As Karen DeGroot herself has written,

333
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:04,802
"Careful observation is the only key
to true and complete awareness. "

334
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,674
Your tour of duty in The Pearl
will last three weeks

335
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:13,047
and during this time you will observe
a psychological experiment in progress.

336
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:17,019
Your duty is to observe team members
in another station on the island.

337
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:20,387
These team members are not aware
they are under surveillance

338
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,926
or that they are subjects
of an experiment.

339
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:26,930
Working in eight-hour shifts,
you and your partner will record

340
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:32,061
everything you observe
in the notebooks we 've provided.

341
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,634
What is the nature of the experiment,
you might ask?

342
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,675
What do these subjects
believe they are accomplishing

343
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,177
as they struggle to fulfill their tasks?

344
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,805
You, as the observer,
don't need to know.

345
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,975
All you need to know
is the subjects believe their job

346
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,951
is of the utmost importance.

347
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,251
Remember, everything that occurs,

348
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:57,192
no matter how minute or seemingly
unimportant, must be recorded.

349
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,253
Each time a notebook is filled

350
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:03,425
with the fruits
of your diligent observation,

351
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,494
roll it up, and place it
in one of the containers provided.

352
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,565
Then simply place the container
in the pneumatic tube

353
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,167
and presto,

354
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,812
it will be transported directly to us.

355
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:21,978
At the end of your eight-hour shift,
proceed to the Pala Ferry,

356
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:25,648
which will take you back to
the barracks to prepare for your next...

357
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,658
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,

358
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,093
and all of us here
at The Dharma Initiative, thank you.

359
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:37,261
Namaste and good luck.

360
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,139
[video recorder clicks]

361
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,413
Would you like to watch that again?

362
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,112
No.

363
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,519
No, I've seen enough.

364
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:09,632
What are you doing?

365
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,032
I'm taking this back with us.

366
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,737
Why?

367
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,366
Because they may be important.

368
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,433
Important?

369
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:24,946
I'm sorry. Weren't you just watching
the same thing I was?

370
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:29,146
Yes, John, and I believe
the work you have been doing

371
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,211
is more important now than ever.

372
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,519
What work?

373
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,582
Pushing the button.

374
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:46,900
[laughing ruefully]
That's not work. That's a joke.

375
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:50,566
Rats in a maze with no cheese.

376
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,600
It is work, John. We are being tested.

377
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,970
Tested?

378
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,041
The reason to do it, push the button,

379
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,053
is not because we are told to do so
in a film.

380
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:11,387
Oh, well.
Well, then, what is the reason, Mr. Eko?

381
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:14,454
We do it
because we believe we are meant to.

382
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,199
Isn't that the reason
you pushed it, John?

383
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:26,942
I was never meant to do anything!

384
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:36,952
Every single second
of my pathetic little life

385
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,649
is as useless as that button!

386
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:44,122
You think it's important?
You think it's necessary?

387
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,527
It's nothing. It's nothing.

388
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,930
It's meaningless.

389
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,701
And who are you
to tell me that it's not?

390
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,566
That's flight 81 5 leaving from gate 23.

391
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:05,480
- Thank you.
- [PA] 840 starting to board at gate 16.

392
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,949
[whoosh of jet engines]

393
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,251
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

394
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,292
- Look, your father said...
- I know.

395
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,261
He doesn't want me talking to you,
and I know you probably think I'm crazy,

396
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,299
but I have a message for you
and I promised to deliver it.

397
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,765
A message?

398
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,964
- He says you were a good priest.
- Who says that?

399
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:32,800
Yemi.

400
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:41,414
Speaking about my brother is not a joke,

401
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,010
so you should be very careful
what you say next.

402
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:50,927
I saw him when I was between places.
He said that you would come and see me.

403
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,590
He said even though you were pretending,
you're a good man.

404
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,600
Who put you up to this?
Did your father tell you to do this?

405
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,636
He wants you to know
he will see you soon.

406
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:04,198
He said that even though you don't have
faith in yourself, he has faith in you.

407
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,271
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?

408
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:14,512
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Is everything... all right?

409
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:25,486
He has faith in you.
One day you'll believe me.

410
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,034
[PA] Oceanic Airlines flight 815
is now boarding for Los Angeles.

411
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,028
This cross was worn by my brother Yemi.

412
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:42,804
Yemi was a great man,
a priest, a man of God,

413
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,247
and because I betrayed him,
he was shot and died.

414
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,919
He was placed on a plane

415
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,320
which took off from an airstrip
in Nigeria,

416
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,518
half a world from here.

417
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:03,764
Then the plane that I was on
crashed on this island.

418
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,263
And somehow, here,
I found my brother again.

419
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,867
I found him in the same plane
that took off from Nigeria,

420
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:15,468
in the same plane
that lies above us now

421
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,242
that has concealed this place.

422
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:25,948
And I took this cross from around
Yemi's neck and put it back on mine.

423
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:32,929
Just as it was on the day
I first took another man's life.

424
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,399
So let me ask you,

425
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,274
how can you say this is meaningless?

426
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:56,310
I believe the work being done in the
hatch is more important than anything.

427
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,025
If you will not continue
to push the button, John,...

428
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,689
I will.

429
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,522
Can...

430
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,362
Can I talk to her?

431
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,362
Sure.

432
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,986
Hey.

433
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:18,367
[sniffs] It's Hurley.

434
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,362
Hugo.

435
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,349
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.

436
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,989
I'm sorry I forgot the blankets.

437

- [strained] Michael.
- Michael.

440
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:14,046
He's OK. He made it, Libby.
It's OK. It's all right.

441
