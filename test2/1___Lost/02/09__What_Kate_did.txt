1
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,916
Sorry, man. I know this hurts.

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,509
Michael told me you pulled
the bullet out with your bare hands.

3
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,558
You'll have to show me
how to do that sometime.

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,511
Where is she?

5
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,196
- What? I didn't...
- Where is she?

6
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,997
You mean Kate? She's been watching
over you for the past 24 hours straight.

7
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,516
Only way I could get rid of her
was to send her to get food for you.

8
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,711
I love her.

9
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,238
Hey, girl. What are you doing here?

10
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,872
- Hey, there.
- All right. Let's get you to bed.

11
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,556
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

12
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,030
What the hell is that smell?

13
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,475
- Probably your breath.
- Yeah, right.

14
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,755
- Come on.
- Wow.

15
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,831
You're beautiful.

16
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,558
Hey.

17
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,559
Hey. I just gave you a compliment.

18
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,231
Yeah. I heard you.

19
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,839
Aren't you gonna
take my pants off first?

20
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,110
You are beautiful.

21
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,197
Good night.

22
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,476
Coffee? Pie? Both?

23
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,279
- How about a beer?
- I'd like to see some ID.

24
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,838
I'm 24, Ma.

25
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,992
You wanna ride on that death trap
of yours without a helmet,

26
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,992
I'm not gonna help your cause
by getting you drunk.

27
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,511
- How's that wrist?
- What? This?

28
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,392
You know that shelf in the kitchen
sticks out sometimes.

29
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,040
- You'd think I'd remember it was there.
- Don't.

30
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,230
I made my bed, Katherine.

31
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,076
Well, your bed's gone, Ma.

32
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,392
What?

33
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,517
What is this?

34
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
- An insurance policy for the house.
- I never...

35
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,674
I took it out in your name.

36
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,276
What did you do?

37
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,635
Does Wayne know about this?

38
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,154
Just remember you were here
and you didn't see me.

39
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,674
Katherine! What did you do?

40
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,431
I took care of you, Ma.

41
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,197
I gotta go.
You're not gonna see me for a while.

44
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,791
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,112
You OK?

46
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,318
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm just...
I think I'm tired.

47
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,395
- How is he?
- Fever's still up there.

48
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,033
Can't tell if the antibiotics
are working.

49
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,031
It'll help to get some food in him.

50
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,795
You should get down to the beach
for Shannon.

51
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,196
I was actually thinking
that I should stay and watch Sawyer.

52
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,991
I'll stay with him.

53
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,514
You should be there.

54
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,913
Keep him hydrated. Maybe mash up some
fruit and see if you can get him to eat.

55
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,629
Everybody will be at the beach,
so don't forget the button.

56
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,119
I've got it.

57
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,873
- I'll be back in a couple hours.
- Yep.

58
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,956
You're sure you're OK?

59
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,591
Yeah. I'm great.

60
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,919
Hey.

61
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,635
I'm going to go to the funeral.

62
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,396
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

63
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,357
I think most of them realise
it was an accident, Ana.

64
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,950
Shannon and I were strangers.

65
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,990
We never would have met if...

66
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,189
We wouldn't even have spoken if...

67
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,951
But we did meet.

68
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,116
And we did speak.

69
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,191
At least.

70
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,196
I loved her.

71
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,270
May she rest in peace.

72
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,357
You hungry?

73
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,034
I'm just gonna mash you up
some fruit here.

74
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,153
When you wake up, you're gonna get a
kick out of me feeding you like a baby.

75
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,916
I saw a horse.

76
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,519
Yeah.

77
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,319
That's what happens
when you don't sleep.

78
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,554
Sawyer? You awake?

79
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,593
You killed me.

80
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,109
Why did you kill me?

81
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,631
It's the alarm.

82
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,518
Kate!

83
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,669
Kate!

84
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,192
Sawyer!

85
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,950
4, 8...

86
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,156
15, 16, 2...

87
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,279
42.

88
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,153
- What happened?
- I don't know.

89
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,356
- Well, you said...
- I don't know, John!

90
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,992
Well, where's Kate?

91
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,991
Kate. Hey.

92
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,590
- You missed the funeral.
- Yeah, I was with Sawyer.

93
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,318
Oh, right.

94
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,119
A few of "them" came. The new people.

95
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,195
Not her, the one who killed Shannon.
That would've been a bit awkward.

96
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,589
They seem to have had
a rough time of it.

97
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,917
Looks like they went bloody
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> out there.

98
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,549
You haven't listened to a word
I've said.

99
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,952
- Do you think there are horses here?
- What?

100
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,671
I think I saw a horse in the jungle.

101
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,550
I've seen polar bears.

102
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,518
I've seen monsters.
Well, heard monsters.

103
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,478
But horses? No.

104
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,794
Kate, where are you going?

105
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,156
Tallahassee, one way, please.

106
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,032
Tallahassee? I spent a week
in Tallahassee one night.

107
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,877
It's all strip malls and waffle houses.

108
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,077
What's a pretty girl like you
gonna do down in Tallahassee?

109
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,755
- I'm sure I'll find something.
- Bet you've got family down there.

110
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,876
Actually, I'm just visiting.

111
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,634
Hey.

112
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,277
Hey.

113
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,436
Don't I know you?

114
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,156
No, I don't think so.

115
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,917
Don't run, Kate.

116
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,078
I got her.

117
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,594
Kate Austen,
you're under arrest for murder.

118
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,750
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

119
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,035
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

120
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,829
Charlie. Have you seen Kate?

121
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,431
A little while ago in the jungle.

122
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,478
She was acting kind of barmy,
asking me about horses.

123
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,710
You know where she is now?

124
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,473
She's on the path
heading back to the caves.

125
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,837
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, Charlie. Everything's fine.

126
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,351
- Thank you.
- Free at last, huh?

127
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,868
Yeah, man. Looks good.

128
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,551
Hey, Locke,
what's up with the blast doors?

129
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,518
Blast doors?

130
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,433
Yeah. Like, in case of an explosion,
they come from the ceiling.

131
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,080
- That guy down here...
- Desmond?

132
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,312
- He didn't tell you what they were for?
- No. No, he didn't.

133
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,109
But he did leave a movie.

134
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,589
- A movie?
- Yeah.

135
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,994
You wanna see it?

136
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,877
I would like to see it, too.

137
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,431
If you don't mind.

138
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,114
Why not? The more, the merrier.

139
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,957
Kate,
what the hell are you doing out here?

140
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,638
What happened in the hatch, Kate?
Why did you leave?

141
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,393
I find Sawyer on the ground.
You just took off...

142
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,313
- Is he OK?
- Yes, Kate, he's fine.

143
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,913
- I'm sorry.
- Are you?

144
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,757
Yeah, I'm sorry.

145
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,832
I'm sorry that I am not
as perfect as you.

146
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,150
I'm sorry that I'm not as good!

147
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,274
- What's going on with you?
- Just forget it.

148
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,396
- Don't walk away from me.
- Let go of me.

149
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,198
- No. Kate.
- Don't!

150
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,830
It's OK. It's OK.

151
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,914
Hey.

152
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,037
Jack. This place is crazy. It's just...

153
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,873
I can't... It's driving me nuts.

154
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,951
I know. It's OK.

155
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,032
It's all right. It's all right.

156
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,552
All right?

157
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,793
Kate!

158
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,430
<i>From the moment the alarm sounds,</i>

159
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,514
<i>you will have four minutes to enter the</i>
<i>code into the microcomputer processor...</i>

160
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,477
<i>... induction into the program.</i>

161
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,315
<i>When the alarm sounds, either you</i>
<i>or your partner must input the code.</i>

162
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,193
<i>It is highly recommended that you and</i>
<i>your partner take alternating shifts.</i>

163
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,158
<i>In this manner,</i>

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,755

168
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,430

169
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,512

170
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,068
<i>and all of us at the Dharma Initiative,</i>

171
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,154

172
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,632
All right.

173
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,316
So, you've been pushing that button
every two hours since you got down here?

174
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,992
That's right.

175
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,597
How's that even work?

176
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,639
I've set up two-person shifts.
Six hours. Everyone's on the roster.

177
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,757
Don't they wanna know why?

178
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,229
I think the film's
pretty self-explanatory.

179
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,075
Really? All I heard was something
about electromagnets and an "incident".

180
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,310
What about all the missing pieces?

181
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,118
You mean the splices?

182
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,158
Just a frame here and there, I think.
Nothing important.

183
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,231
What do you think?

184
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,396
About the film? What do you think?

185
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,429
I'm sorry I missed it. Her funeral.

186
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,829
I had to be with Sawyer, so...

187
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,153
Why aren't you with him now?

188
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,550
Because I'm going crazy.

189
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,150
Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?

190
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,914
I saw Walt in the jungle,
just before Shannon was shot.

191
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,949
Does that make me crazy?

192
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,030
It's a long drive back
to the arraignment. You comfy?

193
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,191
Why now?

194
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,956
- What?
- Nice, corn-fed farm girl like you.

195
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,319
No history of violence. Straight A's.
No record, couple of speeding tickets.

196
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,908
I just gotta wonder,
why did you kill him now?

197
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,549
Right, yeah, don't tell me. You wouldn't
wanna incriminate yourself.

198
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,029
Not after you were so smart planning it.

199
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,838
That jury back in lowa sure ain't
gonna get hung up on premeditation.

200
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,956
And a gas leak?

201
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,999
Come on. That's amateur hour
from top to bottom.

202
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,355
Sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

203
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,876
- I have you all figured out.
- You don't know anything about me.

204
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,839
White-trash mom divorces dad, starts up
with some guy who's a drinker.

205
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,196
Maybe he knocks her around a little bit,
so she marries him,

206
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
because, you know, that's what happens.

207
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,752
Then this drunk, this Wayne,
he moves into your house.

208
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,310
And you get to lay there every night
and listen to him doing your mom

209
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,709
right there in your daddy's old bedroom.

210
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,315
And even that wouldn't be so bad
if he didn't beat her up all the time.

211
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,278
But she loves him.

212
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,112
She defends him.

213
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,239
If that don't make a person want to kill
somebody, I don't know what does.

214
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,834
But the question is: now, why now?

215
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,471
Why after all these years did you
just decide to blow poor Wayne up?

216
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,674
He come knocking on your door
late at night?

217
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,515
He never touched me.

218
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,033
Look out!

219
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,475
Why can't you
just put the numbers in now?

220
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,870
No. Doesn't work that way.
The alarm goes off at four minutes.

221
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,951
You can't type anything until then.

222
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,149
You mind if I check out
some of this hardware?

223
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,919
Sure.

224
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,671
Just don't break it.

225
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,954
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

226
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,429
I have something I think you should see.

227
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,917
If you don't mind,
I will begin at the beginning.

228
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,919
Long before Christ, the King of Judah
was a man named Josiah.

229
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,797
Boy, when you say "beginning",
you mean "beginning".

230
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,869
At that time, the temple where
the people worshipped was in ruin.

231
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,434
And so the people worshipped idols.

232
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,799
False gods.
And so, the kingdom was in disarray.

233
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,668
Josiah, since he was a good king,

234
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,995
sent his secretary to the treasury
and said "We must rebuild the temple".

235
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,556
"Give all of the gold to the workers
so that this will be done."

236
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,310
But when the secretary returned,
he had no gold.

237
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,515
And when Josiah asked why this was,

238
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,110
the secretary replied...

239
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,998
"We found a book".

240
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,715
- Do you know this story?
- No. Afraid I don't.

241
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,875
What the secretary had found
was an ancient book.

242
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,910
The Book of Law.

243
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,989
You may know it as the Old Testament.

244
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,792
And it was with that ancient book,

245
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,791
not with the gold,

246
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,189
that Josiah rebuilt the temple.

247
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,710
On the other side of the island...

248
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,829
we found a place much like this.

249
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,509
And in this place we found a book.

250
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,358
I believe what's inside there
will be of great value to you.

251
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,519
Hey.

252
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,914
So, Rose's husband's white.

253
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,394
- Didn't see that one coming.
- Is there something you need, Hurley?

254
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,313
Nope. Just taking a walk.

255
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,913
Thought I'd say hey.

256
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,070
Who's taking care of Sawyer?

257
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,479
Sun is.

258
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,790
So you're, like, mad at him?

259
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,157
Why would I be mad at Sawyer?

260
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,073
Maybe because he's the one
who always comes down here

261
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,276
and chops wood and now you are.

262
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,555
It's, like, transference.

263
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,914
Are you a shrink now?

264
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,878
That's what they called it
in the mental hospital.

265
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,111
I'm not mad at anyone.

266
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,590
Where's Jack?

267
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,955
I don't know. He didn't come back.

268
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,196
Has he said anything?

269
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,719
Sawyer?

270
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,354
No. He's still sleeping.

271
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,835
Can you watch him?

272
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,676
- I can stay if you...
- No, yeah, I can.

273
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,239
Thanks.

274
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,268
Right.

275
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,559
Yes,
I'm sure that's the exact form you got.

276
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,988
I'll send one over to you, right.

277
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,997
I'll call you back later.

278
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,878
Hi, Dad.

279
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,153
The police and the US Marshals
are looking for you.

280
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,152
- You shouldn't have come.
- I was outside for two hours.

281
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,310
They're not here.

282
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,190
Is it true? What they're saying?

283
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,797
Katie, what did you come here for?

284
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,111
Why didn't you tell me, Dad?

285
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,838
Tell you what?

286
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,195
I was making a scrapbook.
A surprise for your birthday.

287
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,470
So I called one of your COs
to get some pictures of you in uniform.

288
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,994
The pictures he sent me
had dates on the back.

289
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,834
Photos of you in Korea, up until
four months before I was born.

290
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,993
Why didn't you tell me
that Wayne was my father?

291
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,438
Why?

292
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,108
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd kill him.

293
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,919
And your mother loved him.

294
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,751
You were five years old.
I wanted to take you along with me

295
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,831
but she wouldn't let me.

296
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,797
So why didn't you kill him?

297
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,354
Because I don't have murder in my heart.

298
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,069
I'm gonna have to call them.

299
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,036
Can I have an hour?

300
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,038
Bye, Daddy.

301
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,551
Can you hear me?

302
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,273
Sawyer?

303
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,871
Wayne?

304
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,790
I'm probably crazy...

305
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,630
and this doesn't matter...

306
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,517
but maybe you're in there, somehow.

307
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,470
And you asked me a question.

308
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,191
You asked me why I...

309
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,191
Why I did it.

310
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,594
It wasn't because
you drove my father away.

311
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,790
Or the way you looked at me.

312
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,795
Or because you beat her.

313
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,598
It was because I hated
that you were part of me.

314
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,672
That I would never be good.

315
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,955
That I would never have anything good.

316
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,035
And every time that I look at Sawyer,

317
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,315
every time I feel something for him,

318
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,071
I see you, Wayne.

319
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,950
And it makes me sick.

320
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,873
That's about the sweetest thing
I ever heard.

321
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,192
Sawyer?

322
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,835
Who the hell is Wayne?

323
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,077
Am I in a bunk bed?

324
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,310
Yeah, you're in a bunk bed.

325
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,871
Are we saved?

326
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,556
No, Sawyer.

327
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,278
Not yet.

328
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,119
<i>Voila.</i>

329
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,068
What are the odds?

330
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,116
- The odds?
- Yeah.

331
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,992
Here, hold this down on the table there,
nice and flat.

332
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,758
I mean, think about it.
Somebody made this film.

333
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,112
Someone else cut this piece out.

334
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,517
We crash, two halves of the same plane
fall on different parts of the island.

335
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,875
You're over there. I'm over here.

336
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,875
And now here's the missing piece,
right back where it belongs.

337
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,196
What are the odds?

338
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,832
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

339
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,149
You've gotta be kidding me.

340
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,435
Airlock's over this way.

341
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,191
Come on, admit it. We've been rescued.

342
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,391
You got it? Sorry.

343
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,191
Watch yourself.

344
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,751
Son of a bitch.

345
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,157
Watch yourself, OK?

346
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,917
- I got it.
- OK.

347
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,356
Home, sweet home.

348
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,873
Yeah.

349
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,829
I really thought
you were yanking my chain.

350
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,716
What do you keep smiling at?

351
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,075
You need a haircut.

352
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,240
Oh, really?

353
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,592
Oh, really?

354
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,629
Maybe you ought to take me back inside.

355
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,031
You see that?

356
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,312
You mean the big-ass horse standing
in the middle of the jungle? Then, yeah.

357
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,756
You know that horse, freckles?

358
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,431
Yeah, I do.

359
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,277
Tequila and tonic.
That's your drink, right?

360
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,475
- Where's the tonic?
- We're running a little low on mixers.

361
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,836
Sure you wanna waste that on me?

362
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,796
I figured you could use a drink.

363
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,751
I know I could.

364
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,915
You gonna try to convince me that
everyone here doesn't hate me?

365
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,992
Only if you're gonna try to convince me
every woman in the world's not crazy.

366
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,514
<i>When the alarm sounds, either you</i>
<i>or your partner must input the code.</i>

367
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,592
