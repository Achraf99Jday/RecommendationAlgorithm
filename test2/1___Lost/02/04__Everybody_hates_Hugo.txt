1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,429
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,750
Locke, do you have a message
to go on the raft?

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,832
For when they get rescued.
They can contact your family.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,674
- Michael!
- Jin!

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,876
We were on a plane.
Sydney to Los Angeles.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,757
- Flight 815?
- Right.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,272
Back up!

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,710
Coming out.

9
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,352
Hi, there, Hurley!

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,198
- Jin, you're here.
- I sure am.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,239
- Dude, you speak English.
- No. You're speaking Korean.

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,355
Everything's going to change.

13
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,910
Everything's going to change.

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,635
Have a "cluckety-cluck-cluck" day, Hugo.

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,349
Hurley!

16
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,716
- You fell asleep?
- No. I was just... resting my eyes.

17
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,394
- The numbers are written right there.
- Yeah. I remember the numbers.

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,111
Locke went back to the beach,
so I'll be taking the next shift.

19
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,270
Awesome.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,749
Jack told me about your job.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,355
At least we have jobs again, right?

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,468
Hooray for us.

23
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,670
Well, ain't life grand?

24
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,510
What I wouldn't give
for a cup of water right now...

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,116
No way. No more human pyramids.
Just forget it.

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,839
Hey!

27
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,955
Hey! Hey! Let us out of here!

28
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,474
Enough! Just chill!

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,195
Every minute I spend down here

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,919
is another minute
my boy is still out there.

31
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,438
Well, let me break it down for ya,
Mikey.

32
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,990
Rambina and her buddies are trying
to figure out what to do with us,

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,789
so until they make up their damn mind,
there ain't nothing we can do.

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,517
Yeah.

35
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,875
Why don't you pee on it?

36
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,910
Grab the rope.

37
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,392
Please.

38
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,432
Don't do it.

39
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,835
Climb the rope, or I shoot your friend.

40
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,596
You next.

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,314
Don't do it. She's bluffing.

44
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,079
- God!
- Grab the rope.

45
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,559
You want me, Hot Lips? You're gonna
have to come down here and get...

46
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,073
Bitch.

47
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,552
<i>4, 8, 15,</i>

48
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,713
<i>16 and 23,</i>
<i>with the Mega Number 42.</i>

49
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,920
<i>Whoever has those numbers has won</i>
<i>or will share in a near-record jackpot.</i>

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,675
<i>That's right, Mary Jo, because</i>
<i>this is the 16th week without a winner.</i>

51
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,395
Hugo?

52
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,429
Hugo! Oh! Hugo, wake up! Wake up!

53
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,953
Stop!

54
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,349
Ma, stop! I just slipped.

55
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,670
Slipped, sitting down? Is it your heart?

56
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,796
- Ma, I'm fine.
- You're lying.

57
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,075
I always know.
You don't look me in the eye.

58
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,913
- I'm not lying.
- Then tell me what happened.

59
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,756
It must have been something I ate.

60
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,833
Yes, something you ate, because
you eat <i>basura,</i> and you don't exercise.

61
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,593
- I do exercise.
- Falling down is not exercise.

62
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,389
The only time you move
is to lift a drumstick from the bucket.

63
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,711
Every day, it's the same thing:
work, TV, chicken.

64
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,635
You have to change your life, Hugo.

65
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,439
You think someone else
will change it for you?

66
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,398
Maybe if you pray every day
Jesus Christ will come down,

67
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,870
take 200 pounds and bring you
a decent woman. And a new car.

68
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,996
Yes, Jesus can bring you a new car.

69
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,436
Maybe I don't wanna change.
Maybe I like my life.

70
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,157
That must be Jesus.

71
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,389
Yes, it is Jesus! He wants
to know what colour car you want!

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,879
Hurley! All right, mate?
We need to have a little chat.

73
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,077
Mummy's off for a walk,
so it's just you, me, and the baby.

74
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,309
Spill it.

75
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,597
Spill what?

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,190
The hatch. What's in it?

77
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,470
Nothing, really.

78
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,996
You've been out there an entire day
and night. Looking at nothing?

79
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,674
Well, I guess
it's kind of like a bunker.

80
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,513
You know, from World War Two?
Only newer.

81
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,430
And what's in it?

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,192
I don't know.

83
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,430
But somehow you know it's a bunker.

84
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,198
Well, I guess someone told me?

85
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,389
You're gonna lie to me?

86
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,439
- You're gonna lie to the baby?
- Dude, look, I'd never lie.

87
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
And the time you told me
you were worth $150 million?

88
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,149
- It's 156 million.
- I'm sorry!

89
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,789
I must've confused it
with the 900 trillion I am worth myself!

90
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,472
And this baby's made of
chocolate lollipops, so excuse us,

91
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,279
I'm going to flap my wings
and fly off this island.

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,468
- Hey, Rose.
- Hey, yourself.

93
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,796
So, doing laundry, huh?

94
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,348
Indeed I am.

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,432
You wanna hand me
those dirty clothes over there?

96
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,038
Thank you.

97
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,115
Don't you wanna know what happened?

98
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,509
- What happened?
- You know... out there.

99
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,114
Everyone's asking me
what's in the hatch.

100
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,714
Well, that's your business, honey.

101
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,156
- Don't you wanna know?
- Well, whatever it is,

102
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,437
it's not going to help
get this laundry done, now is it?

103
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,915
Well, actually, it sort of is.

104
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,870
It's around here somewhere...

105
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,354
Someone actually lived down here?

106
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,438
Well, what is it for?

107
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,070
It's kind of a long story.

108
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,150
Hurley. Who else did you tell?

109
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,834
No one. I swear.

110
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,149
Dude, it's a big job. I needed...

111
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,995
help.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,913
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Rose.

113
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,551
She's cool. She won't tell anyone.

114
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,079
Honey,
I don't even know what I would say.

115
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,350
All this is food?

116
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,149
It's only a matter of time before we
have to tell everyone what we found.

117
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,276
So, you know what to do?

118
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,114
Inventory all of it,
and figure out how we make it last.

119
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,190
In the meantime,
nobody gets anything.

120
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,317
No exceptions.
That's your responsibility, Hurley. OK?

121
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,395
- What's that?
- You don't wanna know.

122
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,148
"Dharma Initiative salad dressing:
ranch composite."

123
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,151
That sounds tasty.

124
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,955
"Apollo Bars?" You ever hear of these?

125
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,117
But candy is candy.
That's what Bernard always says.

126
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,834
Talk about a sweet tooth.

127
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,559
That man has a mouth
full of sweet teeth.

128
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,153
- Bernard. That was your husband?
- "Is" my husband.

129
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,630
But I thought he was
in the back of the plane?

130
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,230
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- No, that's OK, don't feel bad.

131
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,550
Bernard is fine. I know it.

132
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,200
You wanna get the canned tuna?

133
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,595
Everyone's gonna hate me, Rose.

134
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,033
Now, that's just plain silly.

135
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,715
You're about the only one on this island
that everybody loves.

136
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,951
Well, that'll change.

137
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,190
You happen to find any shampoo in here?

138
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,589
Yeah, there's some right over here.

139
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,150
Kate, you can't take it...

140
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,231
Thanks, Hurley.

141
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,436
- It's just one bottle.
- That's where it starts.

142
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,160
Welcome to Mr Cluck's,
can I take your order?

143
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,479
Hey, Hugo.

144
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,348
- You OK, man?
- Yeah. Fine.

145
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,553
Reyes! My office! Now!

146
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,511
You wanna tell me something, Reyes?

147
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,759
No.

148
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,796
You sure about that?

149
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,512
Yeah.

150
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,989
This is last night's surveillance tape.

151
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,637
Reyes, you owe the company
for an eight-piece dark-meat combo.

152
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,792
- I didn't eat eight.
- You want to watch the whole tape?

153
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,270
Oh, and while you're here:
how many times do I gotta tell you

154
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,352
those napkins cost money, all right?

155
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,558
It's two per customer. Two. We're not
made of money here at Mr Cluck's, Reyes.

156
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,949
I'm not made of money.
Are you made of money?

157
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,077
If you're made of money,
maybe you don't want to work here.

158
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,835
So, get it together.
What, is that a problem, Reyes?

159
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,197
Dude, I quit.

160
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,672
Oh, my God.

161
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,996
- Oh, my God.
- Dude? Are you OK?

162
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,432
- I'm fine.
- Randy is losing his brain in there!

163
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,751
You should get back in
or he'll make you scrub johns all week.

164
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,876
Doubt it. I quit, too.

165
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,758
- What?
- Looks like we got ourselves a day off.

166
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,439
Who needs money
when you got good looks?

167
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,070
You can come out now.

168
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,832
I saw you back at the rock.

169
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,555
Then at the mangrove tree.

170
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,273
In fact, I've walked in a big circle.
I'm not sure how you didn't realise it.

171
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,717
All right, you don't have to insult me.

172
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,237
You wanna tell me
why you've been following me, Charlie?

173
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,673
Yeah.

174
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,355
Quite simply, John,
there are a lot of secrets around here.

175
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,355
And I'm tired of being
at the kids' table.

176
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,510
I got Claire's baby back!

177
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,433
I didn't go to the Black Rock
on the A-Team mission,

178
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,159
but I would have,
if someone had asked me.

179
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,237
I think I'm entitled
to some sodding answers around here.

180
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,710
What do you want to know?

181
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,075
How's it going?

182
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,073
It's not. On the other side of this
door, there's more concrete.

183
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,638
I'd say it's at least
eight-to-ten-feet thick.

184
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,711
Did you see this?

185
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,869
Interesting.
Good thing this is titanium.

186
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,428
Almost no magnetic attraction.

187
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,954
Well, we're not going to get in up here.

188
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,712
Up here?

189
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,311
Perhaps we can go under it.

190
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,672
Grab the rope.

191
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,877
I ain't doing nothing
until I know my friends are OK.

192
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,871
So we're friends now, huh?

193
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,669
Do it now or the rope comes up.

194
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,478
Howdy, boys, thanks for the rescue.

195
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,473
Everything is cool, we had a talk and
they believe we were on the plane, too.

196
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,189
Swell. I guess we can all sue
Oceanic together.

197
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,951
What you got there?

198
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,716
- Nothing.
- A rock? Looking for some revenge?

199
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,189
- You got three seconds to drop it.
- Ana.

200
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,510
One, two...

201
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,158
Now, hold on...

202
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,832
Hey, what's...

203
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,271
You didn't say "three".

204
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,477
Shut up. When I tell you
to do something, you do it.

205
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,632
I say move, you move.
I say stop, you stop.

206
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,109
- I say jump, what do you say?
- "You first."

207
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,430
You don't like the rules, I toss
your ass back in the pit right now.

208
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,795
You understand?

209
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,757
I understand.

210
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,630
It's getting dark. We're moving out.

211
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,354
- Moving out where?
- What did I just tell you?

212
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,998
Sorry. Forgot. Just one thing, though.

213
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,118
You hit me again, I'll kill you.

214
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,638
Let's go.

215
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,118
He pushed that button every 108 minutes?

216
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,789
- He did indeed.
- How is that possible? Didn't he sleep?

217
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,599
Don't know.
I didn't get a chance to ask him.

218
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,517
After all that time, he just
up and left? Why? Where'd he go?

219
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,352
Don't know.

220
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,352
I tried to track him,
but he didn't leave much of a trail.

221
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,749
I guess he'd found his replacements.

222
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,070
- Meaning us?
- Meaning us.

223
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,914
It sounds a bit... nutty, doesn't it?

224
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,951
It is what it is, Charlie.

225
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,750
And what happens if we don't push it?

226
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,638
We're not going to find out.
I'm setting up a system.

227
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,111
I'm still working on it, but looks like
two-person shifts every six hours or so.

228
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,317
Shifts. Pushing a button?

229
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,635
Oh, and there's a record player.

230
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,196
What's Hurley been doing there?

231
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,635
He's in charge of the food.

232
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,359
Food?

233
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,918
Hey, mate.

234
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,113
- Where you been?
- Hey. I've been... around.

235
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,037
I know, Hurley.

236
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,916
- You know what?
- I know about the food.

237
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,275
- Locke told me everything.
- Locke's lying.

238
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,433
About the button we have to push every
108 minutes or the island explodes?

239
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,715
- It's not gonna explode.
- Ah!

240
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,596
- Come on.
- Look, Jack put me in charge.

241
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,592
- I don't even want to...
- Is there peanut butter?

242
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,319
- What?
- Peanut butter. Nutty? Creamy?

243
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,550
Staple of children everywhere?

244
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,995
Yeah, a couple jars.

245
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,514
Brilliant. How about you give us one?

246
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,873
It's for Claire.

247
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,953
- No can do, man.
- You're saying no to a nursing mother?

248
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,076
- It's not like that.
- It's exactly like that.

249
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,630
I never thought this would happen,
but you've become one of them.

250
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,156
- One of them?
- Them. The man. Management.

251
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,197
I thought we were friends.
You've changed, man.

252
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,030
<i>You are everybody</i>

253
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,753
<i>You are everybody</i>

254
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,077
- <i>Acting like you're stupid</i>
- <i>Exactly like you're people</i>

255
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,150
- <i>Wearing your clothes and whatnot...</i>
- <i>Wearing expensive something...</i>

256
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,989
Drive Shaft... More like Suck Shaft.

257
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,155
I'm gonna go check out the headphones.

258
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,590
Sure. Headphones.

259
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,757
- Hugo.
- Starla.

260
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,831
Why aren't you chuckleheads at work?

261
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,559
We're currently exploring
other opportunities.

262
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,596
- You quit?
- I did.

263
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,719
He's mixing it up today. He's off the
rails. Somebody get a straightjacket!

264
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,429
- Hey, can I try those on?
- You're messing with my world-view.

265
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,353
You're my rock.
I mean, if you quit your job,

266
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,399
the next thing you know, bees will stop
making honey, and flowers will die,

267
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,119
and, hell,
the whole damn thing will fall apart.

268
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,312
So, Starla...

269
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,434
Sorry. Uh, well...

270
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,399
The Hold Steady's
playing the Troubadour this weekend.

271
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,917
- And I was wondering, maybe Friday...
- Oh, I have to work.

272
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,390
- Oh, no, I didn't mean...
- I can probably go Saturday. That cool?

273
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,075
Yeah. That's totally cool.

274
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,237
You've been crushing on her
for months and doing nothing.

275
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,438
Today, you're fricking Fabio! Seriously,
man, what has gotten into you?

276
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,239
Nothing. I just wanted
to ask her out before...

277
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,595
- Before what?
- Nothing.

278
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,998
This is the last duct. I believe we're
under the area where we began.

279
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,832
They've poured concrete
all the way down here, too.

280
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,751
Just as thick.

281
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,272
Maybe there's a way around it.

282
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,311
What is all this stuff?

283
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,110
My best guess? There's a geothermal
generator behind this wall.

284
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,350
That's the power source.

285
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,712
Careful with these pipes.
They are very hot.

286
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,555
That's it. Nothing. It's blocked.

287
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,235
So, what do you think, Sayid?

288
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,709
- What do I think about what, Jack?
- This place, the computer.

289
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,432
What do you think is going on?

290
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,679
The last time I heard of concrete being
poured over everything in this way...

291
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,432
was Chernobyl.

292
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,029
- Did you hit something?
- I don't think so.

293
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,270
It's coming from over there.

294
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,671
I'm gonna check it out.

295
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
- Hey.
- Hey.

296
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,996
You took a shower.

297
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,150
Had to see if it worked.

298
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,957
How was it?

299
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,277
Pressure sucked
and it kind of went cold at one point,

300
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,148
and it smelled a little bit
like sulphur, but it was a shower.

301
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,356
Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean.

302
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,278
You could use one.

303
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,876
Maybe a little later.

304
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,996
I'll leave the shampoo for you.

305
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,356
- I'm Libby.
- Michael.

306
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,076
How many of you? You know,
on the other side of the island?

307
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,633
When we left, around 40.

308
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,760
How many of you survived?

309
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,717
Twenty-three of us.

310
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,991
Are you all right?

311
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,995
Now you give a damn.

312
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,717
I said I'm sorry.
It was a misunderstanding.

313
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,195
A misunderstanding is when you bring me
lemonade instead of iced tea.

314
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,999
- I said no talking.
- He was talking to me!

315
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,836
We're here.

316
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,234
What are you gonna do, beam us up?

317
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,275
I thought you said
there were 23 of you.

318
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,270
There were.

319
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,556
Hi, Sun.

320
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,837
What's wrong?

321
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,314
I found something out in the water.

322
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,030
And I told Shannon about it,
and we thought you should know...

323
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,555
It's the messages from the raft.

324
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,275
We thought you should decide what to do.

325
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,155
Why did you tell Charlie, man?

326
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,593
- Because he asked, Hugo.
- You shouldn't have.

327
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,719
You should have listened to me about
coming down here. It's all gonna change.

328
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,598
- Everything.
- Change is good, Hugo.

329
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,309
You know, people say that,
but it's not true, man.

330
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,312
Trust me, I know.
And guess who gets to be the bad guy?

331
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,631
Who says "No, you can't have
peanut butter for the cute blonde

332
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,110
and her poor island baby."
You know who? It's me.

333
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,359
You know what? I'm not gonna do it.
Find someone else to deal with the chow.

334
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,271
No, we all have our jobs, Hugo.

335
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,591
Mine is to convince people
to push a button every 108 minutes

336
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,910
without them knowing why or for what.

337
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,995
- Wanna trade?
- I don't wanna do this, man.

338
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,150
I've had lots of jobs
I didn't want to do.

339
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,356
But I still did them.

340
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,431
I'm sorry, Hugo,

341
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,830
you don't get to quit.

342
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,957
OK, then.

343
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,999
- Be careful!
- Dude. I am.

344
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,511
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

345
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,750
All right. Let's go!

346
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,799
- Do you think we got enough gnomes?
- We're good.

347
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,479
- This is genius.
- No, no, to the left, dude.

348
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,671
- More of an angle.
- Hey!

349
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,829
Run!

350
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,598
Cluck you, Randy!

351
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,155
Freedom!

352
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,231
- Dude, what are you doing?
- Freedom!

353
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,475
So, anything else you wanna do tonight?

354
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,633
You better let me know now, because our
day off is just about over, Huggy Bear.

355
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,393
In about ten hours we're gonna have
to find ourselves some new employment.

356
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,600
I hear Pizza Bin is hiring.
Or we could try our luck at Gyro-rama.

357
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,035
I do kind of dig the chick
who works at the Bin.

358
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,430
Dude, promise me something.

359
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,078
OK, what?

360
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,157
Promise me that no matter what happens,
we'll never change.

361
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,992
This'll never change.

362
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,516
OK. Oh! I know what this is about.

363
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,319
I know why you've been
acting so weird lately.

364
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,951
You're getting that stomach-stapling
surgery thing, aren't you?

365
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,508
- I'm not getting surgery.
- Come on, it's cool.

366
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,272
I can still be all surprised,

367
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,955
I can be like,
"Ooh, my, Hurley. Wow, is that you?"

368
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,235
Listen, Johnny, I'm serious.

369
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,235
Promise me that you and I
will always stay the same.

370
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:58,110
I'll do you one better. Not only will I
stay gold, Ponyboy, I will drink to it.

371
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,878
Can I borrow two bucks?

372
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,430
What you got there, Hurley?

373
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,438
It's dynamite.

374
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,159
Dynamite?
Well, what are you doing with it?

375
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,389
I'm sorry.
But I can't let it happen again.

376
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,475
Why is there a news crew here?

377
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,035
Dude, we shouldn't go here.

378
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,435
Dude, let's go,
they jack the prices here.

379
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,158
Maybe somebody got shot.

380
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:02,513
Yeah, one guy.
And I was there, you know.

381
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,716
I was right next to him.

382
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,829
Why are you doing this, honey?

383
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,833
- Look, just get out of here, Rose.
- But you're gonna hurt somebody.

384
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,639
Not if I do it from outside the door.
It's thick.

385
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,793
And I'll make sure there's nobody around
first. So, please, will you just go?

386
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,395
Uh-uh. You haul me off the beach
and you drag me into this place,

387
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,790
the least I can get is an explanation
before you blow it up.

388
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,236
You don't get it.
This is gonna mess it all up!

389
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,314
Dude! Somebody won the lottery!

390
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:46,509
Let me tell you something, Rose. We were
all fine before we had any potato chips.

391
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,910
Now we've got these potato chips,
everyone's gonna want them.

392
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,195
So, Steve gets them, Charlie's pissed,

393
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,714
but not pissed at Steve,
he's pissed at me.

394
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,950
That's the guy!

395
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,551
That's the guy!

396
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,511
And I'm gonna be in the middle of it.

397
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,037
And then it's gonna be, "What about us?"
"Why didn't I get any potato chips?"

398
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,078
"Help us out, Hurley.
Why did you give Kate the shampoo?"

399
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,151
"Why didn't I get the peanut butter?"

400
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,118
Then, they'll get really mad
and start asking,

401
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,556
"Why does Hugo have everything?
Why should he get to decide?"

402
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,835
Then they'll all hate me.

403
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,917
I don't know what to do.

404
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,397
Come on, Jack, the inventory's done.
This is the only way.

405
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,118
Are you serious?

406
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,077
Dude, there's enough food in there

407
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,277
to feed one guy three meals a day
for another three months.

408
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,352
We have 40 people.
It's just not gonna work.

409
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,833
Look, you put me in charge,
this is what we're doing.

410
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,359
OK.

411
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,390
- OK?
- Yeah. OK.

412
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,319
OK.

413
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,597
Excuse me.

414
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,793
Hi.

415
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,309
Back where you guys,
where you came from...

416
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,875
is there a woman named Rose there?

417
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,315
Black chick in her fifties?

418
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,877
Is she...

419
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,315
is she OK?

420
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,998
Yeah, man. She's OK.

421
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,870
Oh, thank you.

422
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,751
Michael. I'm Michael.

423
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,950
Thank you, Michael.

424
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,715
I'm Bernard.

425
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,873
OK.

426
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,030
It's OK. She's good.
