1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,998
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,638
Tequila and tonic.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,598
- Ana Lucia.
- Jack.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,875
We'll have the next drink on the plane,
OK?

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,433
- 42F.
- 42F. Right.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,037
All right, all of you get up.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,629
Sawyer!

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,518
Help me make a stretcher.
We're gonna carry him.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,509
Walt!

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,231
- Walt!
- Shannon!

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,358
Shannon!

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,758
So, how you doing?

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,598
Well, the family
with the screaming baby moved.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,796
Well, you must be thrilled.

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,232
Actually, it's too quiet now.

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,036
So, how's Danny?
You two trying to work things out?

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,189
There's nothing to work out. He left.

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,872
You OK with that?

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,753
I guess you could say I'm one of those
people who's just better off alone.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,953
- So how was the firing range?
- Good.

21
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,914
How did it feel to hold a gun again?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,152
- Very good.
- All these steps count, Ana.

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,152
You've come a long way
since we met four months ago.

24
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,398
She say?

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,988
You know, when I can come back to work?

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,034
She left the final determination
up to me.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,872
Right.

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,151
Do you think you're ready?

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,471
What do you think?

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,108
Welcome back to the force,
Officer Cortez.

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,955
Sayid! Sayid, no!

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,111
- He's one of us!
- No!

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,999
Let go!

34
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,039
Stop! Stop!

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,393
Let go!

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,550
Hey! Hey!

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,915
Don't move! Nobody move!

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,956
Nobody move! Nobody!

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,070
Does he have anything else on him?

40
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,559
- What?
- He just had a gun to your neck.

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,393
Check to see if he has
anything else on him.

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,390
- What is your problem?
- Ana!

45
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,719
Get back! Get back, both of you!

46
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,392
Are you crazy?

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,198
- Ana.
- Now!

48
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,918
Ana!

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,515
We need to tie him up.

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,074
- I'm not tying him up.
- He tried to kill you.

51
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,639
No.

52
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,390
You. You do it.

53
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,400
Tie him.

54
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,836
- Use the vines from the stretcher.
- If we take that thing apart,

55
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,751
- we won't be able to...
- Shut up!

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,230
Ana, Sawyer needs a doctor,
or he'll die.

57
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,678
I know what I'm doing.

58
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,914
I hope this is all of it.

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
- That's all we've got right now.
- OK.

60
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,038
Thanks, Captain.

61
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,034
Come on in.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,676
Hey, look who's here. Good to see you,
Ana Lucia. Welcome back.

63
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,273
Thanks, Raggs.

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,555
I'll, get you those IRs, Captain.

65
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,676
- Today.
- You've got it.

66
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,711
How are you?

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,109
Good. Fine.

68
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,235
Good.

69
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,956
Your assignment.

70
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,472
Evidence?
You're putting me behind a desk?

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,790
- That a problem?
- I want patrol.

72
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,553
- I don't care what you want.
- Just put me in a car.

73
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,791
You were in an
officer-involved shooting. No.

74
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,234
Both.

75
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,916
I need to be back on the street. Please.

76
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,635
I put you in a car,
everyone's gonna know I pulled strings.

77
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,395
You don't want me to treat you
like my daughter? Don't ask for favours.

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,471
Then transfer me.

79
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,678
You don't get the transfer,
but I'll give you the car.

80
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,119
- Happy?
- Sorry to bother you, Captain.

81
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,272
Ana, there's a call for you.
They say it's real important.

82
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,590
Thanks, Raggs, I'll be right there.

83
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,990
They got you a cake.

84
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,711
Try and act surprised.

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,518
Jack, nice to see you out of the hatch.
You could use more sunshine.

86
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,393
- I'll take that under advisement.
- Little fruit might do you good, too.

87
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,711
Good for the constitution.
Least that's what they say.

88
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,268
Well, if that's what they say.

89
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,554
Where did you get these?

90
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,916
Just cos you're excited,
no reason to talk with your mouth full.

91
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,189
Past the hanging tree,
double or nothing.

92
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,235
You sure?

93
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,595
There's no way
you're hitting it that far.

94
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,875
Hurley, the woman's on bloody steroids.

95
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,754
Double's 10,000 bucks.

96
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,308
That's nothing to someone
worth $150 million.

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,675
He'll build you your own course.

98
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,911
- What's he talking about?
- Ignore him, he's an idiot.

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,593
Crap!

100
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,556
You hooked it.

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,436
Try keeping your left arm straight.

102
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,551
You're giving me tips?

103
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,474
Kate. I'm a doctor.

104
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,995
So you think you could do better?

105
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,029
Anyone can hit a ball. That's not golf.

106
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,876
And what's golf?

107
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,400
Golf is accuracy.

108
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,959
Well, why don't we play a few holes and
see which one of us is more accurate?

109
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,917
Fighting talk.

110
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,397
- You're kidding, right?
- Three holes. No handicap.

111
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,550
We play for bragging rights.

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,198
What are we waiting for?

113
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,432
Ana, let's just get to their camp.

114
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,750
It was an accident. They'll understand.

115
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,037
They'll understand?
I killed one of them.

116
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,590
Those two move, shout.

117
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,557
Wait. What are you doing?

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,391
Untie me.

119
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,756
- I'm not...
- Untie me!

120
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,039
Ana.

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,911
What are you doing?

122
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,235
I'm taking him back to his camp.

123
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,912
Don't leave.

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,390
Please.
If that were you, he'd let you die.

125
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,471
I am not doing it for him.

126
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,191
I am doing it for me.

127
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,075
<i>1- Adam-7, assault with a deadly weapon</i>

128
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,153
<i>convenience store on Alvarado and</i>
<i>Reservoir. Please respond, code three.</i>

129
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,674
So, that shrink give you any good drugs?

130
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,673
Not that kind of shrink.

131
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,115
- Did you miss me?
- Boy, did I.

132
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,316
I heard about you and Danny.

133
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,870
Want me to go kick his ass for you?

134
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,274
Nah, it's better this way.

135
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
What are we doing in Westwood?

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,434
Thought a change of scenery
would be nice.

137
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,712
Nice, safe neighbourhood
for your first day back.

138
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,638
- This was her idea, wasn't it?
- She is the captain.

139
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,832
<i>8- Adam-9. Please respond to a domestic</i>
<i>disturbance call, 2210 south Veteran.</i>

140
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,397
This is 8-Adam-16.

141
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,277
- That's not our call.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

142
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,319
We're just three blocks away
from that call on Veteran. We got it.

143
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,516
<i>Copy that, 8-Adam-16.</i>

144
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,350
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

145
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,910
Not the TV, Travis! The TV is mine!
You bring that back!

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,150
- I bought it with my money!
- Liar!

147
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,836
- Did you call the cops?
- What?

148
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,990
Do something useful, Shawna, shut up!

149
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,629
- Arrest him! He's stealing my TV!
- She hit me! She hit me!

150
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,280
- Hey! Enough! Both of you.
- Shut that kid up!

151
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,272
What are you gonna do? Hit me again?
Hit the baby?

152
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,478
Shut that kid up!

153
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,633
- Both of you!
- Put your hands where I can see them!

154
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,156
- Get down on the ground!
- All right.

155
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,038
- Officer Cortez!
- Ma'am, get your baby upstairs.

156
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,997
- Ana Lucia!
- Hands on the ground!

157
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,150
Ana Lucia!

158
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,879
- It's all right! OK, OK!
- He is down.

159
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,397
- I'm down! I'm down!
- Holster your weapon.

160
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,478
Now.

161
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,919
Hey.

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,913
- I think you should let him go.
- No.

163
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,153
- He's gonna come after me.
- You don't know that.

164
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,476
I killed someone he loves.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,594
Sit down. Now.

166
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,395
I'm bringing him water.

167
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,277
You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,275
Don't even think of untying him.

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,510
Who is that woman?

170
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,751
Her name is Ana Lucia.

171
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,551
She was on the plane. Tail section.
They all were.

172
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,798
- We were bringing them back.
- Where is Walt?

173
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,191
They took him.

174
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,558
The Others.

175
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,837
- What do you mean they took him?
- From the raft. The night we left.

176
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,633
Hey, man...

177
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,115
Hey, we're gonna get out of this, man.

178
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,236
- Guess you're first.
- Lucky me.

179
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,633
The ladies' tee at my club back home
is ten feet closer...

180
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,709
Shut up, Jack.

181
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,757
Nice.

182
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,637
You're up.

183
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,711
Wow.

184
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,635
You really put it in there.

185
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,990
We have more balls.
You can take a drop.

186
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,071
I'm good.

187
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,712
Got it.

188
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,511
You may wanna move.

189
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,079
What?

190
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,396
Where is the doctor?

191
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,156
I got him. I got him.

192
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,549
- Where we headed?
- Bathroom.

193
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,599
He's burning up. We've gotta get him in
the shower and bring this fever down.

194
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,398
What can I do?

195
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,151
OK, go through the medical stash,
there's a bottle of ofloxacin.

196
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,356
- Ofloxacin.
- Little white pills.

197
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,749
Bring the alcohol
and some gauze patches,

198
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,515
then strip that bed and make sure
it's got clean sheets on it.

199
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,396
- Kate!
- Yeah, yeah.

200
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,471
What happened?

201
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,990
John, the button.

202
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,911
Hello.

203
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,318
Hello.

204
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,994
Hey.

205
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,075
What are we doing here, Ana?

206
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,268
I mean, their camp has gotta be close.

207
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,830
I just want to get back to my wife.

208
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,633
How long have I kept you alive out here,
Bernard?

209
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,390
That's right.

210
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,272
- So cut me some slack.
- Hey.

211
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,191
We just want to know what you're doing.
What's the plan?

212
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,271
She has no plan.

213
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,918
She only has her guilt and a gun.

214
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,556
You want a plan?

215
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,034
Do you have any ammo
back at your camp?

216
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,315
- What?
- Ammo, for the gun.

217
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,516
Do you have any, back at your camp?

218
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,229
- Yeah, a couple boxes.
- All right. I want it.

219
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,233
At least half.
And I'll need a pack, a big one.

220
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,030
A blanket, some medicine, clothes,
jeans and socks.

221
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,511
- You getting all this?
- I got it.

222
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,716
All right.

223
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,952
You bring all of that stuff back to me,
and I'll let your friend go.

224
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,829
- I'm not leaving them.
- Michael, you should.

225
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,990
- No. We stay together.
- Go.

226
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,795
I'll be back, man.

227
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,318
Ana, what are you doing?

228
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,235
You can't live out here alone.

229
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,196
I'm already alone.

230
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,157
I'll sign us out.

231
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,710
- What, you're talking to me now?
- I just wanna go home, AL.

232
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,553
Hey, I ordered that guy to stop twice.

233
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,677
So every time we run into some yoyo
with a TV in his hands

234
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,558
- you're gonna draw down?
- Hey, Ana Lucia.

235
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,271
Your guy? We got him.

236
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,350
His name is Jason McCormack.

237
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,989
We picked him up on an assault
on an elderly woman in Echo Park.

238
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,278
His fingerprints matched a partial
from your crime scene. He confessed.

239
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,830
The DA's ready to file charges.
All he needs is for you to ID him.

240
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,116
- It's not him.
- He confessed.

241
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,710
- I don't know him.
- Can you guys give us a minute?

242
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,232
- Why are you doing this?
- Because it's not him.

243
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,115
He put four bullets into you.
Hollow points through your vest.

244
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,316
He tried to kill you.

245
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,676
You want a list of his priors?
You want him back out on the street?

246
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,396
It's not him.

247
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,270
What happened?

248
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,795
Out there, what happened?

249
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,670
- There was an accident.
- What kind of accident?

250
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,354
A girl was shot... and killed.

251
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,431
- What did she look like?
- She was tall, with blonde hair.

252
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,275
- There was an Arab man.
- Shannon.

253
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,635
There were five of you
from the tail section?

254
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,869
Four.

255
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,396
Why didn't the rest of them come
back with you? And Michael, Jin...

256
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,755
They cannot come back right now.

257
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,235
Can you take me to them?

258
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,033
No.

259
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,397
Here you go.

260
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,349
What's happening?
Why is he shaking?

261
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,831
He's septic. The infection's
gotten into the blood stream.

262
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,629
If the antibiotics don't bring the fever
down, he'll go into shock.

263
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,991
Hold him up.

264
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,076
OK, I got him.

265
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,876
No, swallow it, swallow it.

266
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,394
- Damn it.
- Here, I'll do it.

267
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,550
- No, no, I got it.
- I can do it.

268
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,991
Sawyer.

269
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,396
It's Kate.

270
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,229
You need to listen to me, OK?

271
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,069
The only way that you are going
to get better is if you take this pill.

272
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,029
So I need you to swallow it, OK?

273
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,671
OK, here we go.

274
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,149
Now swallow.

275
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,912
Swallow.

276
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,309
Good, good. That's good.

277
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,873
Nice job.

278
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,549
We didn't learn the "whisper-in-the-ear"
thing in med school.

279
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,357
What are you doing?

280
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,399
I'm going, Ana.
I don't want to be a part of this.

281
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,270
I know everything you've done for us.

282
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,436
And I wouldn't even be alive
if it weren't for you.

283
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,590
But I'm going.

284
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,676
What about you?

285
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,676
I just don't think
you're the best judge of character.

286
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,359
I was with you
when you put Nathan in the pit.

287
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,352
All right.

288
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,874
You wanna go? Go.

289
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,073
Leave.

290
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,274
You, go.

291
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,796
Get out of here.

292
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,073
Go.

293
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,876
Michael!

294
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,869
Listen. It's all right. Jin is OK.

295
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,871
What happened? Where is he?

296
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,155
He's fine. And I'll explain.

297
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,308
But right now I need to find Jack.

298
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,951
Where are they?

299
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,074
I said where are they?

300
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,958
- Jack, it's not his...
- Shannon's dead! I'm not...

301
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,308
You're gonna take me back out there.
Right now.

302
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,789
He isn't the problem.
He brought Sawyer back.

303
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,917
Half dead with a bullet hole
in his shoulder, John!

304
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,432
Are you gonna talk to me,
or are you just gonna sit there?

305
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,838
Anything I say will only make you angry.

306
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,077
So yes, I will sit here.

307
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,272
Jack!

308
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,992
Michael.

309
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,471
We got a problem, man.

310
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,109
- Remember how to get out there?
- I think so.

311
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,236
We should stop and think about this.

312
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,154
Think about what, John? Shannon's dead.
Sayid's being held at gunpoint.

313
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,756
You want to sit here and hope that
situation resolves itself, be my guest.

314
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,996
- You know how to use this?
- Guess so.

315
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,713
Stop!

316
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,717
Please.

317
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,349
What do you want?

318
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,399
- Excuse me?
- Peace, revenge, justice?

319
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,755
And you are going out
with all these guns.

320
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,998
- What do you want?
- All of our people back here safely.

321
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,311
- Your friend...
- Ana Lucia made a mistake.

322
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,077
What did you say?

323
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,115
Ana Lucia made a mistake.

324
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,076
Ana Lucia?

325
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,630
I will take you there.

326
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,029
But only you.

327
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,711
And no guns.

328
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,153
Let's go.

329
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,196
Where you from?

330
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,309
Where are you from?

331
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,631
I'm from Iraq.

332
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,871
You have any kids?

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,116
Why are you asking me
if I have children?

334
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,159
- I'm curious.
- I do not. Do you have children?

335
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,873
No.

336
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,951
Are you going to kill me?

337
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,709
That's what you're thinking about,
isn't it?

338
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,311
Should I?

339
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,394
Almost 40 days ago on this very island,

340
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,159
I tied a man to a tree
and I tortured him.

341
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,193
I tortured him as I tortured many men.

342
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,198
Men whose voices
I still hear in the night.

343
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,236
Should you kill me?

344
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,916
Maybe you should.

345
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,035
Maybe you are meant to.

346
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,750
I'm a cop.

347
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,996
I was a cop.

348
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,712
One night, my partner and I
responded to a burglary call.

349
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,431
We were the first ones there. I covered
the front and he went around the back.

350
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,799
I was there a minute, then this kid
comes right through the front door.

351
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,516
I tell him to put his hands up.

352
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,355
And he says I'm making a mistake.

353
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,276
That he's a student.

354
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,710
And he wants to show me his ID.

355
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,396
I believed him.

356
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,438
I just...

357
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,911
I let him reach.

358
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,551
All I remember was a pop.

359
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,992
By the time I hit the ground
I thought I was dead.

360
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,516
I feel dead.

361
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,990
What happened to him?
The man who shot you?

362
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,677
- Oh, yeah!
- Who's up next?

363
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,150
- Way to go!
- Catch you later, man. See ya!

364
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,151
Yeah, on the flip.

365
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,279
Hey.

366
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,629
Jason.

367
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,351
I know you?

368
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,996
I was pregnant.

369
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,871
What happened to him?

370
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,473
Nothing. They never found him.

371
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,637
Go ahead.

372
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,959
Pick it up.

373
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,711
I deserve it.

374
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,273
What good would it be to kill you...

375
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,796
if we're both already dead?

376
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,313
Hey.

377
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,351
Hey, can you hear me?

378
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,755
You're gonna be OK.

379
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,274
You're gonna be all right.

380
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,911
You're home.
