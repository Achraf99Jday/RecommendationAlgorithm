1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,349
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,514
The Others are coming. You have
only three choices: run, hide, or die.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,160
- We do have a plan.
- Yeah, go to the jungle,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,596
get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,
hide everyone inside.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,159
No.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,675
Stop! Stop it!

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,877
Stop it, we can't!
Stop, don't light it!

8
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,715
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

9
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,360
4, 8. We're dead.
15. Doomed and dead.

10
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,919
- 16. 23.
- Hurley, you OK?

11
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,798
Huh? Yeah. Awesome.
I just... have to pee.

12
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,678
Great idea, dude,
go look in the burning death hole.

13
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,512
What is it?

14
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,636
It doesn't matter what it is.

15
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,110
We blew the door so we could
get everyone inside so they'd be safe.

16
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,954
That plan is not gonna work.
We'll never get everyone down in time.

17
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,073
- Water.
- Shallow. Sounds like a puddle.

18
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,957
- 40 feet down?
- 50, tops.

19
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,350
We could use the wire from the fuselage,
rig up a harness...

20
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,274
- John, we're leaving now.
- Yes. Great idea, let's do that.

21
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,989
- We all went through a lot to get here.
- The ladder is broken.

22
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,279
You're gonna lower
40 people down there one by one?

23
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,874
They're waiting for us
to tell them what do,

24
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,871
- so forget the harnesses.
- Jack...

25
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,518
What?

26
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,750
Why don't we all just calm down here?

27
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,992
No, if you wanna go exploring in the
morning, fine, but tonight we're done.

28
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,073
I'm gonna get the dynamite we didn't use
and we're heading back to the caves.

29
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,109
So how about you pack it up, John?

30
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,072
Sure. Of course.

31
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,759
OK.

32
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,833
Why don't you want to go down there,
Jack?

33
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,395
Female, late twenties, no ID.
Coded twice on the way over here...

34
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,994
- Where's the other one?
- They're on their way.

35
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,878
- Fire department had to use the jaws.
- What do we got?

36
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,952
- Female, late twenties, auto accident.
- What is that?

37
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,635
A piece of the steering column.
Let's go. Keep that collar steady.

38
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,076
- Page my father. Tell me.
- Tyre blew, car jumped the divider,

39
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,639
- hit an SUV.
- BP's dropping!

40
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,950
Pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?

41
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,474
- Yeah. Alone.
- Where's the driver of the SUV?

44
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,837
- Tube Mr Rutherford...
- I can't intubate, you've got to.

45
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,310
- Dr Shephard, her BP's 80<i>l</i>60.
- His breathing's deteriorating.

46
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,911
- Let's get a move on.
- OK. I need a syringe. A big one.

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,150
- You, hold pressure.
- Five gauge.

48
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,356
- Pupils?
- Fixed and dilated.

49
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,837
...guys.
- By carotid.

50
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,718
88<i>l</i>52, no radial pulse.

51
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,950
I know, I know. Sac's flooded.

52
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,632
- Where's that...
- Here. Got it?

53
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,039
Yep.

54
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,112
- He's dropping, come on.
- Doctor, we're losing him!

55
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,157
BP's stabilizing.

56
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,515
Time of death: 8.15am.

57
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,555
- OK. Get me a blood gas and a C spine.
- Right away, doctor.

58
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,234
Get her up to ICU
and keep her immobilised.

59
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,515
I wanna dance at my wedding.

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,960
- Did you hear that?
- You need to take it easy, OK?

61
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,996
- Just relax...
- What did she say?

62
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,109
She said she has to dance
at her wedding.

63
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,316
I wanna dance.

64
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,511
OK, no one is out there.
No one is coming.

65
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,192
But the French woman said...

66
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,794
The French woman
is missing a bloody wing nut.

67
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,440
I mean, it was all bollocks.
It's a ghost story.

68
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,715
She set the fire herself.

69
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,872
What?

70
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,632
Nothing.

71
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,629
Has anyone seen Vincent?

72
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,995
- The dog? Anyone seen him?
- No, I haven't.

73
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,830
- Has anyone seen the dog?
- No.

74
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,638
- Where are you going?
- I lost the damn dog.

75
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,350
Why'd you do that?

76
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,237
Why'd you light the fuse, man?

77
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,430
Why wouldn't I light the fuse?

78
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,277
Maybe because I was running
towards you, waving my arms,

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,351
yelling, "Don't do that!"

80
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,955
Well, you've got a point there.

81
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,835
I guess I was excited to get inside.
That's why we came here, isn't it?

82
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,990
That's why we went out
to the Black Rock,

83
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,116
and got the dynamite to blow the hatch.

84
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,316
We did it so we could get inside, Hugo.

85
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,277
And to save everybody's lives.

86
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,111
And to save everyone's lives.

87
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,349
Or maybe it was just our destiny.
Right, John?

88
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,873
Maybe.

89
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,317
Guys. It's the hatch door.
You'd better see this.

90
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,591
- Vincent!
- This is not a good idea.

91
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,398
I saw him five minutes ago.

92
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,994
Besides,
you said there wasn't anyone out here.

93
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,718
I said we didn't see anyone.

94
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,394
The dog will come back on his own,
he always does.

95
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,516
Watching that dog was the one thing
anybody ever asked me to do.

96
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,830
If something happens to him...

97
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,959
When was the last time you slept or had
something to eat? You're exhausted.

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,271
I can't tell that kid I lost his dog
because I was exhausted.

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,709
- I'll circle around behind him.
- OK.

100
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,794
Vincent!

101
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,558
Sayid?

102
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,352
Sayid?

103
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,795
Where are you!? Sayid!

104
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,679
Sayid?

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,629
Walt?

106
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,876
What are you doing here?

107
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,119
Shannon!

108
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,759
What is it?

109
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,239
What?

110
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,269
Why do you want to get down there
so bad?

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,271
"-ly". Why do I want to get down there
so "badly"?

112
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,117
Jack thinks I'm crazy, doesn't he?

113
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,113
Why? Cos you want to drop into a
hatch that's been locked from the inside

114
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,397
by a foot-thick steel door
that says "Quarantine"?

115
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,755
Look at the bright side:
the damage is done.

116
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,195
Bright side.

117
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,909
And if Jack thinks I've lost it,
I can't blame him, really.

118
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,992
Then again, five hours ago
I was pulled into a hole

119
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,514
by what appeared to be
a column of black smoke.

120
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,151
Did you see it, Kate?

121
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,036
Then I guess we're both crazy.

122
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,510
I wonder what Jack thinks he saw.

123
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,989
You should go ahead, man. Don't want
Locke making time with your girl.

124
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,354
Joke, dude.

125
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,112
Not really in the mood, Hurley.

126
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,431
Really? Wow.
Usually you're like, Mr Ha-ha.

127
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,832
There ya go. Life's not so bad, right?

128
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,159
Sure, the Others
are coming to like, eat us all,

129
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,312
and every once in a while
someone blows up all over you,

130
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,709
but we do get to sleep in every morning.

131
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,031
And the numbers?

132
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,471
- What?
- "The numbers are bad."

133
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,155
That's what you were yelling
right when I tackled you.

134
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,279
- Yeah. It's kind of a long story.
- I've got time.

135
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,035
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Try me.

136
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,551
A while ago, I was in this kind of psych
ward and there was this guy, Leonard.

137
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,757
All the time I knew him,
all he ever said were these numbers.

138
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,992
"4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42".
Over and over and over again.

139
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,116
And they kind of got stuck in my head.

140
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,034
So when I got out... well, actually
a couple months after I got out,

141
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,908
I was buying a frozen burrito and
thought "I should play the lottery",

142
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,356
and I guess those numbers
were stuck in my head, so I played them.

143
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,750
And I won... $114 million.

144
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,992
That's when it started happening.
My grandpa died,

145
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,389
my house caught on fire,

146
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,677
the chicken joint that I worked at
got hit by a meteor...

147
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,115
Well, actually, a meteorite.

148
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,318
OK, so, tonight, I see the same
freaking numbers on that hatch thing.

149
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,356
Just written on the side.

150
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,149
And that's why I tried to stop it,
because that thing is cursed, man.

151
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,549
You were in a psych ward?

152
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,389
- I'm not crazy.
- I'm not saying you are.

153
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,350
- So, what, that's it? That's all?
- What do you want me to say?

154
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,796
- How about you believe me?
- Hurley, they're numbers.

155
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,795
What's that thing where doctors make you
feel better just by talking to you?

156
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,269
- Bedside manner.
- Yeah, that.

157
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,311
Yours sucks, dude.

158
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,991
What happened to him?

159
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,791
Just try to relax, OK?

160
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,955
The car that I hit.
The other driver was older...

161
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,192
He died in the ER.

162
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,152
I can't feel anything.

163
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,358
I know.

164
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,430
What's happened to me?

165
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,955
You have a fracture dislocation
of your thoracic lumbar spine,

166
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,190
with multiple crushed vertebrae.

167
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,031
Your back is broken.

168
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,672
Your spleen is ruptured

169
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,558
and bleeding into your abdomen
and has to be stopped.

170
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,200
I'm gonna operate
and repair as much as possible,

171
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,513
but even the most optimistic result puts
the likelihood of retaining any feeling

172
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,989
or mobility anywhere
below the waist at...

173
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,709
extremely unlikely.

174
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,797
Dr Shephard, may I have a word, please?

175
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,719
- So, what'd I do wrong?
- You did something wrong?

176
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,948
- You're frowning.
- My face is always this way.

177
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,032
Dad, hey, come on, let's hear it.

178
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,671
You might want to try handing out
some hope every once in a while?

179
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,829
Even if there's
a 99 per cent probability

180
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,070
that they're hopelessly screwed,

181
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,358
folks are much more inclined
to hear that one per cent chance

182
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,670
that things are gonna be OK.

183
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,751
Her spine is crushed.

184
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,879
I tell her that everything's
gonna be OK, that's false hope, Dad.

185
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,996
Maybe. Maybe.

186
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,795
But it's still hope.

187
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,669
<i>X- ray to the ER.</i>

188
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,269
I know what I saw!
It was him. It was Walt.

189
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
- Please lower your voice.
- I heard whispers.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,319
- Where?
- Everywhere.

191
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,709
- What whispers? Who?
- I don't know! "Them".

192
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,633
- Something happened to the raft?
- Nothing happened.

193
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,156
- Walt was with your husband, Sawyer...
- Sayid, I know what I saw!

194
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,276
They're back.

195
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,708
Locke found a...

196
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,588
...hatch in the ground
about a half mile from here.

197
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,638
We left to blow it open
so we could hide inside.

198
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,712
So all of us could hide inside
in case...

199
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,635
But it doesn't matter,
it's not gonna work,

200
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,393
there's no way for all of us
to get in there tonight.

201
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,199
Jack, where's Dr Arzt?

202
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
- He didn't make it.
- What?

203
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,115
- Oh, my God.
- Did you see them?

204
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,829
- Did you see the Others?
- Hey! Shannon! There are no "Others".

205
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,718
- We've had this conversation.
- What would you know?

206
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,997
You didn't see anything.
You don't know! You don't know!

207
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,638
Hey!

208
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,076
Everything's going to be OK.

209
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,436
Let's just... let's take it easy.
We're gonna be all right.

210
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,273
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?
Together.

211
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,875
We've still got four guns.
We'll put lookouts at all the entrances.

212
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,593
We're all gonna be safe
as long as we stay together.

213
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,798
The sun comes up in three hours,

214
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,474
and we are all gonna be here
to see that happen.

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,991
I promise.

216
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,713
- John. What are you doing?
- I'm getting some cable.

217
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,916
What for?

218
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,434
It's for the hatch. I'm going in.

219
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,270
You think that's the smartest thing
to do right now, John?

220
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,079
I doubt it. In fact, you're right.

221
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,755
Safest thing is to stay here.
Wait for morning.

222
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,639
Wait for these "Others",
to see if they ever show up.

223
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,952
Wait for the brave folks on the raft
to bring help.

224
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,629
But me? I'm tired of waiting.

225
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,631
So, do you believe it?

226
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,318
Believe what?

227
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,917
That everything's gonna be OK.

228
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,835
Yeah. I do.

229
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,118
Kind of unlike you.
The whole glass-half-full thing.

230
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,191
There's a glass?

231
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,078
You did a good thing.
Saying what you said.

232
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,270
Taking care of everybody. And just
giving them something to count on.

233
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,630
If you weren't here, Jack...

234
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,111
I'm going to the hatch.

235
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,036
I understand why you can't go. I mean,
they need you here, I get it. I do.

236
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,710
But Locke's going into that thing
whether you like it or not.

237
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,716
And if he falls and breaks his neck...

238
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,470
Live together, die alone, right?

239
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,919
Right.

240
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,550
Your fiancée was seriously injured.

241
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,757
It could take as long as ten,
maybe twelve hours.

242
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,071
I won't know how extensive the damage is
until I get inside.

243
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,830
She was going for a dress fitting
and to look at tablecloths.

244
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,356
When is it? The wedding?

245
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,749
It's eight months.

246
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,433
I'm sure Sarah will have recovered
by then, if...

247
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,353
"Recovered?" What does that mean?

248
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,190
There will be ongoing physical therapy,

249
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,238
- but if she works really hard...
- Will we be able to...

250
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,476
you know... make love?

251
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,150
You need to know that there is a chance

252
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,233
Sarah might very well need professional
care for the rest of her life.

253
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,239
What, like, she won't be able
to go to the bathroom by herself?

254
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,237
Come here.

255
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,437
Come here.

256
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,309
I want to tell you a little secret.

257
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,429
Come on.

258
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,149
Closer.

259
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,358
It's OK.

260
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,148
I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore.

261
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,156
I can still roll around at my wedding.

262
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,671
You're invited, OK?

263
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,311
I'm going to fix you.

264
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,312
Expected to find you
halfway down there by now.

265
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,270
I was waiting for you.

266
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,188
- So you want me to go down first?
- Well, you're lighter.

267
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,795
I can belay you down
and bring you back up just as easy.

268
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,075
Shaft might get
narrower down there, too.

269
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,948
You left out the part where you just
wanna see if I get eaten by something.

270
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,031
Yeah, well. That too.

271
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,676
- Not too tight?
- I've got it.

272
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,359
OK.

273
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,799
Wait.

274
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,317
What do I say if need to stop?

275
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,833
"Stop."

276
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,035
Right. OK. Let's go.

277
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,229
Kate! Are you all right?

278
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,034
Yeah.

279
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,556
I dropped the light.

280
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,676
Maybe we should...

281
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,797
Well, OK, then.

282
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,794
One.

283
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,434
Two.

284
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,874
Three.

285
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,634
Four.

286
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,513
Stop!

287
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,869
What is it?

288
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,599
John! I think there's something down...

289
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,318
Kate, are you all right?

290
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,679
Kate!

291
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,439
You're kidding, right?
You're going back?

292
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,995
- Yeah.
- What about all that stuff you said

293
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,231
about waiting until morning
and watching the sun rise?

294
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,030
I changed my mind.

295
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,399
Kate!

296
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,392
Locke!

297
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,078
Damn it!

298
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,958
- You all right, brother?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

299
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,918
Take it easy, keep the weight off.
Here, let me look.

300
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,277
Does this hurt?

301
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,430
Well, you haven't sprained it, then.

302
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,953
Don't fancy your chances
of catching up, though.

303
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,350
- I wasn't trying to catch up.
- Oh, aye, 'course you weren't.

304
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,271
- What do you know about sprains?
- I was almost a doctor, once.

305
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,275
Small world.

306
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,351
You're a doctor, then?

307
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,149
- So what's your excuse?
- Excuse?

308
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,629
For running
like the Devil's chasing you?

309
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,948
My excuse: I'm training.

310
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,758
- Training for what?
- For a race around the world.

311
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,191
Impressive, I know.

312
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,436
So your excuse better be good, brother.

313
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,595
Just trying to work a few things out.

314
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,831
A girl, right?

315
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,316
- A patient.
- Ah, but, a girl patient.

316
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,992
What's her name?

317
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,190
- Her name's Sarah.
- What'd you do to her, then?

318
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,875
Do to her?

319
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,589
You must have done something worthy
of this self-flagellation.

320
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,912
I told her...

321
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,195
I made a promise I couldn't keep.

322
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,749
I told her I'd fix her and I couldn't.

323
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,073
I failed.

324
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,077
Well, right.

325
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,151
Just one thing...

326
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,232
What if you did fix her?

327
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,192
- I didn't.
- But what if you did?

328
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,035
You don't know
what you're talking about.

329
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,439
I don't? Why not?

330
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,830
With her situation,
that would be a miracle, "brother".

331
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,910
And you don't believe in miracles.

332
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,920
Right. Well, then.
I'm gonna give you some advice, anyway.

333
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,271
You have to lift it up.

334
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,037
Lift it up?

335
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,917
Your ankle. You got to keep it elevated.

336
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,116
It's been nice chatting...

337
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,679
- Jack.
- Jack, I'm Desmond.

338
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,877
Well, good luck, brother.
See you in another life, yeah?

339
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,516
I wouldn't do that.

340
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,831
Where's Kate?

341
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,632
What the hell's...

342
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,839
Am I alive?

343
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,231
Yeah. Yeah, you're alive.

344
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,717
You smell.

345
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,355
- Well, thank you.
- Wow. You really smell.

346
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:08,435
Yeah, I went for a run.

347
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,556
You smell like you ran far.

348
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,912
Well, I showered.
I guess I just didn't cool...

349
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,798
I wanted to get back down here
and check on you and...

350
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,189
It was a <i>tour de stade.</i>

351
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,753
What?

352
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,152
When you run all the steps in every
section of a stadium. Up and down.

353
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,951
Why would you do that?

354
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,798
I'm intense.

355
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,272
- Did you finish?
- No, I hurt my ankle.

356
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,392
That sucks for you.

357
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,469
Is Kevin here? My fiancé?

358
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,591
I didn't see him.

359
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,111
- I'm sure he'll be back in a little...
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

360
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,352
Are you gonna tell me how it went?

361
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,711
Sarah, the...

362
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,193
the damage to your back was extensive.

363
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,315
I did everything that I could,
but your spinal column, I just...

364
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,955
I couldn't repair it.

365
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,434
You're going to be paralysed from the
waist down for the rest of your life.

366
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,512
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Sarah.

367
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,829
You're yanking my chain, right?

368
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,199
No.

369
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,788
Then how come I can wiggle my toes?

370
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,196
Can you feel this?

371
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,955
Yes.

372
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,753
- Can you feel this?
- Yes.

373
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,351
- This?
- Yes.

374
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,591
- This?
- Yes.

375
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,513
Move and I kill him.

376
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,629
Put the gun down.

377
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,517
- Where's Kate?
- Jack, it's OK...

378
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,397
- I said, drop it!
- Where's Kate?

379
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,836
- She's fine. Put down...
- I'm not putting down anything!

380
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,388
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

381
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,595
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke?

382
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,671
Is this your "destiny"?

383
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,595
- "All roads lead here?"
- Jack, calm down.

384
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,390
Lower your gun, or I'll blow
his damned head off, brother!

385
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,671
You?
