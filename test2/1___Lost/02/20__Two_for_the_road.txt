00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,033
Yeah, thanks.

00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,540
What?

3
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,944
Where were you last night?

4
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:16,812
- Home.
- All night?

5
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:20,820
Yeah. I cooked myself some dinner,
watched some TV.

6
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:22,582
What'd you watch?

7
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:28,784
Let's go for a drive.

8
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,068
Remember Jason McCormack?

9
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,497
Found him in a parking lot
just after three in the morning.

10
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,907
He was dead an hour
before anyone saw him.

11
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:48,280
Crime Scene pulled a gun from the
dumpster. Registration was filed off.

12
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:51,340
No prints. No witnesses.
He was executed.

13
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:54,879
Any idea who did it?

14
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:57,921
Yeah, Ana. You did.

15
00:02:58,992 --> 00:03:02,689
This man confesses to shooting you
in cold blood and you refuse to lD him.

16
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,060
So we had to cut him loose.

17
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:07,565
A week later,
he shows up with five bullets in him

18
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,625
because someone shot him in cold blood.

19
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:13,772
Guess I should get a lawyer.

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,243
Look, we both know that this is gonna be
a dead-end investigation.

21
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,713
But, Ana, if you did this... if you did
this, you have to let me help you.

22
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,351
Yeah. Thanks, Mom,
but I don't need your help.

23
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,379
You don't want my help, you're gonna
have to get it from somewhere else.

24
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,560
You're a police officer, Ana.

25
00:03:38,331 --> 00:03:41,129
If you don't respect me,
at least respect that.

26
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,538
Then I quit.

27
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,857

28
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:13,361
How long you gonna keep up
this hunger strike, Henry?

29
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,634
I ever tell you I was a cop?

30
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:28,612
I've been around
a lot of killers in my life.

31
00:04:29,649 --> 00:04:32,413
You know what surprises me
the most about them?

32
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,046
How much they love to talk.

33
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:42,458
But you're different, Henry.

34
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:45,591
Hm?

35
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,826

[man] Long day, huh?

54
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:35,604
Good to see you again.

55
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,007
You, uh, "wanded" me at security.

56
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:44,706
Another one, please.

57
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:47,480
[clears throat]
So how does one get into "wanding"?

58
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:51,880
One stops being a cop.

59
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,984
What a coincidence.
I just stopped being a doctor.

60
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,726
- Why'd you quit?
- I didn't.

61
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:05,169
My son ratted me out
for drinking on the job. Thank you.

[clears throat]

Lost my license.

64
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:12,545
Yeah, I know, it's hilarious.

65
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:15,807
No, no, it's just that,

66
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:19,909
I don't believe that parents
and their kids should work together.

67
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:23,615
- Too many issues.
- I'll drink to that.

68
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:31,488
- So, where you headed?
- Sydney. Sydney, Australia.

69
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,591
You wanna come?

70
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,267
I'm serious.

71
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,566
Why would I go to Sydney with you?

72
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:45,372
Maybe fate has just thrown
the two of us together.

73
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:48,539
You know,
like two drinks in an airport bar.

74
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,312
Why would fate do that?

75
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:56,780
Same reason fate does anything,
so that we can help each other out.

76
00:07:58,324 --> 00:08:00,383
You do need help, right?

77
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:04,423
Unless you don't.

78
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:13,472
What I'm doing down there
could be dangerous.

79
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,838
I need someone to protect me,
a bodyguard.

80
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:20,105
It's perfect for someone who
"stopped being a cop".

81
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,820
- I don't even know your name.
- Ooh. Let's not use real names.

82
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,791
I'll tell you what, why don't you
pick a name for me,

83
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,885
and then I'll pick one for you.

84
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:44,169
- You look like a "Tom".
- Tom. What an excellent name.

85
00:08:44,237 --> 00:08:47,297
And you should be a...

86
00:08:47,373 --> 00:08:48,635
"Sarah".

88
00:09:15,902 --> 00:09:17,836
What happened?

89
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,067
I cut myself shaving.

90
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,743
The guy in the hatch tried to kill me.

91
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,186
You OK?

92
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:40,517
I'm fine. But he won't be.

93
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:44,823
- Hey, Ana?
- What?

94
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,731
Don't do anything stupid.

[clicking, rumbling]

96

If you've come to apologize, I forgive
you for hitting me with your crutch.

97
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,974
I'm so glad my head didn't break it.

98
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,212
Why?

99
00:10:39,185 --> 00:10:40,914
Now that's a broad question.

100

[buzzing]

101
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,647
Why did you try to hurt Ana Lucia
but not me?

102
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,528
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at, John.

103
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:53,429
I was trapped under that blast door.

104
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:58,630
Helpless. You could've crushed my skull.
But you didn't do a thing.

105
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,969
Why didn't you?

106
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,635
Because you're one of the good ones,
John.

107
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:08,472
What? Good what?

108
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:13,117
None of this matters. I'm dead anyway.

109
00:11:14,787 --> 00:11:16,880
The doctor's gone to make a trade,

110
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:19,982
and we both know he'll come back
empty-handed, and then...

111
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,727
I've lost my value.

112
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,991
So either Jack comes back here
and kills me

113
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:31,002
or my people find out where
I'm being held and they do it.

114
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,402
Why would your own people
want to kill you?

115
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:37,306
Because the man in charge...

116
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,244
He's a great man, John, a brilliant man.

117
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,348
But he is not a forgiving man.

118
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,280
He'll kill me because I failed, John.

119
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,752
I failed my mission.

120

That's right; he's still traipsing
around the jungle with Kate.

If you've got a problem because
he's making time with your girlfriend,

00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,371
don't take it out on me, man.

How about you just give me a gun?

165
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:50,525
- You can't stop me!
- Get out! Get out of my house!

166
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:53,258
I pay the mortgage on this house!
And you won't...

167
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:57,263
- I wanna see my daughter!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

168
00:15:57,336 --> 00:16:00,100
Don't you ever come back here!

169
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:02,504
I was just having a conversation
with the lady.

170
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:04,304
[woman] You need help!

171
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:25,259
- Dude, nice hole.
- What is it, Hurley?

172
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,063
Hey, man,
you remember that radio we made?

173
00:16:29,802 --> 00:16:34,239
I was thinking maybe I could get it
to play some music. You know, for Libby.

174
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,205
Well, it worked only once,
and then just for a minute.

175
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:42,609
I've tried several times since
and only gotten static.

176
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:45,344
Here's the thing:
even that would be good.

177
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:49,112
Because Libby would be like,
"It's the thought that counts."

178
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,815
And I'll score major points.

179
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,518
Especially when she sees me
holding it over my head.

180
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,925
And why would you hold a
static-generating radio over your head?

181
00:16:58,164 --> 00:17:01,224
They didn't have Say Anything
in Baghdad? It's awesome.

182
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,699
This dude gets his boom box,

183
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,396
holds it over his head
outside this chick's window,

184
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:09,168
and plays some Peter Gabriel song
for her, and, bam, the girl's his.

185
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,801
I mean, after her dad goes to jail.
But then he gets her.

186
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:15,677
- I think I get the idea.
- You should check it out sometime.

187
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:18,546
I mean, if we ever, you know,
get off this island.

188
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,651
If you want to do something nice
for Libby,

189
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:27,284
there's a beautiful beach
three kilometers from here.

190
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,555
You could take her there.

191
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,228
You think she'd like that?

192
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,398
I took Shannon there once.

193
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:46,040
Michael. Michael.

194
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:52,073
So it worked?

195
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,043
What are you talking about, John?

196
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,112
Your deal. The trade.

197
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:01,416
- If they gave us Michael...
- They didn't give us anything.

198
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:05,489
So it was just a coincidence
that he came wandering out?

199
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,725
I was shouting. He heard my voice.

200
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,761
What? They just let Michael go,

201
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:15,204
hoping we would keep up
our end of the bargain?

202
00:18:15,274 --> 00:18:17,765
You think they're on the honor system?

203
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,980
- Hey.
- Hey.

204
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,787
[twig snaps]

205
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,940
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

206
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,537
I know you're there.

207
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:59,379
Don't make me come in after you.

208
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:04,145
[woman clears throat]

209
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,856
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

210
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,790
Was Little Red Riding Hood following the
Big Bad Wolf back to his stash o' guns?

211
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:19,063
Why don't you gimme
that one right there?

212
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,470
I ain't gonna "gimme" you nothing.

213
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,070
We've been through this, Lucy.

214
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:41,751
What you gonna do now, muchacha?

215
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,865
We need some damn music in here.

216
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,763
[music on]

217
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,431
- Who was she?
- Who was who?

218
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:31,704
- That woman.
- She is a very long story, Sarah.

219
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,308
It's Ana Lucia.

220
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,973
Well, I'm still Tom.

221
00:20:38,884 --> 00:20:42,786
- You're pathetic, that's what you are.
- You bet your sweet ass I am.

222
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:44,083
[screech]

223
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,653
Why are you here?

224
00:20:53,566 --> 00:20:57,058
I'm here because I can't apologize
to my son.

225
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,335
He tried to help me,
so I thanked him by cutting him off.

226
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:03,500
I thanked him by hating him.

227
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:10,847
You came here for the same reason
I did, kiddo.

228
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,781
You ran away.

229
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:26,330
My, my. Look what fate
has delivered up this time.

230
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,435
Come on.

231
00:21:30,502 --> 00:21:34,632
Let's go have a drink or ten and be
pathetic together. What do you say?

232
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,647
No.

233
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,745
No.

234
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:55,820
It's your call.

235
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,259
- [thud]
- Hey, I'm walking here!

236
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,603
Wait!

237
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,764
Don't.

238
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,101
Let's just get the hell out of Sydney.

239
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:16,514
Let's just go. Let's go back.

240
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:21,378
I can't ever go back.

241
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,388
See ya, kiddo.

242
00:22:45,844 --> 00:22:47,709
What?

243
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:51,247
Don't you want my phone number?

244
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,854
You tell anyone about this,

245
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,481
and I'll kill you.

246
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,523
Guess that takes cuddling off the table.

247
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:21,876
- Hey, there.
- Oh!

248
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,482
How's it going?

249
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,919
- This isn't what it looks like.
- And what does it look like?

250
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:34,086
It looks like something...

251
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,388
that it's not.

252
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:43,860
Aw, man, I'm so busted.

253
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:47,531
Hurley, I'm not here to tell you
how to act around food.

254
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:52,143
No, I'm not busted for that.
I'm busted for...

255
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,270
something else.

256
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,150
I was packing a picnic,

257
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:03,746
because I was kind of hoping
that you'd wanna go with me.

258
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:06,518
You know, as an "us" thing.

259
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,858
But it was a surprise.

260
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,194
Really?

261
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:20,739
That's very sweet.

262
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:27,673
So, do you wanna go?

263
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:31,443
- Where to?
- Can that part still be a surprise?

264
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,284
Yeah.

265
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,458
- Hey. You're back.
- Hey.

266
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:56,464
So, the Others, they didn't show up?

267
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:59,443
No. Michael's back, though.

268
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:05,810
- What happened here?
- [Locke] My fault.

269
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,115
I left the tap on in the bathroom sink,

270
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:12,453
and Ana wiped out and hit her head
on the counter. And I'm sorry, again.

271
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,662
Yeah, don't worry about it.

272
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:19,720
- [Michael groans]
- [Kate] Jack?

273
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:21,564
Jack.

274
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:24,168
I think he's waking up.

275
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:28,070
- [Michael jabbers]
- Michael! Hey, Michael?

276
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:32,441
- Jack?
- [laughs] Hey, man.

277
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:36,106
Man, where...
How did I get...

278
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:39,548
Wait, try to take it easy, OK?
You're back in the hatch.

279
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:42,109
We found you out in the jungle
last night.

280
00:25:42,654 --> 00:25:44,622
Oh, my head.

281
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,058
[Locke] Welcome back.

282
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:51,552
Hey, John.

283
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:54,622
[exhales]

284
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,730
I found them.

285
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:09,280
After I left, I hiked north.
Back to where we were.

286
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:14,211
Hiked to the beach,
followed the shoreline.

287
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:17,788
A day later, I saw one.

288
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,086
- What did he look like?
- He was dirty.

289
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:25,955
Worn clothing. No shoes. Simple.

290
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:28,791
Just like the rest of them.

291
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:34,834
- Like the rest of them?
- Yeah. His people. The Others.

292
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,967
I followed him back to his camp.

293
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:43,539
They live in tents.
Canvas tents and teepees.

294
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,607
They eat dried fish.
They're worse off than we are.

295
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,549
- How many of them were there?
- I counted 22.

296
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,591
- And the boat...
- I didn't see it.

297
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:56,787
Did you... Did you see Walt?

298
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:00,726
No.

299
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,025
But I know he's there.

300
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:08,835
What about everyone else they took?
Cindy? Did you see any other kids?

301
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:13,240
No. No, no kids.

302
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:17,106
But I think they're in the same place
as my boy.

303
00:27:17,182 --> 00:27:20,879
- They have a hatch.
- How do you know that they...

304
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:24,514
There's a set of metal doors leading
underground. What else could it be?

305
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:26,955
You think that's where
they're keeping the kids?

306
00:27:27,025 --> 00:27:30,688
They keep it guarded 24/7.
Two guards, two guns.

307
00:27:30,762 --> 00:27:34,027
And two guns is all I saw.
They're barely armed.

308
00:27:34,099 --> 00:27:36,897
Most of them are old.
And half of them are women.

309
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,762
I wanted to...

310
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,072
I couldn't save him.

311
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,442
So I came back to tell you.

312
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:57,947
To tell you that we can take them.

313
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:04,590
As soon as I get my strength back,
I will take us back there.

314
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,930
And we are gonna get my boy back.

315
00:28:12,437 --> 00:28:14,405
[machinery bleeps and whirs]

316
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:32,013
You were right.

317
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,826
- Right about what?
- About Henry.

318
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:45,894
What you and Sayid did to him when
you first found him, you were right.

319
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:51,935
I don't like how you did it,
but I shouldn't have gotten in your way.

320
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:59,079
Well, you did what you thought was right
at the time you thought it, Jack.

321
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,987
I just hope the next time you decide
to do something, you include me.

322
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,861
And something tells me
that's gonna be soon.

323
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,165
You heard Michael. We can take them.

324
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,598
Our friend with the beard
told us not to cross the line.

325
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:21,730
These people are liars, John.

326
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:24,867
Why the hell should we take their word
on anything?

327
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:27,608
I couldn't agree more.

328
00:29:28,713 --> 00:29:30,203
So,

329
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:33,350
now what?

330
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,212
[Kate] Where are you going?

331
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,588
To get our guns back from Sawyer.

332
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,820
We're gonna need you
to help convince him.

333
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:47,228
- Who's gonna take care of Michael?
- I'll stay. You guys go ahead.

334
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,333
- You sure?
- Give Sawyer my best.

335
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:53,627
All right. We'll be back soon.

336
00:30:03,115 --> 00:30:05,913
Watch your head. Almost there.

337
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,111
You ever watch The Flintstones?

338
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:11,485
Sure, I used to watch it all the time
when I was in the hospital.

339
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:14,657
When I broke my hip.

340
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:20,090
Did you ever notice how Fred would run
by the same thing over and over again?

341
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:22,190
Third time past this tree.

342
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,367
That's a different tree.

343
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:31,239
[sighs] Hurley, it's OK if you're lost.

344
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:34,107
Dude, I'm not lost. Will you trust me?

345
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,139
We're right about to walk onto the most
excellent secret beach on the island,

346
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:41,879
and... surprise!

347
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:48,886
Hurley, this is our beach.

348
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,792
There's Jin.

349
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:01,001
Hey, I tell you what,
why not have the picnic here?

350
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:04,940
- Come on, give me the blankets.
- Blankets?

351
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:08,937
You don't have any blankets?

352
00:31:10,382 --> 00:31:12,577
How about drinks?

353
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:18,081
OK, I tell you what,
I will handle the blankets,

354
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:22,320
you just track down Rose and Bernard. I
saw them pull wine from the pallet. OK?

355
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:26,463
Oh. Wine.

356
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:29,827
[chuckles] Groovy.

357
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:33,994
Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough
I'll remember where I know you from.

358
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:38,241
Yeah. OK.

359
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,793
[Jack] Sawyer.

360
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,595
- Put the book down.
- It's not a book, it's a manuscript.

361
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:04,829
I'm about to be the first and only guy
to find out "whodunit".

362
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:08,664
I think I got it figured out,
so cool your damn jets

363
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,039
and walk around the coconut trees.
I got ten pages left.

364
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,600
Hey!

365
00:32:14,412 --> 00:32:16,403
Want to figure it out?

366
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:20,910
Jeez!

367
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,245
What the hell is your problem, Doc?

368
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:26,381
It's time to give us the guns back.

369
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,319
- You burn the ending of my book...
- Where are they, James?

370
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,886
- You too, Brutus?
- Just take us there. All right?

371
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,932
Quit playing around.

372
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,230
What? You bring her along
for a sympathy vote?

373
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:41,204
She ain't in my head, Doc, so why don't
you two just go play in the jungle?

374
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:44,237
Take us to the guns. Now.

375
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:52,849
Oh, that bitch.

376
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:56,820
She stole my damn gun. Ana Lucia.

377
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:01,224
- Why would she need a gun?
- [Sawyer] Son of a bitch!

378
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,619
Jack.

379
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:11,431
I need to tell you something.

380
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:22,846
Pick it up.

381
00:33:28,953 --> 00:33:31,046
Cut yourself loose.

382
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,323
What?

383
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,359
Just do it.

384
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:39,257
Why?

385
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:42,490
You know why.

386
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,659
He kept saying you were misunderstood.

387
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:10,854
What are you talking about?

388
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,427
Goodwin.

389
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,493
Yes. He told us all about you, Ana.

390
00:34:18,636 --> 00:34:22,072
How he thought you were worthy,
that he could change you.

391
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,603
But he was wrong.

392
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,685
And it cost him his life.

393
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:45,520
He was gonna kill me.

394
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,232
Was he?

395
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,340
Are you done?

396
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:07,409
Yes, Ana. I'm done.

397
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:18,288
So, this is it, huh?

398
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:23,524
Yes, Henry. This is it.

399
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:35,336
I want you to listen to me, OK?
Because I am asking you a favor.

400
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:39,008
Chrissy, I'm standing
in front of you in the same suit

401
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:42,519
that I'm wearing to my father's funeral
and I'm asking you a favor.

402
00:35:42,587 --> 00:35:45,215
In 1 6 hours I need to land at LAX.

403
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:49,987
I need that coffin to clear Customs
because there will be a hearse waiting.

404
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:55,528
And I need that hearse to take me and
that coffin to a cemetery. Why, Chrissy?

405
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,161
Why can't I just bring him to a funeral
home and make all the arrangements?

406
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:01,865
Why can't I really take my time with it?
Because...

407
00:36:02,674 --> 00:36:04,642
Because I need it to be done.

408
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,901
I need it to be over.

409
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:14,311
I just... I need to bury my father.

410
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:16,410
[cell phone keys bleep]

411
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:18,654
[ringing]

412
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,917
[whoosh of airplane engines]

413
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:27,754
That was an airplane.

414
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,934
No, I'm not at work. I'm in Sydney.

415
00:36:32,303 --> 00:36:34,464
That's right. Australia.

416
00:36:37,909 --> 00:36:39,069
I...

417
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:43,010
I don't know, l...

418
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:52,049
I made a mistake, Mom.

419
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:58,585
You knew, so I got as far away
from you as I could.

420
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:06,734
But now...

421
00:37:08,973 --> 00:37:11,134
I wanna come home, Mommy.

422
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:17,972
So come home.

423
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:23,176
[breathes in and out sharply]

424
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,186
I'm on Oceanic Flight 81 5.

425
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:32,753
I'll be there when you land, mija.

426
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,679
Where is everybody?

427
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,951
What you said got them worked up.

428
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:00,752
They went to get all the guns back
from Sawyer.

429
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,816
Sawyer?

430
00:38:05,096 --> 00:38:07,257
Sawyer has all the guns?

431
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,167
Long story.

432
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,407
At least he didn't get that one.

433
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:19,643
Yeah.

434
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:22,775
Too bad I can't use it.

435
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:28,516
- Use it on what?
- We caught one of them.

436
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:30,417
The Others.

437
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:33,882
He's locked up in there.

438
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,658
- How long has he...
- Over a week.

439
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:42,456
And you're, what, taking care of him?

440
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,995
He tried to kill me today.

441
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:52,269
So I wanted him dead.

442
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:06,053
I couldn't do it.

443
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,258
I couldn't even kill him.

444
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,201
I looked at him, and he...

445
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:27,634
I can't do this anymore.

446
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:42,819
Then let me do it.

447
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,123
They're animals.

448
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:54,533
I've seen these people
and they are animals.

449
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:59,708
They took my son. Right out of my hands.
They took my son, and...

450
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,616
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll kill him.

451
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:13,522
'Cause that's what they'd do.

452
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,494
What's the combination?

453
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:30,303
1 8 right.

454
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,102
1 left.

455
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:37,181
31 right.

456
00:40:55,032 --> 00:40:56,829
I'm sorry.

457
00:40:58,336 --> 00:40:59,769
For what?

458
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,757
- Michael?
- [gasps]
