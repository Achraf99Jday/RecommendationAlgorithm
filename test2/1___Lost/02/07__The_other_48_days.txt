1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,319
You gotta help me!

2
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,917
Emma! My sister! My sister!

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,673
Emma! Emma!

4
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,271
I'll be right back.

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,555
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.

6
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,631
Come with me.

7
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,118
Don't worry, she will be fine.

8
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,077
Good. Let it out. You OK?

9
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,473
Where's my mom?

10
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,870
I don't know.

11
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,679
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.

12
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,716
Pam!

13
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,758
Pam! Anybody seen my wife?

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,910
We're not there yet.

15
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,357
I promise,
we're gonna get you home soon, OK?

16
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,631
Excuse me.

17
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,390
Would you look after the children?

18
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,355
There is something I have to do.

19
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,071
OK.

20
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,678
Stay with this nice woman.

21
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,149
I'll be back in a minute.

22
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,353
My leg! My leg!

23
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,635
Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?

24
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,840
Nah, it's not that bad. I broke my leg
skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.

25
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,870
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.

26
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,714
I went off this mogul, lost my edge,
and... bam!

27
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,797
Snapped my left leg.

28
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,269
Now, that... that was bad.

29
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,716
You a doctor?

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,439
Year of med school before I dropped out.

31
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,795
I'm a clinical psychologist.

32
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,838
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?

33
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,914
No.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,035
Help!

35
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,634
Hey! I need some help!

36
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,757
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!

37
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,870
Help! Help me!

38
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,269
Please, help me!

39
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,515
Help!

40
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,315
Help!

41
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,991
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...

44
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,431
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt
and grab the branch next to you.

45
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,679
Is he dead? I think he's dead!

46
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,991
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No. I need you to focus, Bernard.

47
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,516
Unbuckle your seat belt.

48
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,996
Now, grab the branch next to you.

49
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,709
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.

50
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,995
Come on, you can do it.

51
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,754
Bernard!

52
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,993
All right, hold on tight, OK?

53
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,071
I'm coming up to get you.

54
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,754
- Does anybody have any water?
- No. Not here.

55
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,236
Couldn't find any matches?

56
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,552
Dry ones? You can ask around,
but I couldn't find any.

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,475
It's gonna be dark soon. Gonna get a
signal fire started so they can find us.

58
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,189
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.

59
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,239
- I'm in the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?

60
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,518
I'm just happy somebody your age
actually knows what it is.

61
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,318
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.

62
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,994
I'm Ana Lucia.

63
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,353
I heard that you were the one who
pulled the dead bodies out of the water.

64
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,074
Yes.

65
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,159
Were any of them African-American?

66
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,675
No.

67
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,476
It's my wife.

68
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,834
I can't find her.

69
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,874
I will pray for her.

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,078
Where the hell are the rescue planes?

71
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,310
I will pray for them, too.

72
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,631
What was that?

73
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,198
Libby, watch the kids.

74
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,678
Over here.

75
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,592
It's all right. We'll be OK.

76
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,918
What happened?

77
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,799
No wallets...

78
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,917
...no cell phone...

79
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,911
...no keys, nothing.

80
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,708
Hey.

81
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,075
Are you OK?

82
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,029
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.

83
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,954
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy,
and the German who was helping us.

84
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,873
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?

85
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,518
No, I didn't see anything.

86
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,473
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

87
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,233
But they're out here in the jungle
with no shoes,

88
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,676
nothing in their pockets,
no labels on their clothes.

89
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,838
These people were here before us.

90
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,631
We need to get off the beach.

91
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,792
We need to find a safer place.

92
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,713
We've got kids
and people who are seriously hurt.

93
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,677
Where are we gonna go?

94
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,996
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?

95
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,197
How are we all gonna get rescued
if we're off the beach?

96
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,956
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites. The black box.

97
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,270
We don't need a fire
for them to find us.

98
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,351
Yes, we do.

99
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,749
Before the crash,
the pilot said we'd lost communication.

100
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,558
We were turning back.

101
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,712
We were flying for two hours
in the wrong direction.

102
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,000
They don't know where to look.

103
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,632
It's Donald.

104
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,951
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.

105
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,952
He'll be the fourth to go.

106
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,639
What are we supposed to do about that?

107
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,918
No, come here! Come on!
Grab it! Grab it! Over here!

108
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,956
Come on! Over here!

109
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,313
I got it! I got it! Oh, no!
I got it! All right...

110
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,630
I got it! I got it! I got it...

111
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,030
Would you like some chicken?

112
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,116
You haven't said a word in a week.

113
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,840
Why aren't you talking?

114
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,195
Hey.

115
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,430
It wasn't your fault, you know.

116
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,839
You were just defending yourself.

117
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,309
- That'll work.
- Yeah...

118
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,675
I heard a pig or something out there.

119
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,718
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.

120
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,312
Give it to me.

121
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,918
What?

122
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,195
Where were you?

123
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,430
I had to go to the bathroom.

124
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,317
We have a system for that.

125
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,356
We go in pairs.

126
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,997
Yeah, sorry.

127
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,594
Behind you! Behind you!

128
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,070
- Help us! Please!
- The kids! They took the kids!

129
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,957
Stop!

130
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,434
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!

131
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,795
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.

132
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,269
Which way did they go?

133
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,749
Which way did they go?

134
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,750
Wake up! Wake up! Who are you?

135
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,630
- Talk to me! Wake up!
- She's dead! She's dead.

136
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,151
What are you doing?

137
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,070
Is that a knife?

138
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,399
What is that?

139
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,875
It's a list.

140
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,192
A list of what?

141
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,033
Nine... of us.

142
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,113
Nothing?

143
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,716
They drag nine people
into the jungle, the kids...

144
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,950
...and there's no sign of them?

145
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,835
Now's not a good time to talk?

146
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,235
What needs to happen
to make you say something?

147
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,470
Hey! Calm down, let's figure this out.

148
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,711
"Calm down, let's figure this out"?

149
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,237
Here are the names of every single
person they took, all nine of them.

150
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,754
What they were wearing,
what they look like.

151
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,832
One of them had a list of us.

152
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,593
They coulda got our names
from the people they took.

153
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,231
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.

154
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,630
You were gone for two hours yesterday.

155
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,234
- What?
- Where were you?

156
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,835
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!

157
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,388
We're all scared.

158
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,393
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.

159
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,350
He's right. Why would they try to
infiltrate us? Now, that's crazy.

160
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,070
Well, whoever they are, they know we
are here. We need to leave this beach.

161
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,431
You said we needed
to keep the signal fire burning.

162
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,952
I think it's time we let it go out.

163
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,437
Five minutes.

164
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,271
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here. Five minutes.

165
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,432
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.

166
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,876
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs,
lots of fruit trees,

167
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,599
right here looks pretty good to me.

168
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,035
Fine. OK.

169
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,469
This'll work.

170
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,152
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,357
Back at the beach,
the night they came back,

172
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,309
you said that Nathan was gone
for two hours, that he was missing.

173
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,232
He creeps me out, Ana.

174
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,558
You really think it's possible
that one of us is...

175
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,237
one of them?

176
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,993
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?

177
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,794
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah. Give me another stick.

178
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,118
Hey, Ana.

179
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,953
Ana!

180
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,870
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.

181
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,830
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!

182
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,070
You let me out, or I'll...

183
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,993
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.

184
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,036
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.

185
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,031
I didn't see him once. Not once.

186
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,509
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.

187
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,434
I'm pretty good with faces,
of the passengers. I did not see him.

188
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,990
- You're not all serious
- He never talks about himself. Nathan.

189
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,799
Every time I ask him anything,
he just dodges.

190
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,599
If he were one of them,
why would he still be here?

191
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,194
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

192
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,629
Will you let me out? Ana?

193
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,990
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!

194
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,514
I didn't do anything.

195
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,233
Let me out!

196
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,876
Where are the kids?

197
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,714
Where are the kids?

198
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,151
Where you from, Nathan?

199
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,160
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?

200
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,196
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?

201
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,271
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.

202
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,954
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.

203
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,477
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?

204
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,120
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?

205
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,236
I don't remember seeing you.

206
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,357
That's because you weren't on it.

207
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,598
Where are the kids, Nathan?

208
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,156
Where are the kids?

209
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,920
You're not talking to me anymore?

210
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,229
What's that behind you?

211
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,672
Get up.

212
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,789
I said, get up!

213
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,792
- Who gave him food?
- What?

214
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,791
I'm trying to find out what they did,

215
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,077
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.

216
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,835
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.

217
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:11,038
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach
where they could pick us off one by one?

218
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,872
His. Nathan's.

219
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
Well, they haven't come
since we put him in there.

220
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,557
Who did it?

221
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,717
You?

222
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,794
I'm worried about you, Ana.

223
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
You've had him down there four days.

224
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,518
I promised that little girl that
I would get her back home to her mom.

225
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,756
Do you have any kids, Ana?

226
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,998
No.

227
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,550
We should let him go.

228
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,879
We're not savages.

229
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,111
If I were a savage
I would have cut off his finger already.

230
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,158
That's tomorrow.

231
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,672
Grab the rope. I'll pull you up.

232
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,790
Ana Lucia's... I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.

233
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,678
You need to get away from here.

234
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,194
There's some fruit in there,
now just go.

235
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,553
- Which way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.

236
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,228
Morning.

237
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,834
Morning.

238
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,874
- Ana Lucia! He's gone!
- What?

239
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,110
He's gone! Nathan's gone!

240
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,589
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.

241
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,915
What is it?

242
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,353
I don't know.

243
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,079
Some sort of bunker.

244
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,276
Do you think it's theirs?

245
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,235
What are you doing?

246
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,151
What is this place?

247
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,630
Looks like
some sort of storage facility.

248
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,318
Hey, come over here.

249
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,990
What was that? Get it.

250
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,831
What else is in here?

251
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,189
It's a glass eye.

252
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,991
Look at this.

253
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,073
It's a radio.

254
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,913
Hello?

255
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,114
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

256
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,398
The hills are blocking it. If we want a
signal, we need to get to higher ground.

257
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,950
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.

258
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,234
No, you stay here.

259
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,357
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.

260
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,590
We can make it back
in a couple of hours.

261
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,432
Let's go.

262
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,920
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?

263
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,154
Them. Don't you ever wonder
why they attack us?

264
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,516
Maybe they're not attacking us.

265
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,597
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle
every now and then.

266
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,114
No real harm done.

267
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,350
Good point.

268
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,914
Why do you think they take some of us
and not the others?

269
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,594
That first night
they took the strongest of us,

270
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,399
our quiet friend, three other guys.

271
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:23,714
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.

272
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,189
They didn't take you.

273
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,594
Guess they changed their plan
after two of them got killed.

274
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,829
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

275
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,311
Can I have the knife?

276
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,998
Thank you.

277
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,673
Where do you think they got it?

278
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,955
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.

279
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,508
How did they get an army knife?

280
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,231
- Sorry?
- The knife. It's US military.

281
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,395
Here...

282
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,472
I'll show you.

283
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,231
You see the tang stamp?

284
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,270
This knife's probably 20 years old.

285
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,920
You don't see these anymore.

286
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,993
Yet, here it is, on this island.

287
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,471
Weird, huh?

288
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,870
Can I ask you something?

289
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,396
Sure, Ana.

290
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,075
When you ran out of the jungle,
the day of the crash...

291
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,628
...how did you find Bernard
up in the tree?

292
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,629
I heard him shouting from the beach.

293
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,276
From the beach?

294
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,874
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?

295
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,435
Did he see you out there?

296
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,556
Is that why you pretended
to be one of us?

297
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,799
You ran out of the jungle
ten minutes after the crash.

298
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,598
You weren't wet.

299
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,158
You were never even in the ocean.

300
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,273
Where are they?

301
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,396
Your friends?

302
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,197
Nathan... what did you...

303
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,989
If you had cut off his finger and
he still told you he was on the plane,

304
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,119
I think maybe you would have started
to believe you had the wrong guy.

305
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,599
Did you kill him?

306
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,114
Nathan was not a good person.

307
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,871
That's why he wasn't on the list.

308
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,471
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?

309
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,596
The children are fine.

310
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,194
They're better off now.

311
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,515
Where's Goodwin?

312
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,835
We're safe here now.

313
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,390
Why are you wasting time
with that thing? There's no signal.

314
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,634
I only turn it on a couple minutes
a day. It really doesn't...

315
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,597
<i>Hello? Hello? Anybody out there?</i>
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

316
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,158
- Is there someone there?
- <i>Hello! Hello!</i>

317
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,675
- Who is that?
- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

318
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,637
Repeat your transmission.

319
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,589
<i>Hello! We're survivors of the crash</i>
<i>of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!</i>

320
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,719
We're the survivors of flight 815!
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?

321
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,995
It's them.

322
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,713
It's them.

323
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,069
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.

324
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,071
No, he said "flight 815".

325
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,199
They know our flight number because
Goodwin knew our flight number.

326
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,798
- What if there are survivors out there?
- There are no survivors.

327
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,274
This is our life now.

328
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,271
Get used to it.

329
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,995
What are you looking at?

330
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,830
It's going to be OK.

331
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,950
What, you're talking now?

332
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,835
It's been 40 days.

333
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,359
You been waiting 40 days to talk?

334
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,279
You waited 40 days to cry.

335
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,234
Libby.

336
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,760
- Turn him over.
- Is he alive?

337
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,270
Get Ana Lucia! Quick!

338
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,556
Who are you?

339
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,954
Where are you from?

340
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,917
- He doesn't speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.

341
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,470
- We found him in the water.
- He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.

342
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,551
I'm not sure that he's a threat.

343
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,429
He's running!

344
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,752
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

345
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,114
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

346
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,273
Others! Others! Others! Others!
Others...

347
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,793
Others...

348
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,629
- Hit me.
- Hit you?

349
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,553
You think they're OK?

350
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,358
Let's find out.

351
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,793
Hit me.

352
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,837
- Cindy?
- Did they take her?

353
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,512
Cindy!

354
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,232
What was that?
