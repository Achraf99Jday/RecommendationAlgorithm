00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,998
<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,630
- Good luck.
- Same to you.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,268
- We have to fire the flare.
- It doesn't make...

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,989
Look, are you gonna give me the damn
gun, or am I gonna have to take it?

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,078
Please, God!

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,274
It's coming back! It's coming back!

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,032
- We're gonna have to take the boy.
- What? What did you say?

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,634
The boy. We're gonna have to take him.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,549
Hey! Hey! What...

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,517
Dad!

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,351
Dad! Help me!

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,476
- Walt!
- Help me, Dad!

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,593
No, no, no...

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,148
Stop it! Stop it! We can't!

15
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,996
Locke found a... a hatch in the ground.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,755
The sun comes up in three hours
and we're all gonna see that happen.

17
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,229
We're gonna stay here tonight, OK?
Together.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,520
- John, what are you doing?
- I'm going in.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,831
Locke's going into that thing,
whether you like it or not.

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,388
I'm going to the hatch.

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,119
- Live together, die alone, right?
- Right.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,034
John!
I think there's something down here!

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,477
Dad, please! Dad!

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,471
Walt!

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,357
Oh, no!

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,078
Walt! Walt!

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,318
- Walt!
- Mike!

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,398
Sawyer!

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,790
- Jin!
- Michael! On fire!

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,629
- Michael!
- Walt!

31
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,274
Mike!

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,479
Walt! Walt!

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,956
Hang on, Mike!

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,753
Hang on, Mike!

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,519
- Hang on!
- Walt!

36
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,829
Mike.

37
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,349
Mike.

38
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,471
Mike! Mike!

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,318
Kate!

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,034
Mike!

41
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,235
- Where's Walt?
- I don't know.

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,598
Walt!

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,110
How'd you hurt your leg?

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,033
- Got hit by a car.
- Ow.

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,553
Yeah.

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,393
So, this is the paperwork
your ex-wife sent over...

49
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,917
She's not my ex-wife, man.
She's just Walt's mother.

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,954
She... Susan, she just got a job
in Rome with her boyfriend.

51
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,917
They want to take Walt with them.

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,151
Don't worry, I'm gonna take
real good care of you, Mr Dylan.

53
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,071
Dawson.

54
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,469
Right. Sorry. Dawson.

55
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,356
So this boyfriend,
this is this guy Brian Porter?

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,158
Yeah. Why? What's it say?

57
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,872
It seems that Susan wants you to
relinquish your rights as Walt's father

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,953
- so that Mr Porter can adopt him.
- She wants me to sign my son away?

59
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,157
It's the only way they can proceed
with the adoption, yeah.

60
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,276
Listen, if you sign this document,

61
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,069
legally he'll be no different than
any other kid you pass on the street.

62
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,994
You'd be giving up your paternal rights.
All of them.

63
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,196
So then, can I stop her from going?

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,475
Well,
I guess we could file an injunction

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,918
- so she couldn't leave the city, but...
- Yeah, that. That. I want to do that.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,433
Right.

67
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,319
Mr Dawson,

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,836
the fact that you came in through
these doors tells me something.

69
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,959
It tells me that I'm the best
that you can afford.

70
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,838
If we go forward with this,
it's gonna take money.

71
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,196
A lot of it. Even at my rates.

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,432
This is David and Goliath,
so I gotta ask you,

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,511
are you sure you wanna do this?

74
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,115
They're not taking my son away.

75
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,872
Walt!

76
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,951
- Mike! You should save your energy.
- They took my son!

77
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,589
Yeah, I saw. Onto a boat, which means
he's not in shouting distance!

78
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,910
- You don't know that!
- I got a good sense.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,797
Even if he was,
there's nothing you can do.

80
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,792
If he can hear me, he knows I'm alive,

81
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,190
that I'm coming for him,
that I'm going to get him back!

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,272
Right now, all I got is that
maybe my son can hear me...

83
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,999
- Does that make any sense to you?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,793
Walt!

85
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,953
Kate!

86
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,197
Kate.

87
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,113
- John?
- Easy, easy, easy.

88
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,792
Behind you.

89
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,476
Are you him?

90
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,673
Are you him?

91
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,317
Jin!

92
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,191
Jin!

93
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,675
I thought we had to save our energy.

94
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,793
Yeah, well,
Jin's still out there in the water,

95
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,077
so if it's OK by you
I'm gonna keep shoutin' awhile.

96
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
- Feeling guilty.
- What?

97
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,956
You made me fire that flare.

98
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,115
I made you fire...

99
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,431
What, this is my fault?

100
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,590
They took my son.

101
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,116
They found us, took Walt,
because you made me fire the flare.

102
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,431
Well, at least Walt is on a boat.
Probably wrapped in a blanket

103
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,557
- with a cup of cocoa while we're on...
- Get off my raft.

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,073
- What?
- Get...

105
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,398
What the hell was that?

106
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,910
I see you managed to hold on
to your best friend, there.

107
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,752
Thing ain't gonna work anyway.

108
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,876
- It'll work.
- You were underwater.

109
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,589
What do you know about guns anyway,
Hoss? lt'll work.

110
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,430
If the bullets are dry,
the powder's dry. If the powder's...

111
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,589
What the hell is that?

112
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,757
It's a shark.

113
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,433
It's only a shark.

114
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,716
"It's only a shark"? That's supposed
to make me feel better?

115
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,395
Well, I guess I know why the shark
is hanging around. Your shoulder.

116
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,994
Oh, well, I'll just stop bleeding then.

117
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,588
You suddenly forget what happened?
Why I got shot?

118
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,478
- What?
- How about a little gratitude here?

119
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
I mean, how about "Thank you"?

120
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,159
Thank you? For what?
For you trying to save your own ass?

121
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,239
You want me off this raft? You got it!

122
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,234
I was trying to save your damn kid.

123
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,199
Let's talk about Walt, shall we,
Mr Dawson?

124
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,990
Sure. OK.

125
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,674
When was the last time
you actually saw your son?

126
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,077
- About a year ago.
- It was fourteen months, actually.

127
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,197
- Is that a question, Lizzy?
- Why is that, Mr Dawson?

128
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,671
- Why so long?
- Susan took him to Amsterdam. For work.

129
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,513
- You didn't have a problem with that?
- Excuse me?

130
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,195
Well, since she's now going to Rome
and you're filing an injunction,

131
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,273
- it just seems a little inconsistent.
- Incon... No.

132
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,237
- No, no, no, no, no...
- Don't...

133
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,675
She took him, though.
I didn't want her to go.

134
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,070
- You said there was nothing I could do.
- And you didn't, did you?

135
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,675
- He's not gonna answer that.
- Because there is no answer.

136
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,910
You were in an accident recently?

137
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,715
Yeah.

138
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,713
You had several surgeries,
spent weeks in a private hospital room,

139
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,950
extensive rehabilitation.

140
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,310
- Who paid for all that, Mr Dawson?
- I didn't ask you for anything.

141
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,678
Could the record reflect Mr Dawson
acknowledged Miss Lloyd paid his bills?

142
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,479
Susan, tell them
that I didn't ask you...

143
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,711
Please don't address my client directly.

144
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,633
Do you know what Walt's
first words were, Mr Dawson?

145
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,234
- I'm sorry, what?
- His first words.

146
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,595
Do you know what they were?

147
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,033
I...

148
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,874
No. I... I wasn't there.

149
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,234
Do you know what his favourite food is?

150
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,395
- Do you...
- No.

151
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,550
OK. This is unnecessary...

152
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,308
No.

153
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,313
Well, for someone who wants
to retain his paternal rights so badly,

154
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,517
you don't seem to know much
about your son, Mr Dawson.

155
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,591
I'm his father.

156
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,355
I'm sorry, could you say that louder,
please? Just for the record?

157
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,156
I'm his father.

158
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,315
Are you crazy? You gonna take
the bullet out with your bare hands?

159
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,840
You got a better idea?

160
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,911
Then go to hell.

161
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,635
Never gonna be able to do it
by yourself.

162
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,030
- I thought we parted ways.
- We're caught in the same current.

163
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,315
He's still talking.

164
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,555
Come on...

165
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,349
You got a Band-Aid?

166
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,955
Are you? Are you him?

167
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,039
Yes.

168
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,512
Yes, I am.

169
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,153
I can't believe it. You're finally here.

170
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,591
Well, here I am.

171
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,031
Who's she?

172
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,555
She's with me.

173
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,638
What did one snowman
say to the other snowman?

174
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

175
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,079
Get rid of the knife. You're not him!

176
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,393
- We didn't come here to hurt you.
- Yeah? Then why did you come?

177
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,948
We were in a plane crash.

178
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,759
Were you now? And when was that?

179
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,955
44 days ago.

180
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,508
44 days?

181
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,273
Move.

182
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,638
- How long have you been down here?
- Shut it.

183
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,075
Tie him up.

184
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,957
Do it!

185
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,673
Wait, wait, you're tying up
the wrong person.

186
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,038
- How's that, brother?
- It's pointless to tie me up,

187
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,351
I'm not dangerous.
But her? She's a fugitive.

188
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,676
What does that make you, then, brother?

189
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,594
I'm a regional collections manager
for a cardboard manufacturer.

190
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,557
Boxes, primarily.

191
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,795
All right then, Box Man. Tie her up.

192
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,828
- Don't you dare touch...
- Hey!

193
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,797
You be a good girl, right?

194
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,636
- What do you think you're doing?
- What's best for all of us.

195
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,597
Right, bring her here.

196
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,318
Hey, John...

197
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,517
- Hey, wait! Hey!
- Shut it.

198
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,113
Wait!

199
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,638
You're kiddin', right?
You're going back?

200
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,308
- Yeah.
- What about all that stuff you said

201
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,551
about waiting until morning
and watching the sun rise?

202
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,835
I changed my mind.

203
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,310
What do you suppose all that's about?

204
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,914
I reckon Jack's
going to do something heroic.

205
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,954
What?

206
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,309
You always try to be funny when
you don't want to answer a question.

207
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,991
"Try" to be funny?

208
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,871
What's this?

209
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,479
- I found it in the jungle.
- You found it?

210
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,869
Yeah. Be careful...

211
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,952
Be careful with it.
Here, hey, take Aaron.

212
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,311
Come here. There you go.

213
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,712
You gotta be careful with it, you know,
it's the Virgin Mary. She's holy.

214
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,995
I didn't realise you were so religious.

215
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,995
I'm not. It's just, you know,
it might come in handy.

216
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,710
Be a nice thing to have around.

217
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,715
It wasn't the flare.

218
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,749
I said it wasn't the flare.

219
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,868
Those people that did this...

220
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,395
At first I thought they were fishermen
or pirates or something.

221
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,234
Then I got a good look at their boat.

222
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,959
You know anything about boats, Mike?

223
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,993
Boat like that wasn't built
for the open ocean.

224
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,992
Water's coming over the side
the first little squall.

225
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,310
Maybe got a range of a hundred miles.

226
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,428
Nope. A boat like that had to have
left port from somewhere close.

227
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,511
Like the island.

228
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,229
French chick said the Others
were coming for the kid.

229
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,031
I think they came, Mike.

230
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,868
- What?
- He's the one they wanted,

231
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,030
why I got a bullet in my shoulder.

232
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,157
Hell, Bluebeard blew us up
because they wanted your kid.

233
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,437
- You saying this is my fault?
- Yeah. That's what I'm sayin'.

234
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,353
They took him because of you.
They were sailing away!

235
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,591
They found us because
they were looking for us! For Walt!

236
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,593
- Don't ever say his name again, ever!
- What you gonna do? Splash me?

237
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,310
- Look. I know...
- Shut up!

238
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,396
Don't even...

239
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,349
You have no idea what it's like
to care for somebody else.

240
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,953
Hi.

241
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,871
- Where are your lawyers?
- I told them I wanted to talk.

242
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,155
Just you and me.

243
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,915
- But if you want yours, I understand.
- No. It's OK.

244
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,756
I think you're gonna win.

245
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,392
Excuse me?

246
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,156
In court. I think you're going to keep
me from leaving the country with Walt.

247
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,949
But I just have to ask you why.

248
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,748
- Why what?
- Why are you doing this?

249
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,195
- He's my son.
- Since when, Michael?

250
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,317
Look, I know you don't care
about what's best for me,

251
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,119
but in Rome
I'll be a senior partner at the firm.

252
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,668
I'll be able to give Walt
anything he needs.

253
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,797
You're still on disability, Michael.
You can't work.

254
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,871
You're about to be evicted.

255
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,838
- Got your lawyers checking up on me?
- Of course I did.

256
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,276
Just like you had your lawyers check up
on me. Nobody's winning.

257
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,555
Then stop.

258
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,953
Michael, the first thing you need to do
is take care of yourself.

259
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,755
You need to get healthy, you need to get
back on your feet financially

260
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,070
so you can get back
to pursuing your art.

261
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,113
You have rare talent as an artist,
Michael.

262
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,509
But how are you going to do that,
any of that,

263
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,550
and still be a part of Walt's life?

264
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,830
I'll do it by doing it.

265
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,910
Walt is my responsibility too.

266
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,830
Then let him go.

267
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,118
Because it's not about you or me.
It's about him.

268
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,075
I don't want to go to court, Michael.

269
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,715
So please, just...

270
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,955
let him go.

271
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,954
The pilot said
we had lost radio contact,

272
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,112
but by then we were already
a thousand miles off course.

273
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,668
Any search teams
would've given up weeks ago.

274
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,479
So you were travelling
from Sydney to Los Angeles?

275
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,709
Yes.

276
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,551
So the world is still out there?

277
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,074
Yeah, as far as I know.

278
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,830
Could you tell me your name?

279
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,911
My name?

280
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,356
My name is Desmond.

281
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,235
Desmond, I'm John.

282
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,468
You should know
the gun is really unnecessary.

283
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,473
Oh yeah? So I should just hand it
over to you then, should I?

284
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,515
How many of you are there?

285
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,559
43. But four sailed out
this morning on a raft.

286
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,198
A raft?

287
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,711
That simulated sunlight,
is that because you never leave?

288
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,189
Is there another way out?

289
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,475
How many of your group have gotten sick?

290
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,599
- Sick?
- Sick. As in ill. As in dead.

291
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,319
Is that why it says "Quarantine"
on the hatch?

292
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,393
- Answer the question!
- No one has... No one, no one is sick.

293
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,911
Get up.

294
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,595
Move.

295
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,875
Stand right there.

296
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,754
Do you know how to use this, Box Man?

297
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,991
- Haven't seen one of those in 20 years.
- Do you know how?

298
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,308
- Yes.
- Sit.

299
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,837
Right, now listen carefully.

300
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,708
Type in exactly what I tell you.
Understand? Exactly. Nothing else.

301
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,078
4... 8... 15...

302
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,874
- Do you hear that?
- What?

303
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,870
What'd you just put in?
What number did you just put in?

304
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,190
- 15.
- Right. 16...

305
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,314
23... 42...

306
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,191
Now press "Execute."

307
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,316
- What's gonna happen?
- Just push it.

308
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,195
Kate!

309
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,797
- Locke!
- Who the hell is that?

310
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,351
That would be Jack.

311
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,352
Who is he?

312
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,512
His name is Jack. He's our doctor.

313
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,271
What's he doing here?

314
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,432
To be honest with you,
I'm a little surprised to see him.

315
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,110
Your doctor has a gun, brother.

316
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,952
Move.

317
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,757
Make one sound and I'll shoot.
Move!

318
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,149
Jack! Jack!

319
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,519
Jack!

320
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,314
I wouldn't do that, Jack.

321
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,278
- Where's Kate? What the hell did you...
- Move and I kill him.

322
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,156
- Put the gun down.
- Where's Kate?

323
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,958
- Jack, it's OK.
- I said drop it!

324
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,792
- Where's Kate?
- She's fine. Just put down...

325
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,472
I'm not putting down anything...

326
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,793
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

327
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,993
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke? Is this your destiny?

328
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,833
- "All roads lead here"?
- Calm down.

329
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,868
Lower your gun, or I'll blow
his damned head off, brother.

330
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,432
You!

331
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,797
What the hell is that?

332
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,269
It's part of the raft,
one of the pontoons.

333
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,149
Stop paddling.

334
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,677
Hey, stop it! You're putting a strain on
the vines. It's going to break us up.

335
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,116
Damn it, you're gonna sink us!

336
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,754
Sawyer!

337
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,870
- Climb up!
- I do and we both sink.

338
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,997
I'm going for the pontoon.

339
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,671
Don't be an idiot.

340
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,516
You see that toothy son of a bitch,
you aim and squeeze. Got it?

341
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,431
Got it.

342
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,038
Come on! Come on, come on!

343
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,394
Sawyer!

344
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,157
Sawyer!

345
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,275
Gimme your hand!

346
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,070
There he is. Do you see him?

347
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,149
Hi.

348
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,790
- Hey.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

349
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,839
Packing's been a disaster and the plane
leaves first thing in the morning.

350
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,309
Sure. No problem.

351
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,230
Hey, do you wanna say hi, Walt?

352
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,476
Hi, Walt. I'm...

353
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,237
I'm...

354
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,598
Hey, this is for you, man.
He like bears?

355
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,118
Yes. Sure. He's just really shy.

356
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,438
Hey, little man.

357
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,719
Well, I guess I can't call you that,
I mean, because look how big you are.

358
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,673
So, you and I, we're not gonna
see each other for a while, Walt.

359
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,919
But you are gonna have a great life.

360
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,193
I know your mommy, she's going
to take real good care of you.

361
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,633
And Brian is gonna take good care
of you, too.

362
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,110
But you know what?

363
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,115
I just want you to know
that no matter where you go, I...

364
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,671
That your daddy...

365
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,835
Yeah, your daddy,
he loves you very, very much.

366
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,674
And I always will.

367
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,715
Always. OK?

368
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,230
- I'm sorry, he's...
- No. It's OK.

369
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,558
It's OK.

370
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,759
Hey, here.

371
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,031
Just, you know...

372
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,988
Let him know it's from me sometime, OK?

373
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,232
OK.

374
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,391
Goodbye, Michael.

375
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,710
Yeah. Bye.

376
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,310
You all right, Mike?

377
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,031
It's my fault.

378
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,277
What?

379
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,158
I never should have brought him
on the raft.

380
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,389
I'm gonna get him back.

381
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,436
I'm gonna get back my son.

382
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,111
How about that?

383
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,355
Current brought us back.

384
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,431
We're home.

385
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,519
Jin?

386
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,516
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

387
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,194
- Others! Others!
- What?

388
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,475
- Others! Others!
- What?

389
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,118
Others.
