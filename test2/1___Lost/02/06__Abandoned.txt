<i>Previously on</i> Lost:

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,269
Boone, what do you see?

3
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,636
All right, all of you, get up.

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,950
We're moving out.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,717
- Moving out where?
- Back to where you came from.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,470
- Your buddy ran off into the jungle.
- Michael... he just left.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,198
Walt!

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,431
What are we supposed to do?
Wait for him?

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,559
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to help him find his friend.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,750
You thirsty, dog?

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,229
Yeah, you're always thirsty, aren't you?

12
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,790
So, drink.

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,029
Come on.

14
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,680
Gather your things.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,955
Where are we going?

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,712
Sayid?

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,116
- Right over here.
- Where are we going?

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,790
What do you think?

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,792
Does it have an inside?

20
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,917
- When did you do this?
- It's all yours.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,632
Thank you.

22
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,675
You are quite welcome.

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,111
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,233
You need to carry that all the time?

25
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,551
I only carry it
because I have someone to protect.

26
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,794
Ana, it's gotta be over an hour.

27
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,431
- Shouldn't we start moving again?
- Let them rest a little while longer.

28
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,431
Yeah, but what if they come?

29
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,598
- She's lost.
- I am not lost.

30
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,434
Then tell me, Ponce de LeÃ³n,
which way are we supposed to go?

31
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,029
All right then, genius,
which way would you go?

32
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,588
Hey, I'm with you.

33
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,468
Sit tight and wait for Mr Eko
to show up and guide us.

34
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,072
If your friend didn't run off, Eko
would still be here now, wouldn't he?

35
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,835
You sure didn't have any problem
leaving him behind, though, huh?

36
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,958
Mike only cares about himself
and his kid.

37
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,315
Neither's got squat to do with me.

38
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,630
Glad you feel that way.

39
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,949
Didn't expect to see you again.

40
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,790
Yeah, yeah, Chewie, I know.

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,713
My arm's about to fall off.

44
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,910
- I saw them.
- What? How many were there?

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,275
- Did you see the kids?
- Libby.

46
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,760
We need to go. Now.

47
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,673
All right, we're moving out.

48
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,308
Now.

49
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,036
So, does all this...

50
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,078
...the tent, the flowers...

51
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,835
...mean that we're serious now?

52
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,229
Quite definitely not.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,233
I do this for all the girls I meet
on deserted islands.

54
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,830
Don't go anywhere.

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,350
- Where are you going?
- To get some water.

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,991
Let me.

57
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,878
I'll be right back.

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,390
That was quick.

59
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,077
There's nothing. There's no one there.

60
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,119
- I'm telling you. I saw Walt.
- It was a dream, Shannon...

61
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,670
He was here. I saw him.
He went into the tent.

62
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,478
I was only gone a few moments.

63
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,475
- You must have fallen asleep...
- This was not a dream. I saw Walt!

64
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,915
Then where is he?

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,752
Hey... What's going on?

66
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,592
Nothing. It's just a dream.

67
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,511
Everything's fine.

68
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,076
Shannon...

69
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,152
- What's wrong?
- Shannon had a nightmare.

70
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,151
And why is he up?

71
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,276
- I woke him.
- You woke him?

72
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,478
I heard screams, I got worried.
Would you rather I had left him alone?

73
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,199
You woke up the baby
and ran towards them?

74
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,750
- It sounded like she needed help...
- He's gonna need feeding.

75
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,673
He's going to be up all night
and fussy all day.

76
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,557
- Sorry.
- All right. No harm done.

77
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Give him here, then. I got him...

78
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,315
Hey, it's OK.

79
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,389
It's OK.

80
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,393
Wait.

81
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,833
Wait.

82
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,229
- Come back and let's talk about this.
- Do you believe me?

83
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,555
No. I know what I saw.

84
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,552
Beautiful, Sophie. OK, can you bring
your shoulders down for me a little?

85
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,995
Extend up. Good.

86
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,390
And, finish. Very nice, ladies.

87
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,358
Did my papa see me?

88
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,433
I think so.

89
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,959
Wonderful.

90
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,039
All right, thank you
for a great class today, ladies.

91
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,111
Very nice work, Tina.

92
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,071
He wants me to be his au pair.
Can you believe that?

93
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,275
Au pair, my ass.

94
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,750
"Live in my big house,
take care of my kids."

95
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,833
Next thing, it's "Oh, I am sorry.
I did not know you were in the shower."

96
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,876
Please. What a perv.

97
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,477
- Hello?
- <i>Shannon,</i>

98
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,630
<i>your father's been in an accident.</i>

99
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,679
<i>I'm on my way to St Sebastian's...</i>
<i>I'll meet you there.</i>

100
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,512
- Mrs Rutherford?
- Yes.

101
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,478
Why don't we talk down here?

102
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,952
Doctor, my husband, Adam. How is he?

103
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,838
Your husband
was in a head-on collision with an SUV.

104
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,878
He suffered massive internal injuries.

105
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,638
He stopped breathing
at the site of the accident.

106
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm afraid
we were unable to resuscitate him.

107
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,636
I'm so sorry.

108
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,232
- May I see him?
- Of course.

109
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,432
- Would your daughter like to come?
- Stepdaughter.

110
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,396
Come on, Shannon.

111
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,119
How much further to their camp?

112
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,749
A day. Maybe more. Maybe less.

113
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,718
Thanks for being so specific.

114
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,590
Damn it!

115
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,115
I'm OK. I'm fine.

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,430
You wanna let me
just take a look at your shoulder?

117
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,557
- What are you, a doctor?
- Clinical psychologist.

118
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,915
You're a shrink.

119
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,150
Maybe you ought to talk to my shoulder.

120
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,719
- How'd you get shot anyway?
- With a gun.

121
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,598
He got shot when they took my kid.

122
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,959
- It's bad, right?
- Yeah, it's bad.

123
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,315
But it's not real bad.

124
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,278
Come on, you're gonna be OK.

125
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,351
Let's go.

126
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,950
I'm all right. I'm fine.

127
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,556
Let me give you a hand, OK?

128
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,630
Um, tell me again why we're doing this
here when there's a dryer in the hatch?

129
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,314
I don't like the hatch.

130
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,039
It's because of the doomsday button,
isn't it?

131
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,079
Well, who needs a dryer
when we've got sun and fresh air?

132
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,072
Wouldn't wanna spoil ourselves,
now, would we?

133
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,116
Yeah, "spoil".

134
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,430
Do you know where Michael and Walt

135
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,557
left the stuff that they didn't
take with them on the raft?

136
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,677
- What kind of stuff?
- Their clothes?

137
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,799
I think their stuff's still on the
beach, back where their tent is.

138
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,199
Thanks.

139
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,830
Poor thing.

140
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,755
Can't be easy, losing the one person
you love on the island.

141
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,671
Here, smell this. That's his, right?
Come on, get a good whiff.

142
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,276
You're always trying to run off
and find him, then find him. Find Walt.

143
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,429
Good dog. Find Walt!

144
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,633
I know I woke you
and I'm so very, very sorry,

145
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,712
but, please,
staying awake for eight hours straight?

146
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,189
Isn't that
cruel and unusual punishment?

147
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,510
How's that cradle treating you?

148
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,592
The cradle's great,
it's the baby that's the problem.

149
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,633
- What's wrong?
- He just won't sleep.

150
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,232
May I?

151
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,958
Sure.

152
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,989
Babies like the feeling
of being constricted.

153
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,039
It's not until we're older
that we develop the desire to be free.

154
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,078
There.

155
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,153
You know, I think everybody
knows more about my baby than me.

156
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,674
Everybody?

157
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,355
Charlie read me the riot act last night
for waking him.

158
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,353
And as mad as it made me,
turns out he was right.

159
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,792
It's like we're playing
"Mum and Dad" to this baby,

160
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,235
yet I don't remember marrying him.

161
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,789
Seriously. We're practically strangers.
Charlie could be some religious freak.

162
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,757
I seriously doubt that.

163
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,549
Then why does he carry around
a Virgin Mary statue?

164
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,553
- A what?
- You know, one of the little statues?

165
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,279
He says he found it in the jungle.

166
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,396
How about that?

167
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,832
I'm so sorry.

168
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,480
Thank you, Jerry.
I'm so glad you could come.

169
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,238
- If you need anything, please call me.
- Thank you.

170
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,635
Death sucks, doesn't it?

171
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,188
Boone!

172
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

173
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,119
I'm so sorry, Shan.

174
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,914
You came back.

175
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,278
- Where'd the poster of Marky Mark go?
- I'm 18, Boone.

176
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,514
- Your mom's gonna freak.
- It's a wake.

177
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,352
I mean, seriously,
who doesn't serve booze at a wake?

178
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,631
Scotch?

179
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,640
To your dad.

180
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,752
Maybe after all this
you'll come visit me in New York.

181
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,674
I won't have to visit if I get that job
at the Martha Graham Dance Company.

182
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,320
I'll be living there.

183
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,709
Right. Internship.

184
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,037
I know it's, like, a one in three
thousand chance, but I might get it.

185
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,918
Absolutely.

186
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,435
Have you spoken to my mother?

187
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,197
She's going through her thing
and I'm going through mine.

188
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,159
Have you two been getting along?

189
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,109
She hates me.

190
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,195
Just try to talk to her.

191
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,712
From day one,
she resented my relationship with him.

192
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,112
With Dad.

193
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,313
- We need a break.
- Five minutes.

194
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,277
Here.

195
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,956
What are you looking at?

196
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,395
We have to cut inland.

197
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,835
What? Into the jungle?

198
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,630
They said their people
were on the beach.

199
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,315
- If we keep walking...
- The beach curves into a peninsula.

200
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,474
It may not be passable.

201
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,232
May not?

202
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,558
May not.

203
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,832
You're doing this to get
the cowboy back faster, aren't you?

204
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,593
You would risk our lives to help him?

205
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,796
It's the only way I know.

206
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,392
I liked you better
when you weren't talking.

207
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,673
I can't believe he's still asleep.

208
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,153
Swaddling works every time.

209
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,518
Hey, do you want to hold him?

210
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,396
That's OK.

211
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,710
Put your arms out.

212
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,712
It's OK. There.

213
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,071
- He smells good.
- Doesn't he?

214
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,388
Yeah.

215
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,639
Oh.

216
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,593
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello.

217
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,752
Hey, John just taught me a new trick.
Swaddling.

218
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,713
That's excellent.

219
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,758
I just came to take him
so you could have your walk.

220
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,151
Well, great timing.
Yeah, I got to get going.

221
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,319
I got him.

222
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,315
Well, thanks for your help, John.

223
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,038
You're welcome.

224
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,268
What?

225
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,352
I'm fine. I'm fine, damn it.

226
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,592
Shut up!

227
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,673
- What? They can't talk at all?
- If he talks he'll get us all killed.

228
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,548
By what? Them? I thought
they lived a day back that way.

229
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,394
How about you shut your mouth
and get your buddy over here moving?

230
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,756
What happened to you people?

231
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,228
You want us to take you back with us,
fine.

232
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,356
But you want me to keep quiet?

233
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,118
Then you need to tell me why I have to.

234
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,672
They came
the first night that we got here.

235
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,074
They took three of us.

236
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,754
Nothing happened for two weeks.

237
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,912
Then they came back, and took nine more.

238
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,670
They're smart.

239
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,435
And they're animals.
And they could be anywhere, at any time.

240
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,070
Now we're moving through the jungle...
their jungle...

241
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,190
just so that you can save
your little hick friend over here.

242
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,433
And if you think that one gun
and one bullet is gonna stop them...

243
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,309
think again.

244
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,957
So, shut your mouth, and keep moving.

245
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,429
They took my son.

246
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,680
They took a lot of things.

247
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,790
I know what it is
to lose someone you care deeply about.

248
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,638
You really think
that this is all about Boone?

249
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,558
I saw Walt, Sayid.

250
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,798
Then why are we sitting
at Boone's grave?

251
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,670
- Just go back, Sayid.
- Where are you going?

252
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,032
To find him.

253
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,836
It came.

254
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,878
What? Oh, my God.

255
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,751
Open it.

256
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,878
- I can't open it.
- You what?

257
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,949
You open it.

258
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,476
You've been waiting 6 months
for this letter. No way I'm opening it.

259
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,551
- I got it.
- You got it?

260
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,315
- I got it!
- Oh, my God, you're going to New York!

261
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,358
You're going to New York! Oh, my God!

262
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,716
Hello. Yeah, this is her.

263
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,117
That's impossible.

264
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,316
OK, are you sure?

265
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,878
Of course. I will certainly do that.

266
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,358
Sorry.

267
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,712
What?

268
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,597
My rent cheque bounced.

269
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,519
But you're like... rich.

270
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,274
I would have offered you a drink,
but I have a meeting in ten minutes.

271
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,070
Yeah. My cheques are bouncing.

272
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,516
That happens when you withdraw
and you don't deposit.

273
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,398
When do I get the money Dad left me?

274
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,875
The money from the will?

275
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,871
There was no will.

276
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,552
What?

277
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,315
Shannon,
your father and I had a living trust.

278
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,277
Everything passed to me.

279
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,955
I'm afraid there was nothing
specifically designated for you.

280
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,473
Why would he do that?

281
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,950
Well, maybe he just wanted you
to find your own way.

282
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,432
We all have to work, Shannon.

283
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,353
And most of us are the better for it.

284
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,479
I can work. I just got
this really prestigious internship

285
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,154
and I'm not gonna
make any money for a while

286
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,959
but I'm gonna be working
like 16 hours a day.

287
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,749
The only thing I've ever seen you do
16 hours a day straight is sleep.

288
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,640
I just need to get to New York.

289
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,915
I need just something to get started.

290
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,510
- I'll pay you back.
- This week it's an internship.

291
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,229
Last year it was, what...
interior design?

292
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,069
You'll never pay me back.

293
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,553
And you'll only hate yourself even more.

294
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,198
I really want this, Sabrina.

295
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,952
I can do this.

296
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,475
I'm sorry, Shannon.

297
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,113
You're on your own.

298
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,796
Double sixes, how nice for you.

299
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,871
Lucky.

300
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,195
I hope you didn't get the wrong idea
about seeing me with the baby.

301
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,871
What wrong idea would that be?

302
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,671
You and Claire are close,
and you spend a lot of time with Aaron.

303
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,194
I just wouldn't want
to overstep my bounds.

304
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,638
Did she tell you we had a fight?

305
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,553
She didn't say it was a fight.

306
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,868
She was gonna give it up, you know...
for adoption.

307
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,711
- She tell you that?
- Yeah. When I built the cradle.

308
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,788
Oh, of course.

309
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,711
When you built the cradle.

310
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,071
Why do you ask?

311
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,948
She's got a bit to learn...
about being a mum.

312
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,760
Responsibility and all.

313
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,830
Now, that's an interesting thing
to say, for a heroin addict.

314
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,796
- Recovering addict.
- Recovering.

315
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,870
It's your turn.

316
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,108
Here, let me help you.

317
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,678
I got it.

318
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,911
I said I got him, man. Take a break.

319
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,549
What?
You suddenly give a damn about me?

320
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,398
Just leave me alone. Both of you.

321
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,557
I got it.

322
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,673
Hey! Hey! Hey-hey-hey!

323
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,159
Come here. Come on.

324
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,076
Hey, Sawyer. Hey, you OK?

325
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,431
I would have left you behind.

326
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,670
Shut up, man. Don't try to...

327
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,394
I did leave you behind.

328
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,836
Yeah, well, good thing I ain't you.

329
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,950
Hey! Hey, hey! No, Sawyer.
Sawyer!

330
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,799
Sawyer! Hey!

331
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,673
Water! Water!

332
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,196
- Sawyer! Sawyer. Come on, man.
- Here you go.

333
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,477
Here. Here. Thank you.

334
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,232
Come on.

335
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,356
Sawyer.

336
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,714
- What's the matter with him?
- The fever.

337
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,951
- He's got an infection, dehydrated.
- We gotta keep moving.

338
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,270
- What?
- We gotta keep going.

339
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,958
You wanna stay?
That's fine, but we're rolling out.

340
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,712
We can't just leave him, Ana.

341
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,712
Maybe if we rest a while,
he'll regain consciousness.

342
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,598
Rest? Here?

343
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,875
Do you remember what happened to us?

344
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,793
What they did to us?

345
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,791
Do you remember Goodwin?

346
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,599
Ana's right,
maybe we should just push on.

347
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,069
You know what?
I don't remember Goodwin,

348
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,517
and I'm really sorry about whatever
happened to him, but I don't care.

349
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,912
Mr Eko,
can you help me make a stretcher?

350
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,878
Hey, Bernard, I need four sticks...
sturdy ones, about five feet long.

351
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,474
- Got it.
- You're gonna carry your friend.

352
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:53,155
Yeah. We're gonna carry him.

353
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,195
- Why are you doing this, Shannon?
- I didn't ask you to follow me.

354
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,589
You'd rather be alone
and get lost or hurt.

355
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,468
- I don't need your help, Sayid!
- Walt is not out here!

356
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,075
You are following a Labrador
to find a boy who is on a raft...

357
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,118
- He's not on the raft.
- What are you talking about?

358
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,915
We found the bottle on the beach.

359
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,757
The bottle with the messages
that they brought with them?

360
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,513
I know he's out here somewhere.
I saw Walt.

361
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,948
And the raft is gone
and he is all alone.

362
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,358
Shannon...

363
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,999
Come on!

364
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,757
Cindy...

365
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,471
Cindy!

366
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,357
Where's Cindy?

367
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,109
- What? She was just here...
- Cindy! Cindy!

368
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,839
- Did they take her?
- How could she just be gone?

369
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,638
Cindy!

370
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,271
- I'm going after her.
- No. We stay together.

371
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,749
We split up,
we give them what they want.

372
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,793
This is all your fault! We never
should have gone through the jungle.

373
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,030
You risked our lives to save him.

374
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,351
He's already dead. This one's on you.

375
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,871
What the hell is that?

376
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,475
- Oh, God.
- Run!

377
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,390
- Hey.
- Hey.

378
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,229
She said no.

379
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,111
I guess she knew
why I asked for the money.

380
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,473
Can I crash at your place
in New York for just a little while?

381
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,595
Until I get on my feet?

382
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,240
I'm leaving New York.

383
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,959
She offered me a job.

384
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,758
- You're going to work for your mother?
- It's a really good job, Shannon.

385
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,152
This is all I have, but my trust fund
will kick in at the end of the month.

386
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,038
And after that
I can absolutely keep you afloat.

387
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,672
Thank you, but I'm gonna figure out
a way to make my own money.

388
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,638
But who knows when that's gonna be.
Just take it.

389
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,913
- What, you don't think I can do it?
- I didn't say that.

390
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,275
Do you believe I can or don't you,
Boone?

391
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,676
OK, you know what? I really want you
to just take your money.

392
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,320
- Go work for your mother. Take it!
- Shannon.

393
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,676
- I'm trying to help you, Shannon!
- I don't want your money!

394
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,838
OK.

395
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,273
- Shannon! Are you OK?
- Do not help me up!

396
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,196
Let's go back.

397
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,240
Why don't you believe me?

398
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,149
- I need you to believe in me!
- I do believe in you.

399
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,676
You don't. No one does.

400
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,789
They think that I am some kind of joke.

401
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:42,396
- They think I'm worthless.
- Shannon, you are not worthless.

402
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,910
You say that now...

403
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,111
...but you don't...

404
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,110
You're just gonna leave me.

405
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,358
I know, as soon as we get out of here,
you're just gonna leave me.

406
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,156
I will never leave you.

407
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,157
I love you.

408
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,477
And I believe you.

409
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,992
You do?

410
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,349
I do.

411
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,636
Do you see him?

412
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,918
Walt!

413
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,228
Walt!

414
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,829
Walt!

415
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,112
- Walt!
- Shannon!

416
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,475
Walt... wait!

417
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,079
Shannon!

418
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,036
Shannon!

419
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,553
Shannon!
