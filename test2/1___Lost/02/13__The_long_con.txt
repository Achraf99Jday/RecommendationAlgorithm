00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,366
[narrator] Previously on Lost:

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,997
- Charlie. Give me the baby.
- Who the hell are you, John?

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:10,702
Aaron's not your responsibility.
Where were you when he was born?

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,768
Where were you when he was taken?

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,475
You're not his father.
You're not his family.

6
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,676
Neither are you, Charlie.

7
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,719
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:33,624
This is not your island.
This is our island.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,293
And the only reason you're living on it

10
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,769
is because we let you live on it.

11
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,867
Right here, there's a line.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,038
You cross that line,

13
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,845
we go from misunderstanding
to something else.

14
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,881
It's your call, Jack.

15
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:57,320
- Sayid tells me that you're a cop.
- I was a cop.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,023
- Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

17
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:08,260
How long do you think it would take
to train an army?

18
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,110
- Is that all of them?
- All six of them.

19
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:31,180
Plus one box of ammo.

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,293
At least we don't have to worry
about running out anytime soon.

21
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,958
Jack, I'm grateful that you decided
to keep them all in the same place.

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,331
I had to take them from Charlie.
His heroin stash.

23
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,405
I figured it might have therapeutic
value, if it ever came to that.

24
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,981
You're just gonna leave it all
in the statues?

25
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,850
You wanna break seven Virgin Marys,
be my guest. I'm superstitious.

26
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,150
John.

27
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,356
The combination.

28
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,690
I'm gonna assume that you're asking me

29
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,792
because you're worried that I might
fall off a cliff or something,

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,772
that it's irresponsible for just one
of us to have access to this room,

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,867
rather than this being
an issue of trust.

32
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,643
Well, there are a lot of cliffs
on this island, John.

33
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,148
All right.
But I think we should agree, Jack,

34
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:41,023
that if either of us need to open
this door, we consult each other first.

35
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,994
Absolutely.

36
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:46,225
Right seven, left 33, right 1 8.

37
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,597
- You need to write it down?
- No. I got it.

38
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,192
[Locke] All right.

39
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,037
And, Jack, you may want to consider
locking the medicine in here, too.

40
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,142
Why would I need to do that?

41
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:05,151
Well, well. Look who had to relocate
to the suburbs.

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,367
Man, I thought these people hated me,
but I gotta hand it to you.

45
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,531
Stealing the baby
and trying to drown it?

46
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,873
Now, that's a new low.
You even made Locke take a swing at you.

47
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,176
Hell, that's like getting Gandhi
to beat his kids.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:40,175
Shouldn't you be more worried about Jack
ransacking your tent right now?

49
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,277
What?

50
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:54,756
- What the hell you think you're doing?
- You stole these from the hatch.

51
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,995
- You stole them from me.
- What?

52
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,765
They were in my stash.
I took back what was mine.

53
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,036
These belong to all of us, Sawyer.
To the group.

54
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,703
- You don't have a stash anymore.
- Doc, you don't wanna do this.

55
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,115
Just give me the pills,
we'll forget it ever happened.

56
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,612
Are you threatening me?

57
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,282
Last chance, Doc.

58
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,992
What do you want, right now?

59
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,465
Just you.

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,012
Oh, damn it.

61
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,448
What is it?

62
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,045
I'm gonna be late
for that meeting I told you about.

63
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,854
Meeting, huh? You got another date,
you can just say so.

64
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:32,387
I can only wrap my mind
around one woman at a time,

65
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,864
but I appreciate the permission.

66
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,835
Back in a flash, gorgeous.

67
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,307
You weren't exactly
supposed to see that.

68
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,044
Are you serious?

69
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,109
- What?
- You're not serious?

70
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,823
You just happen to have
a suitcase full of cash,

71
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,587
and you go to pick it up
and then the lock just happens to break?

72
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,426
- Give me that.
- It's not even real.

73
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,602
Newspaper?

74
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,840
Are you trying to con me?

75
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,466
What, I ask you what all the money's for

76
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,344
and you do some song and dance
about an investment or something

77
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,474
and then I say,
"Hey, oh, I've got some money."

78
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,113
Look, you got me.

79
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,481
Good for you.

80
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,720
No harm, no foul.

81
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,229
You should've done your homework.

82
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:41,425
I didn't take anything from him
in the divorce.

83
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,835
I'm not even worth your trouble.

84
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,640
Well, shame on me.

85
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,373
I want you to show me what you do.

86
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,555
Show me what you do.
What you really do.

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,025
And what do I do?

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,656
Show me how to con people, Sawyer.

89
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,799
[Kate]
I like what you've done with the place.

90
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,642
Maid's day off.

91
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,180
You wanna move?

92
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:38,053
- Heard Jack took your painkillers.
- Guess me and the doc are on the outs.

93
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,922
One less Christmas card
I'll have to send this year.

94
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,087
Maybe that'll cheer you up.
It's from the hatch.

95
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,461
I know you're hard up
for reading material.

96
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:51,492
Well, as much as I'd like to learn
to "feather my hair,"

97
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,232
I lost my damn glasses on the raft.

98
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,610
You wanna read it to me?

99
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,772
You got an appointment or something?

100
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,848
OK.

101
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,650
All right. "Ten Ways To Tell
If He's A Sensitive Man."

102
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,193
- This ought to be good.
- [Locke] Morning.

103
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,252
[Kate] Hey, John.

104
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,465
Now, there's a sensitive man.

105
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,231
- Claire asked him to sleep down here.
- Come on.

106
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,796
Locke's got himself needs,

107
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,605
just like anyone else.

108
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,736
Not everyone is like you, Sawyer.

109
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:39,708
Guess that's why El Jacko and Ana Lulu
didn't ask me to join their revolution.

110
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:45,347
What? You didn't hear
about their little army?

111
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:51,754
Guess I'm not the only one
on the outs with the doc.

112
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,977
Hey, man.

113
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:08,376
You gonna put the lime in the coconut,
drink them both up?

114
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,241
Lime in the coconut?

115
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,553
The song?

116
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,014
What do you want, Hurley?

117
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,218
I'm over at Rose and Bernard's tent...

118
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,354
Did you know he's a dentist?

119
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,990
Well, that's not all
he's been holding out on us.

120
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,966
He picked up Boone's signal
from the Norwegian plane.

121
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,037
Nigerian.

122
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,904
Right. Anyhow,
he picked it up with this.

123
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:43,381
That is a short-wave radio.
It's a glorified walkie-talkie.

124
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:47,543
Yeah, but can't you switch a blue wire
with a red wire and make it stronger?

125
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,520
We tried to send a signal
with the plane's transceiver

126
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,751
and all we got was
the French woman's message on a loop.

127
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,387
- Why would I bother?
- Come on, man. I mean, it's worth...

128
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,160
It's worth nothing.
It's a waste of time.

129
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,096
I was just trying to cheer you up, dude.

130
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:08,038
I don't need cheering up.

131
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,634
OK, man. Sorry. No problem.

132
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,513
[Ana Lucia] Hey.

133
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,490
Hey.

134
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,961
- Hey.
- You get the combo?

135
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:38,463
Nice. Didn't think it'd be that easy
convincing your pal to give it up.

136
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,870
That's the nice thing about you people,

137
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,967
you're not scared enough.

138
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:50,978
- Not scared enough?
- Same reason no one'll join the army.

139
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,214
Everyone around here
actually thinks they're safe.

140
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,214
Trust me, Ana, no one thinks we're safe.

141
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,394
So, Jack, what's the combo?

142
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,169
I was just kidding.

143
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,543
[thunder]

144
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,914
[rustling]

145
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,734
[rustling]

146
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,635
[rustling continues]

147
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,114
Oh, Vincent.

148
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,550
What are you doing out here?

149
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,312
[speaks Korean]

150
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,391
[thunder]

151
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,470
[Sun yells]

152
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,206
Oh, man, it's really coming down.
Get under here, Freckles!

153
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,181
- I like the rain.
- Yeah, me too, from under here.

154
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,651
[screaming]

155
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,655
- What the hell?
- It's Sun.

156
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,542
- Is she all right?
- She's breathing.

157
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,011
Go get Jack. Go get Jack.

158
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,706
OK.

159
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,946
- What happened?
- Where's Jack?

160
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,062
Was she conscious at all?

161
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,325
- Did she say anything?
- Not a word.

162
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,562
- [Jin speaks Korean]
- She's OK. She's going to be all right.

163
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,105
You need to let me take care of her,
all right? Please.

164
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,871
- How'd you find her?
- I heard her scream.

165
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,537
She was out cold,
and her hands were tied.

166
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,615
What do you mean her hands were tied?

167
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,618
They're back.

168
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,728
- They said they would leave us alone.
- They broke their promise.

169
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,823
- We don't even know what happened.
- Do we need to know?

170
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,766
- Where'd you find her?
- Just outside her garden.

171
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,638
We should take a look around. With guns.

172
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,609
No.

173
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,369
No?

174
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:12,406
We arm up, we're just as likely to shoot
each other as we are one of them.

175
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:19,323
OK. We'll wait for Sun to wake up.
She'll tell us what happened.

176
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,882
Then we're gonna do something about it.

177
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,129
Sounds like a plan.

178
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,835
[Kate]
They usually don't leave any trail.

179
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,901
[Sawyer] It's worth a look.

180
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,980
Let me ask you something.

181
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,916
This whole scenario make sense to you?

182
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,987
What do you mean?

183
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,683
Think about it.
First off, how'd she get away?

184
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,489
- Woman doesn't weigh 1 00 pounds.
- She was fighting for her life.

185
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:59,860
- People are capable of anything...
- You couldn't get away.

186
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,662
And you versus Sun,
hot-oil death match?

187
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,736
My money's on you, Sheena.

188
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,294
Thanks for your vote of confidence.

189
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,447
It's a hood, just like the one
they put over my head.

190
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,353
No, it's not.
This one's black. Different weave.

191
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:32,154
It's all in the details,
and they're wrong.

192
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,660
Well, if it wasn't them, then who?

193
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,198
What are you saying, one of us did it?
Who the hell would wanna go after Sun?

194
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,303
Not much upside
to scaring the crap out of 46 people.

195
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,949
Unless you're trying to con them
into joining an army.

196
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,255
Those necklaces are junk, Sawyer.

197
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,352
A five-year-old could tell that.

198
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,422
They ain't gonna look at the necklaces.
They're gonna look at the price.

199
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,991
It's all in the details, Dimples.

200
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,006
- What if we get caught?
- We ain't gonna get caught.

201
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:19,534
Anybody goes to the cops,
the only thing they're gonna remember

202
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,170
is a guy who looks like
he's been in a bar fight.

203
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,683
- You're scared, huh?
- A little bit.

204
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:36,151
Well, here's the good news, baby.
Everybody's scared.

205
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:42,863
And the thing they're scared of most
is missing an opportunity.

206
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,801
- This is all they had.
- Let's try down the street.

207
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:55,108
Hey. You guys
wanna buy some necklaces?

208
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,546
- Where'd you get them?
- Where do you think?

209
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,084
You want to buy them or not?

210
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,714
- Forget it.
- [woman] Hey, how much?

211
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,085
- Hundred a piece.
- For any of them?

212
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,028
Yeah, yeah. Taster's choice.

213
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:17,159
I'll take the $1,200 one
and the $1,300 one.

214
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,703
- Thanks.
- Hey, wait.

215
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:26,177
- Wait up, man. I'll buy some of those.
- Yeah, me too.

216
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:32,612
- [man 1] Dana's birthday's next week.
- [man 2] They love their jewelery.

217
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,750
[man 1] Five, six, seven hundred.

218
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,958
Pulse is good, strong.

219
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:46,260
You just need to watch her.

220
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,867
She's gonna be OK, man.

221
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:17,485
That bump on her head, do you think
she fell or that someone hit her?

222
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,588
I don't know.

223
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,036
Jack, how well do you know Ana Lucia?

224
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,040
I was just... The Others...

225
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,037
I was out there with you.

226
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,413
I heard that man say if we stayed away,
they'd leave us alone.

227
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,182
We've left them alone, so why would
they attack us a few days later?

228
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,748
If it wasn't them, then who was it?

229
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,665
Like I said,
how well do you know Ana Lucia?

230
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,543
[Ana Lucia] I got a couple more people
interested in joining up.

231
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,917
Yeah? Who?

232
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,790
The big guy
who lives behind Sayid, and Scott.

233
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,886
You mean Steve. Scott's dead.

234
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,056
Scott, Steve...

235
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,135
The point is, after what happened,

236
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,796
people are finally willing
to do something.

237
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,864
Where were you this morning?

238
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:40,411
- Lots of places.
- During the rainstorm.

239
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,816
You think I had something
to do with Sun getting grabbed?

240
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,355
Now, where would you
get an idea like that?

241
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,324
[Claire] Jack! Jack.

242
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,531
[Claire] Sun's awake.

243
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,866
[Sun groans, gasps]

244
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,628
Hey.

245
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,144
How's your head? Any pain? Dizziness?

246
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,772
- Just a little bit.
- Do you remember anything?

247
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,648
I was working in my garden
when Vincent ran up.

248
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:26,055
It started raining, then there was a bag
over my head, and I was being dragged.

249
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:30,561
- How many were there?
- I don't... I didn't see anything.

250
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,494
[Jin speaks Korean]

251
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,930
[Sun replies in Korean]

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,802
I kicked and I fought, and I just ran
as fast as I could. And then I fell...

253
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,308
[Jin and Sun speak Korean]

254
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,843
Gun.

255
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,939
Gun!

256
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,013
Gun.

257
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,196
Hey. What's going on?

258
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,899
Looks like the good folks of lslandtown
are about to form a posse,

259
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,736
get themselves armed up.

260
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,300
I wouldn't be surprised
if Jack didn't find that horse of yours,

261
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,109
start leading the charge
in a big white hat.

262
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,383
The guns.

263
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,486
This is all her play
to get her hands on the guns.

264
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,159
Locke. You need to go
and tell him they're coming.

265
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,363
I need to tell him?

266
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,274
Sawyer, please.

267
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,182
- So, what's next?
- Next?

268
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,275
The next play.

269
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:06,750
- I'll show you the pigeon drop.
- We already did that. Twice.

270
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,420
And the Tulsa bag scam,
and the Looky-loo.

271
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,362
- I wanna do a big one.
- You wanna do a big what?

272
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,198
A big con.

273
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:20,271
It's called a long con.

274
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,468
OK, a long con. How does it work?

275
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:30,747
It works by getting someone to ask you
to do something like it's their idea,

276
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,444
but it's your idea.

277
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,748
But none of that matters,

278
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:40,417
'cause the one thing you need
for a long con, we ain't got.

279
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,993
Money.

280
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,086
I have money.

281
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,759
Sorry, Cassie. 40 grand
in some mutual fund ain't money.

282
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,271
Remember when I told you that
I didn't get anything from the divorce?

283
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,341
I kind of lied.

284
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,669
You kind of lied how much?

285
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,770
600 grand.

286
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,911
Hell, with that kind of money,
let's go find an island somewhere

287
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:12,946
and sit on the beach
drinking mojitos till we go toes up.

288
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:18,018
Sawyer, for the first time in my life
I'm actually happy.

289
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,834
And it's not really about the action
or the money.

290
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,994
It's about doing this with you.

291
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,330
Come on.

292
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:31,432
One long con.

293
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,836
And then the mojitos.

294
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,279
I'll think about it.

295
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,122
Why don't you think about it in here?

296
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:02,464
Hate to interrupt
whatever the hell it is you're doing.

297
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,641
- What are you doing?
- I'm alphabetizing.

298
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,609
Oh, sure.
Sun gets attacked in the jungle

299
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,174
and you figure it's a good time
to start the Dewey decimal system.

300
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,312
- Good thinking.
- How can I help you, James?

301
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:22,851
Well, actually, John, I'm here
to help you, give you the heads up.

302
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,520
Heads up?

303
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,564
Jack's on his way over
to open your little gun closet

304
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,397
and take whatever he needs.
You should know he's not alone.

305
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:35,030
Whole camp's pretty shook up
about what happened to Tokyo Rose.

306
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,599
I'm guessing everybody's gonna
wanna play cowboys and lndians.

307
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:43,738
And once those guns are out and about,

308
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,841
something tells me
they ain't never going back in.

309
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,625
Why are you telling me this?

310
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,494
Because it'll piss off Jack.

311
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,531
But if I were you,
I'd change that combination pronto.

312
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,900
But that won't work.
The door will just slow him down.

313
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,739
If Jack wants to get in, he'll get in.

314
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,815
Will you help me?

315
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,779
Help you what?

316
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,878
Move the guns.

317
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,454
Move them where?

318
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,519
Fine. You don't wanna trust me,
lots of luck.

319
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,588
But I can't leave the hatch unmanned.

320
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,862
Sure. You move the guns,

321
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,236
and I'll stay here
and push your damn button for you.

322
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,832
How long till they get here?

323
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:48,310
Well, that ain't my problem, Hoss.
It's yours.

324
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,624
Steak sandwich. Two beers.

325
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,492
- Thank you.
- Aw, shucks. You got a beer for me?

326
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,003
You want one, ask the lady.

327
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:17,165
Ha! Well, hell, I do want one.

328
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:21,336
And could I get a plate
of chicken salad, white meat only,

329
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,812
and please, God, no celery,
OK, sweetheart?

330
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,113
That's how we make it here, darlin'.

331
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,318
So, tell me you got her.

332
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,292
- Yeah, I got her.
- All 600 grand?

333
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,390
All six.

334
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:49,436
You fell for her.

335
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,203
- You gotta be kidding me.
- It's got nothing...

336
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,711
- I found that bitch.
- Her name is Cassidy.

337
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,612
I waited six months
while you played house.

338
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,673
I ain't doing it.

339
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,450
Know what's making you stupid?
It's your damn hormones.

340
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,491
You think you're in love,
but you're not.

341
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,323
A tiger doesn't change
his stripes, James.

342
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,295
You're a con man, just like me.

343
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,832
And it's not what you do,
it's what you are.

344
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,890
Do I make myself clear?

345
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm sorry, man. I just can't do it.

346
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,834
No, you're gonna do it.

347
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,675
Because that girl,
she doesn't know you one bit.

348
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:33,306
But when she finds out who you are,
who you really are,

349
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,715
she's gonna hate your guts.

350
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,415
Yeah, well...

351
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,564
Enjoy your chicken salad, Gordy.

352
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,395
Wait a minute. You don't walk away now.

353
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,994
You owe me. You don't wanna pay me?

354
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,973
I'll put one in your ear, James.

355
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,012
You and your little friend Cassidy.

- One second.

I'm like this close to the high score
on Donkey Kong.

[speaks Korean]

360
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,149
Now, what can I do you for?

361
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,815
- Where's Locke?
- I don't know.

362
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:50,361
I think he said something about going
to the store for a pack of smokes.

363
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,241
Uh-oh.
Looks like we got ourselves a theft.

364
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,251
- Who's gonna call the cops?
- Where are they?

365
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,377
Don't look at me.
I was just pushing the button.

366
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,023
Oh, yeah. I believe these are yours.

367
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,466
No.

[speaks Korean]

369
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,986
John. Where are they?

370
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,587
You moved the guns. Where are they?

371
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,657
We had an agreement!

372
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,169
An agreement you were about to violate.

373
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,466
Yes, I moved the guns.

374
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,272
Where?

375
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,812
Where? Where, John?

376
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,872
Are you going to start handing them out?

377
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,349
How many? Who gets them?

378
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,152
How much time before
there's an accident? Another accident?

379
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,520
I made a mistake teaching Michael
how to shoot, and now he's...

380
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,294
He could be dead for all I know,
and that was my fault.

381
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:42,135
I take responsibility for that, so I'm
taking responsibility for the guns, too.

382
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,266
- I want two guns.
- That's the way it's gonna be, Jack.

385
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,754
You gave him the guns?

386
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,925
No, I hid them.

387
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,591
That's right, Jack.
He's as stupid as you are.

388
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:14,570
You were so busy worrying about each
other, you never even saw me coming.

389
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:25,910
So, how about you listen up?
Because I'm only gonna say this once.

390
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,647
You took my stuff.

391
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:36,854
While I was off trying to get us help,
get us rescued,

392
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:41,489
you found my stash,
and you took it, divvied it up.

My shaving cream, my batteries,

even my beer.

395
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,407
And then something else happened.

00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:55,242
You decided these two boys were gonna
tell you what to do and when to do it.

Well, I'm done taking orders.

398
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,310
And I don't want my stuff back.

399
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,315
Shaving cream don't matter.

400
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,220
Batteries don't matter.

401
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:17,099
Only thing that matters now are guns.

402
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:23,030
And if you want one, you're gonna
have to come to me to get it.

Oh, you wanna torture me, don't you?

Show everybody how civilized you are.

Go ahead, but I'll die
before I give them back.

406
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:45,426
And then you'll really be screwed,
won't you?

There's a new sheriff in town, boys.

- [Sawyer] See that black car?
- [Cassidy] Who is it?

- His name's Gordy. My partner.

in two minutes, we're both dead.

and we both know
you can't track worth a damn.

All that stuff you said about Ana Lucia.
You knew I would go to Jack.

And you knew I'd ask you to go to Locke.

457
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,809
Now how in the world
would I know all that?

458
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:35,450
Did you have anything to do with Sun?

What kind of a person
do I think you are?

461
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,333
I don't think
this has anything to do with guns,

462
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,597
or with getting your stash back.

463

00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,802
- Cool. You fixed it.
- We'll see.

471
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,139
Hold onto this.

472
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,479
Don't expect anything.

473
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,782
The chances of getting a signal
are slim at best.

474
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,886
[radio static]

475
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,758
- Static's good, right?
- No. Reception is good.

476
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,562
- [woman speaks French]
- What's that?

477
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,141
- It's Rousseau's signal.
- Oh, crap.

478
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,540
But this radio has a wider bandwidth.

479
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,515
- [music]
- Oh, wait. Stop. Do you hear that?

480
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,310
[man] That was... Just A-Settin'...

481
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,013
[radio static]

482
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:49,651
...Duke Ellington Orchestra,
featuring Cootie... the trumpet.

483
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,025
Up next on WXR,

484
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:56,396
the Glenn Miller Orchestra
with Moonlight Serenade.

485
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:59,595
[? Glenn Miller Orchestra:
Moonlight Serenade]

486
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,944
Whoa.

487
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,276
You hear how clear that is?

488
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,509
That's gotta be close, right?

489
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,677
Radio waves at this frequency
bounce off the ionosphere.

490
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,046
They can travel thousands of miles.

491
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,490
It could be coming from anywhere.

492
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,667
Or any time.

493
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,365
Just kidding, dude.

494
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,113
[radio static]

495
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,200
He never saw you, huh?

496
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,008
No. He was more worried about
his sodding guns than being followed.

497
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,792
Figured you'd want your friends back.

498
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:34,797
If I wanted them, I would've taken them
before I told you where they were.

499
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,663
That's not why I did it.

500
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:42,604
- It's not, huh?
- I wanted him to look like a fool.

501
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,436
To feel like a fool.

502
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:51,910
Well, well. Looks like Johnny Locke's
got himself a nemesis.

503
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:59,779
Sun can never find out
what I did to her. Never.

504
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,187
Don't sweat it.

505
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,729
They got bigger things
to worry about now.

506
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,399
Sawyer.

507
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:19,034
This idea, all of this, what we did,

508
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,535
what made...

509
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:27,279
How does someone
think of something like that?

510
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,125
Now, go.

511
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,725
One Mississippi,

512
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,702
two Mississippi,

513
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,895
three Mississippi,

514
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,741
four Mississippi,

515
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,968
five Mississippi...

516
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,487
I'm not a good person, Charlie.

517
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,990
Never did a good thing in my life.
