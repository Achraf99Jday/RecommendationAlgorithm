-I'm coming, Walt. I'm coming.
- [Jack] Locke.

00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,926
John.

3
00:03:10,837 --> 00:03:13,271
Stay in there. Stay...

4
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,774
- Michael, what are you...?
- Stay in there, Jack!

5
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:19,903
- Hey, whatever's going on...
- Look, I'm going after my son.

6
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,746
I'm going after my son and nobody
is going to stop me, OK? OK?

7
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,217
That is my right.
That is a father's right.

00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:43,966

[metallic squeak]

11
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:03,545
Hey.

12
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:09,687
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing. Just getting some air.

13
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,095
Come on. We should talk.

14
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,139
- How many?
- Rifles and pistols? Eleven total.

15
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,541
- That's it?
- That's it.

16
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:29,912
- They took five of 'em right off us.
- How long to get to their camp?

17
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,747
We leave now, move fast,
middle of the night tomorrow.

18
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:37,546
They have no idea I know where they are.
They won't be expecting us.

19
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:41,185
So we get the guns and we go.
Right now, just the five of us.

20
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,387
No. Five's not enough.

21
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:44,930
You said there's
at least 20 of them with our guns.

22
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:48,263
- We're not sure if what you saw was...
- Hey, I know what I saw.

23
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,895
We take too many people,
they'll hear us coming.

24
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,599
I'm not taking a damn army
across the island.

25
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,403
Sure you're in the best place
to be making decisions now?

26
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:59,036
You got a son, Jack?

27
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:01,376
They're dead.

28
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,684
Ana Lucia and Libby are dead.

29
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,480
I mean, we haven't even buried 'em yet.

30
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,523
Me and you'll take Libby, OK?

31
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,169
- Can you...?
- Yeah. Of course.

32
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:32,234
- Sawyer, would you...?
- Yeah.

33
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,675
You should stay here.

34
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:38,780
We'll bury them tonight...

35
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,310
then we'll figure out what's next.

36
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:02,765
Hey.

37
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,566
Put your hands up.

38
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:07,629
Put 'em up. Don't move.

39
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:11,438
Relax, buddy. I ain't moving.

40
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:14,503
- Why don't you just put that...?
- Shut up.

41
00:07:16,116 --> 00:07:20,052
- You're WaIt's old man, aren't you?
- What?

44
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,470
Bag him, quick.
His friends are right behind us.

45
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,151
[water splashes]

46
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,095
Hello.

47
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:11,927
- I didn't hear you come in, man.
- I left my shoes outside.

48
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,131
They were muddy.

49
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:20,110
- Did you find him? Henry?
- No.

50
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:31,780
I hear you're a priest.

51
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,326
Yes.

52
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,955
Guess you believe in hell, then.

53
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:46,066
For a brief time,
I served in a small parish in England.

54
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,937
Every Sunday after Mass

55
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:52,739
I would see a young boy
waiting at the back of the church.

56
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,372
And then, one day,
the boy confessed to me

57
00:08:55,448 --> 00:08:58,884
that he had beaten
his dog to death with a shovel.

58
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:08,092
And he said the dog had bitten
his baby sister on the cheek,

59
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,152
and he needed to protect her.

60
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,998
And he wanted to know
whether he would go to hell for this.

61
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:21,433
I told him that God would understand.

62
00:09:21,507 --> 00:09:27,036
That he would be forgiven
as long as he was sorry.

63
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,348
But the boy did not care
about forgiveness.

64
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:37,411
He was only afraid
that if he did go to hell,

65
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,983
that dog would be there waiting for him.

66
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:04,209
[retches]

[gasps for air, coughs]

68
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,356
[Jack] Hey.

69
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:18,086
- You all right?
- Yeah.

70
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,826
I was coming back to check on you.

71
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:26,235
Yeah, man. I had to get out of there.

72
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:30,970
I just... I have to get my son back.

73
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,243
We're gonna help you do that, Michael.

74
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:37,841
It's gotta be the way I said, man.
Just the five of us.

75
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:40,545
Otherwise it won't work. It won't work.

76
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,885
- We're gonna figure that out.
- I have already figured it out.

77
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:46,357
It's gotta be just the people
who already know.

78
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,759
You, me, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley.
That's it.

79
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,390
Anybody else...
Look, it puts him in more danger.

80
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:56,526
You don't get to decide this.

81
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:59,400
It's my son. It's my call.

82
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,465
And that's the way it has to be.

83
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,674
Then that's the way it'll be.

84
00:11:22,862 --> 00:11:24,853
[baby coos]

85
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:29,065
Hey.

86
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,968
Hey, Aaron. Hey, big guy.

87
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,664
Hi.

88
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,279
- Have you seen Eko?
- No.

89
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,842
You know, we're building a church.

90
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,479
Is there something you want, Charlie?

91
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,449
Yeah.

92
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:58,457
I found something in the pallet
I thought you might need.

93
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,067
Vaccine?

94
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:08,699
I don't know what we need vaccine for,
but if anyone should have it,

95
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,766
you and the baby should.

96
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:14,370
It's all right.
It's a pneumatic injector.

97
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:18,110
You just put it into your leg,
and... [makes hissing noise]

98
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,352
it goes right in.

99
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,516
- Quite painless, really.
- You seem to know a lot about it.

100
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:27,317
I tried it.

101
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:30,851
I wanted to make sure it was safe
before giving it to you and the baby.

102
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,557
Well, how do you feel?

103
00:12:32,632 --> 00:12:34,623
I mean, did it do anything?
What did it do?

104
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,430
I don't know. I feel fine.

105
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,203
Anyway, it says you're supposed to
give yourself a shot every nine days.

106
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:48,407
All right? So, I mean, there's enough
here for you and the baby for a while.

107
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:50,540
That's it.

108
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,319
- All right. I'll put it...
- Yeah.

109
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,154
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

110
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,023
I should really feed him.

111
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:07,158
Yeah. Hey, Claire, do you think
maybe you and I could...?

112
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,633
Oh, my God.

113
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:13,263

- OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

120
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,745
It's good to see you, too.

121

Ana Lucia and Libby.

- [speaks Korean]
- What happened to them?

128
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,682
They were murdered.

Hey, there, Michael.

132
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,069
Not gonna hold that against you.

133
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,147
Fair's fair. I took your boy.

134
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,117
[chuckles]

135
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:10,019
- But don't do that again, OK?
- Where is he, you son of a bitch?

136
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:14,782
Hey, looky what I found.
She was following her friends.

137
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,828
They're about half a click behind us.

138
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,921
You make one sound...

139
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,165
you'll never see your boy again.

140
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:28,972
Gag him. Get ready with the torches.

141
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,032
I'm gonna go talk to her people.

142
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,308
- I think we'd better head back.
- What?

143
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,320
- Find the trail, John.
- I've lost it.

144
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,414
You don't just lose a trail.
You just don't want to find him.

145
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:49,587
That's right. I've been running through
the jungle toward the sound of gunfire

146
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,653
because I don't care about Michael.

147
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,199
You know what happens
if we turn around and go back?

148
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:55,894
We're never gonna see him again.

149
00:15:55,968 --> 00:16:00,962
And that's gonna be on us.
On you and on me.

[bearded Other]
You're exactly right, Jack.

151
00:16:05,978 --> 00:16:08,071
- Who are you?
- He's the son of a bitch

00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:11,605
- that shot me on the raft.
- Why don't you point the gun down?

153
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:17,979
It's OK. He's just delivering a message.

154
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:22,685
He has to scare your friends to do it.

155
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:26,129
- I don't believe you.
- You don't believe what?

I think there's more of us
than there are of you.

That's an interesting theory.

No.

00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,044
Bring her out, Alex.

163
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:53,249
- Go on.
- You.

164
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:56,193
- Come on, Alex.
- Please?

165
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,698
Let's go. Up. Up.

166
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:11,099
- Is Claire OK?
- [murmurs]

167
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:15,273
Did she have the baby? Is it OK?

168
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,872
Is it a boy or a girl?

169
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:22,476
Like I said, curiosity.

170
00:17:31,564 --> 00:17:33,964
You and me ain't done, Zeke.

171
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:58,651
His friends are going home.
Divvy 'em up.

172
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,195
Sorry.

173
00:18:14,206 --> 00:18:16,606
Hey. Hey.

174
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:40,989
What do you say, Doc?

175
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:46,099
And here I was thinking
the lrish drink when somebody dies.

176
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:49,369
- I'm not lrish.
- Neither am l.

177
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:55,344
So what happened
out there in the jungle?

178
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,746
Exactly what he said.
He found the camp...

179
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,115
I ain't talking about Mike.

180
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,177
You and Freckles.

181
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,053
Before you found him.
You were gone all night.

182
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,782
We got caught in a net.

183
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,885
What's the hell's
that supposed to mean?

184
00:19:10,963 --> 00:19:15,457
It means we got caught in a net.

185
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:18,526
That what they're calling it these days?

186
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,239
Is it true? Henry is gone?

187
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,301
- Yeah.
- Who's going after him?

188
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:30,109
- Locke and Eko went in the night.
- We ain't seen either of 'em since.

189
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:32,582
Those are the guns?
What are you doing with them?

190
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,620
What do you think we're doing?
It's time to finish this.

191
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,213
- When do we leave?
- In the morning.

192
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,316
You're not coming, Sayid.

193
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:43,953
- Excuse me?
- Michael wants to keep it small.

194
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,293
Me, Kate, Hurley and him.

195
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:49,892
Well even though Pippi Longstocking
and the damned Grape Ape

196
00:19:49,969 --> 00:19:52,301
are ideal candidates
for The Dirty Dozen,

197
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:54,339
we might wanna bring the Red Beret.

198
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,807
It's Michael's call.
He knows where we're going.

199
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:01,108
It is not his call, Jack. It's ours.

200
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:08,718
Welcome aboard.

201
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:36,245
[intermittent beeping]

202
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,222
[whirring]

203
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,132
So... you wake up
in the middle of the night,

204
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:02,105
grab your Jesus stick,
and race off into the jungle.

205
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:04,734
You don't call, you don't write...

206
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,974
I'm sorry. I had work to do.

207
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,346
Right. Yeah.

208
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:15,214
Charlie, would you do me a favor?

209
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:21,723
I was hoping you could
bring my things from the beach here.

210
00:21:21,794 --> 00:21:23,785
What for?

211
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:27,363
You moving in here?

212
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,833
Fancy yourself a little bachelor pad?

213
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:33,565
Yes, I am moving in here.

214
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:37,541
Well... what about the church?

215
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,238
You said we were supposed to be
building it together.

216
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:44,476
I am supposed to do
something different now.

217
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,280
And what am I supposed to do?

218
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:56,584
Bring me my things.

219
00:22:00,499 --> 00:22:03,559
- Bring your own things.
- Charlie, please.

220
00:22:03,636 --> 00:22:07,629
You'd better leg it, mate.
Clock's ticking.

221
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:25,288
Got some good news for you.
Captain Arab's in, too.

222
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:27,518
Cavalry rides at sunrise.

223
00:22:27,593 --> 00:22:30,460
- You told Sayid?
- Yeah, I told Sayid.

224
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,325
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:39,098
I figured if we're going to war, we'd
want the one guy who's been in a war.

226
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:41,162
That a problem?

227
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:48,443
No. It's not a problem.

228
00:22:49,581 --> 00:22:51,572
All right, then.

229
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:12,960
- Get off of me.
- You got a problem, Michael?

230
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,030
You march me a day and night
without any rest, yeah.

231
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,973
My problem is I'm tired.

232
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:21,274
Well, I'd offer to knock you out
and carry you, but we're here.

233
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,960
Put him right over here.

234
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,764
Tell her we're here.

235
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,707
I can't promise this won't hurt.

236
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,071
What the...? Ow! Damn it.

237
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:33,175
- Relax. Just taking some blood.
- Taking some blood? For what?

238
00:24:33,252 --> 00:24:35,720
Who are you people? Where's my son?

239
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,551
That's it. All done.

240
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:45,019
See you in the funny pages.

241
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:52,260
- Hello, Michael.
- Where's my son?

242
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,931
My name is Miss Klugh.

243
00:24:56,942 --> 00:25:00,503
I was hoping you might help me
answer some questions.

244
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:06,450
- About Walt.
- Where is he?

245
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:10,477
- Is he your biological son?
- What?

246
00:25:10,556 --> 00:25:14,117
- Are you his father?
- Yes, I'm his...

247
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:16,184
How old was he
when he started speaking?

248
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:18,923
I... He...

249
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,056
Did he have any illnesses growing up?

250
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,466
- Headaches? Fainting spells?
- What? No.

251
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:28,629
I don't... I wasn't there.

252
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,466
He was halfway around the world.
Why are you asking me?

253
00:25:32,544 --> 00:25:38,540
Did Walt ever appear
in a place he wasn't supposed to be?

254
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,153
You say he was halfway around the world,
but did you see...

255
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,523
I want my son.

256
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:51,586
You bring him to me right now.

257
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:54,188
I wanna see my boy.

258
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,202
For someone
who wants his son back so badly,

259
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,801
you don't seem to know
much about him, Michael.

260
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,385
[cocking of gun]

261
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,262
Hey. You're not coming.

262
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:30,860
- Welcome back, Michael.
- Look, I know Sawyer told you.

263
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:34,235
But it's not gonna work.
You're not coming.

264
00:26:34,306 --> 00:26:36,866
And why is it that I'm not coming?

265
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,968
Because you're going after
the guy who escaped,

266
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:42,138
and I'm going after my son.

267
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:46,310
Are you implying I'd let a desire
for revenge compromise WaIt's safety?

268
00:26:46,385 --> 00:26:51,516
I'm implying that I decide
who stays and who goes, and you stay.

269
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,525
I know you wanna help, right?

270
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:06,570
But I gotta do this my way.

271
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:19,082
Of course.

272
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,882
Good luck, Michael.

273
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:30,056
Yeah. Thanks.

274
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,466
Bloody hell.

275
00:27:58,023 --> 00:28:00,014
Are you kidding me?

276
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:05,262
Did someone put you up to this?

277
00:28:16,975 --> 00:28:17,999
Vincent?

278
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:51,528
You were supposed to come right back.

279
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:53,468
You were out all night.
What happened?

280
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,632
We were unable to find Henry's trail.

281
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:02,677
Yeah, I got that.

282
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:06,942
- Where's Locke?
- I do not know.

283
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:13,789
We're burying
Ana Lucia and Libby at sunset.

284
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,153
Thank you.

285
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,757
I will mourn them in my own way.

286
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:37,004
Who's gonna talk?

287
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:43,321
- What?
- At the funeral. Who's gonna talk?

288
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:47,416
I'm sure Hurley'll wanna
say something about Libby.

289
00:30:48,226 --> 00:30:51,457
I never even knew her last name.

290
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:54,288
Ana Lucia.

291
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:00,268
- It was Cortez.
- Cortez.

292
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,765
Well, there you go.

293
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,674
I screwed her.

294
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:16,953
What?

295
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,859
It's how she got my gun. Ana.
She jumped me.

296
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:28,025
We got caught in a net.

297
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,800
Why are you telling me this?

298
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,544
[sighs]

299
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:48,244
Because you're about the closest thing
I got to a friend, Doc.

300
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:54,525
And because she's gone.

301
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,664
Well, at least now
we get to kill somebody.

302
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:37,997
- Jack fill you in on the plan?
- What plan?

303
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:40,094
We're leaving first thing tomorrow.

304
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:43,163
Back across the island to their camp.

305
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:45,903
OK.

306
00:32:45,977 --> 00:32:48,969
And what about you, man?
You coming with us?

307
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,573
Why would I wanna go?

308
00:32:55,186 --> 00:33:00,385
- Because they killed her.
- Michael, come on.

309
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,584
What do you say, Hugo?

310
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:11,435
I'm sorry about Walt, dude,
but I'm not coming.

311
00:33:13,004 --> 00:33:15,564
- You're sorry about...
- Michael.

312
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,028
[quiet chatter]

313
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,607
[door opens]

314
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:03,380
Dinnertime.

315
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:12,990
When are you gonna do it?

316
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:16,465
- When am I going to do what?
- Kill me.

317
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:25,367
I've seen where you live.
I know how to get here.

318
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:30,972
You have been asking me questions
I don't know the answers to for a week.

319
00:34:33,017 --> 00:34:35,008
I don't even think my son is alive.

320
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:39,318
He is alive, Michael.
He's standing outside right now.

321
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:43,016
What, do you think I'm stupid?

322
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:48,288
There's been a development
since you came here, Michael.

323
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:50,857
One of our people was captured by yours.

324
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:54,234
- So go get him back.
- We can't do that.

325
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:59,037
But you can.

326
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,004
And, if you do...

327
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,850
we'll let you and Walt go free.

328
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,425
- I want to see my son.
- Michael...

329
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:21,363
I want to see him.
If he is out there, you bring him in.

330
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,430
You bring him in here right now.

331
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:36,104
Pickett.

332
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:42,586
[approaching footsteps]

333
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,747
You have three minutes.

334
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:54,690
- Walt?
- Dad.

335
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:58,031
Let him go. Let him go.
Get your hands off him right now.

336
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:02,095
- Dad, don't.
- Are you OK? Huh?

337
00:36:03,074 --> 00:36:06,669
- Yeah.
- Are you... Did they hurt you?

338
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,573
- They make me take tests.
- They make you what?

339
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,483
We're not gonna talk about that.

340
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:20,656
- How's Vincent?
- Well, Vincent's...

341
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,660
He's great.
He's great. He misses you.

342
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:26,490
Hey, don't be scared, man.

343
00:36:26,564 --> 00:36:28,896
Don't be scared.
It's gonna be over real soon.

344
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,959
- I'm gonna get you out.
- They're not who they say they are.

345
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,128
They're pretending.

346
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:36,230
- Want me to put you in the room?
- Pretending? Pretending what?

347
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:37,672
OK, that's it. We're done.

348
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:41,769
No, wait. Hey, wait, wait.
Come here, Walt. Wait, come here.

349
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:46,010
Dad, don't leave me.
Help me, please. Don't leave me.

350
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:49,084
I won't, man.
I'm gonna get you out of here, OK?

351
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,781
- I promise you. I will get you out.
- Dad! Dad!

352
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:55,155
- Let him go! Walt, wait! Let go of him!
- I love you!

353
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:58,127
- Walt, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- I love you!

354
00:36:58,196 --> 00:37:02,223
- I love you too, Walt.
- Put me down! Let me go! Dad!

355
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,459
I'll get you...

356
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:11,839
[sobs]

357
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,052
After you release our man,
I'm gonna need you to do something else.

358
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,251
[sobbing] I'll do it.

359
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,065
I'll do whatever you want.

360
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:41,436
I'm writing four names down.
Four of your friends.

361
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,497
We need you to bring them here.

362
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:51,914
You have to bring only these
four people, Michael. Just them.

363
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:59,249
If you don't bring
all the people on the list...

364
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,052
you'll never see Walt again.

365
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:08,262
OK. OK. OK.

366
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:13,468
Do you understand, Michael?

367
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,164
Yes. What do I tell them?

368
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,766
Doesn't matter.

369
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:22,176
Make up a story.

370
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:26,717
They'll be angry enough
to believe whatever you say.

371
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,286
Who's James Ford?

372
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,296
You know him as Sawyer.
You know the rest of them?

373
00:38:40,164 --> 00:38:41,358
Yeah.

374
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,762
I know them.

375
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:56,803
If I do all this...
If I do what you say.

376
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:59,213
You'll get your son back...

377
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:03,312
and you both go free.

378
00:39:11,629 --> 00:39:14,325
And I want the boat.

379
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:39,681
When the plane crashed, I was on my way
to Los Angeles to bury my dad.

380
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:42,447
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

381
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,717
It seems like such a long time ago now.

382
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,782
I was gonna go right from
the airport to the cemetery, but...

383
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:51,920
I had no idea
what I was gonna say.

384
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,260
And here we are again.

385
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,971
I think Michael has been compromised.

386
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:09,009
- Let's keep walking, Jack.
- What do you mean, compromised?

387
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,776
His actions are not those
of a man telling the truth.

388
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,348
Why would he lie to us?

389
00:41:14,418 --> 00:41:17,251
Because I believe
a father would do anything for his son.

390
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,949
Because I believe that Michael
may have freed Henry,

391
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:22,618
and because I believe
he's leading you into a trap.

392
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,558
You believe a lot, Sayid.

393
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:28,292
And I also believed
that Henry was one of them.

394
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:38,301
- All right. Let's go talk to him.
- No. He must believe he's in control.

395
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:42,836
- Why the hell would we wanna do that?
- So we can create an advantage.

396
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:50,679
- How?
- I don't know yet.

397
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:53,747
But we have one more night
to figure that out.

398
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,227
Ana Lucia Cortez was...

399
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:05,730
Before we crashed,
she was a police officer.

400
00:42:07,405 --> 00:42:09,930
I don't think it was
easy for her being here,

401
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:13,568
but I think she did the best she could.

402
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:18,877
She was a woman of few words
and I'm gonna follow her example.

403
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,918
Rest in peace, Ana.

404
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:39,426
Libby was...

405
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,338
She was...

406
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,934
She...

407
00:42:49,714 --> 00:42:52,046
Libby was a psychologist.

408
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,085
Or a psychiatrist.

409
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:05,193
One of those. Either way,
she probably helped a lot of people.

410
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:10,066
She helped me.

411
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:13,793
She was my friend.

412
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:18,235
It's not fair
that this happened to her. It's not.

413
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,218
I'm going with you.

414
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,520
Goodbye, Libby.

415
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:10,992
Boat.

416
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,588
Boat.
