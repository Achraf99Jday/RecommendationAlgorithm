1
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,003
-[Charlie] You see anything?
- [Kate] No.

2
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,608
- [Charlie] Maybe it's a trap.
- [Hurley] What do you mean, a trap?

3
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:14,703
[opera music plays faintly]

4
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,512
You hear that?

5
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,288
[gunshots]

6
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,861
[man] Damn it!

7
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,282
You.

8
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,888
[laughing]

9
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,340
[agitated chatter]

10
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:29,849
OK, OK, just wait one second, OK?
I'll be right back.

11
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,222
Everybody needs to know
what's going on. There's a boat...

12
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,624
Tell them Desmond's back,
until I find out the rest. OK?

13
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,706
So... before you ran off,

14
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,114
I guess you just forgot to mention
that you still have a sailboat.

15
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,144
Why'd you come back?

16
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:14,057
You think I did it on purpose?

17
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,124
I was sailing for two and half weeks,

18
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,761
bearing due west and making nine knots.

19
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,829
I should've been in Fiji
in less than a week.

20
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:30,865
But the first piece of land I saw
wasn't Fiji, was it? No.

21
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:34,846
No, it was here. This... this island.

22
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,582
And you know why?

23
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,143
Because this is it.

24
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:45,453
This is all there is left.
This ocean and this place here.

25
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,926
We are stuck in a bloody snow globe!

26
00:05:50,897 --> 00:05:54,355
There's no outside world.
There's no escape.

27
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:59,466
So just... just go away. Let me drink.

28
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:10,442
Are you still pushing it?

29
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:15,545
Yeah, we're still pushing it.

30
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,534
[sergeant] Set of keys.

31
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,899
One pocket watch, gold-plated.

32
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:33,564
One photograph.

33
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:44,748
One book: Our Mutual Friend.

34
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,881
Why didn't you bring that inside?

35
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,920
To avoid temptation, brother.

36
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,893
I've read everything Charles Dickens
has ever written.

37
00:06:55,962 --> 00:07:00,990
Every wonderful word.
Every book, except this one.

38
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:06,767
I'm saving it. So it will be
the last thing I ever read before I die.

39
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,207
Nice idea. As long as you
know when you're gonna die.

40
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,710
Lance Corporal Desmond David Hume,

41
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:19,479
your sentence is hereby complete,
and you are now and forever

44
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,789
Enjoy your sodding book.

45
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,809
You want a ride?

46
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,615
Not with you.

47
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:52,674
Get in the car.

48
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,258
Did you bring me a present?

49
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:11,428
Actually, two presents.

50
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:14,940
One of these boxes
contains your past, Hume.

51
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:19,604
The other, your future.
Go ahead. Open it.

52
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,689
You're a bastard, you know that?

53
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,787
The fact that she never received your...

54
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,355
Your sentiments is good for her.

55
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:44,767
Good because, as far as she's concerned,
you've forsaken her.

56
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:48,069
- And that's the way it's going to stay.
- Is it now?

57
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:53,304
Penelope's moved on, Hume.
She's getting married.

58
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,190
This is for your new life,
away from my daughter.

59
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:11,457
The conditions are simple.

60
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:15,467
No contact. No calls. No post.

61
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:19,869
You just... run away, Desmond.

62
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:26,141
And what makes you think
I would just run away?

63
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:31,779
Because you're a coward.

64
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,487
[Sayid] On the way to the funeral,

65
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,496
I told you that Michael
had been compromised by the Others.

66
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:48,500
And then you asked me how
we might take advantage of that.

67
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:53,267
I believe fate
has given us our answer: the boat.

68
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,636
The boat.

69
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,733
This camp Michael
is leading you to across the island,

70
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,142
that is where they will set their trap.

71
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:04,240
While Michael leads you by land,
I can approach far more quickly by sea,

72
00:10:04,317 --> 00:10:06,808
and I can go ashore undetected.

73
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,553
- Go ashore and do what?
- Scout them.

74
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,490
Their numbers and positions.
Their weapons.

75
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,723
Then I'll go to the nearest beach
and start a signal fire with these.

76
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:20,197
They burn with a dark black smoke.

77
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,895
You and your team
will come to meet me at the signal,

78
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,438
and we will go in together.

79
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:29,907
We're not even sure
if Michael's been turned by them.

80
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,103
He has been turned.

81
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:38,108
I'll have to tell Kate and Hurley
and Sawyer what we're doing...

82
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:42,712
No. Michael cannot sense
we know he is lying.

83
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:46,156
All we have
is the element of surprise, Jack.

84
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:50,218
Right now, it's only
your responsibility to keep it secret.

85
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,293
Black smoke, huh?

86
00:10:56,636 --> 00:11:00,697
This time,
they will know that we are coming.

87
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:13,118
Hello, John.

88
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:16,211
Where have you been?

89
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,191
I've been thinking.

90
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,023
About what?

91
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:29,223
That in a minute,
that computer's gonna start beeping.

92
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:32,362
And when it does,
you're gonna let it go.

93
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:36,101
You're gonna let it
run down to zero, past zero,

94
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,040
and you're not gonna push the button.

95
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:42,675
But I am going to push the button.
Why wouldn't l?

96
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:44,876
Because you don't want to be a slave.

97
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:50,747
- I am a slave to nothing.
- You're a slave to that.

98
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:53,951
- [beeping]
- Just like I was.

99
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,393
So I'm gonna tell you again...

100
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,693
...don't push it.

101
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,370
Do not tell me what I can do.

102
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,506
You cannot push that button!

103
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:16,412
[grunts]

104
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,223
No, it's not real! We're only puppets!

105
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,818
Puppets on strings!

106
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,330
As long as we push it,
we'll never be free.

107
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,060
Well, you're free now, John.

108
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:38,297
- Do not come back.
- No.

109
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,115
No way. If I take that,
I'm gonna kill someone.

110
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,159
Ain't that the point?

111
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,285
I thought the point
was to get Walt back.

112
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,423
What's the matter?

113
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,371
All that stuff
we found in the medical station.

114
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,966
Costumes, makeup, fake beards.

115
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:19,034
They want us to think
they're hillbillies.

116
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:21,774
Listen. Listen, I was there.

117
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,817
I saw them.
They are hillbillies. They live in huts.

118
00:13:24,884 --> 00:13:27,751
They eat fish. They're probably
more scared than we are,

119
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,152
and they have no idea we're on our way.

120
00:13:32,892 --> 00:13:37,090
All right. Enough jibber-jabber.
Let's roll.

121
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,454
I need your boat.

122
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:12,097
I wouldn't waste your time.
There's nothing out there, pal.

123
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:16,568
I'm not going out there. I need to
get to the north shore, and quickly.

124
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:19,935
- Off to see the hostiles, are you?
- The what?

125
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:23,908
You know what? Ignorance is bliss.

126
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:28,540
The boat's all yours, brother.

127
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:31,549
For all the good it'll do you.

128
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,448
I don't know how to sail.

129
00:14:37,256 --> 00:14:39,383
Then I suggest
you find someone who does.

130
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:51,870
Just give me whichever one
has the most caffeine in it, brother.

131
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,202
Ah, damn.

132
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,969
I'm sorry, I've just arrived,

133
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:03,140
and I spent
all my American money on a taxi.

134
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:04,581
I've got it.

135
00:15:06,752 --> 00:15:09,516
- That's not necessary.
- It's just four bucks.

136
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,323
I don't suppose you have
42,000 more of those, do you?

137
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,260
- Depends on what it's for.
- I was joking.

138
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,957
No, you weren't.

139
00:15:20,766 --> 00:15:24,361
A solo sailing race around the world?

140
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:27,895
I've got eight months
to get into the best shape of my life.

141
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:30,875
But I'll tell you what, miss.
I'm going to win.

142
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,207
And what do you get if you do?

143
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,114
What really matters...
is who I win it from.

144
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,520
"Charles Widmore."

145
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,423
He tried to buy me off,

146
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:50,223
and when I didn't take his money,

147
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:54,027
he took away the only thing in the world

148
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,091
that I ever truly cared about.

149
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,794
Who is she?

150
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,404
His daughter.

151
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:07,141
I was unsuitable on several levels.

152
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,308
And what's the 42 grand for?

153
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:12,851
It's a wee bit complicated.

154
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:16,012
As of yet, I don't actually have a boat.

155
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,521
Sorry, did I say something wrong?

156
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:28,600
I have a boat.

157
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:36,431
It was my husband's, but... he got sick.

158
00:16:38,878 --> 00:16:42,541
He wanted to sail to the Mediterranean,
but he never...

159
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:54,283
He passed away... about a month ago.

160
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:00,190
I'm sorry.

161
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:08,264
I want you to have it.

162
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,344
I...

163
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:16,540
- I can't take your boat, miss.
- But you have to.

164
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,146
He'd want you to.

165
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,222
What was your husband's name?

166
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:38,397
David.

167
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,366
And what did he name his boat?

168
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:46,568
Elizabeth.

169
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:51,314
He named it after me.

170
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,722
Then I thank you, Elizabeth.

171
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:06,422
And I shall win this race... for love.

172

Would you excuse us, please?

175
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,244
I'll be at the shore.

[in Korean]

177
00:19:25,778 --> 00:19:27,803
Don't even think about it.

178
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,943
It's a trap. A net.
Rousseau's got 'em all over the island.

179
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:36,112
How the hell would you know that?

180
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,214
I kind of tripped one with Jack.

181
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,988
We ended up... Never mind.

182
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,319
[chuckles]

183
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,692
What?

184
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:49,961
When the doc told me
y'all got caught in a net,

185
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:54,233
I thought he meant... something else.

186
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:59,536
And since when did you and Jack
start talking about me?

Did that bird just say my name?

191
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:30,231
Yeah, it did...
right before it crapped gold.

192
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:44,954
Sorry, man.
I guess I forgot to load that one.

193
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:47,117
Want to hand me the mag?

194

[man sobbing]

195
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,680
John?

196
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:21,926
What happened to your face?

197
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,963
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- Hey...

198
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,625
...if you're feeling
a little sorry for yourself,

199
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:34,867
you may want to have a drink
with your mate from the hatch.

200
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,932
I hear he's a little despondent as well.

201
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,074
- What?
- Oh, that's right.

202
00:21:41,146 --> 00:21:44,912
You weren't there
for the dramatic arrival at the funeral.

203
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:47,919
I think he's pushed your button
too many times, if you ask me.

204
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:54,318
- Desmond?
- Yeah, Desmond.

205
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:57,226
I'm sure you two
have a lot to talk about.

206
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:17,572
I'm sorry if what I said was confusing,
but I asked Jin to come.

207
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:22,117
You need someone to translate,

208
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:25,156
and you need at least two people
who know how to sail.

209
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:29,661
- Desmond managed by himself.
- And look where he ended up.

210
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:47,442
[Desmond] You're wasting your time,
sister.

211
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:51,813
I shot myself with that stuff
every nine days for three years.

212
00:22:57,589 --> 00:22:59,386
He's lovely.

213
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,857
Is the... is the father
here on the island?

214
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,591
No.

215
00:23:06,665 --> 00:23:09,225
Nope, he's been gone a long time.

216
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:13,738
Just sort of walked off the moment
he got a bit scared by the situation.

217
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:19,101
Well, maybe he knew he'd be a lousy dad.

218
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:22,472
Thought he was doing
what was best for you.

219
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:26,050
He was doing what was best for him.

220
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,022
How did you find me?

221
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,694
Landlord at your flat
told me you ran here...

222
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,604
- How did you find me?
- I have a lot of money, Desmond.

223
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,473
With money and determination,
you can find anyone.

224
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:36,353
Did you read your beloved book?
The one you were saving?

225
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,482
Not yet.

226
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,729
I thought you might have read it
while you were away.

227
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:48,665
I was in prison. Not away.

228
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,733
Why didn't you write to me?

229
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:07,285
When are you getting married, Pen?

230
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:14,152
We haven't set a date yet.

231
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:18,595
- I'll be back in a year.
- What if you were back right now?

232
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,689
I'm going to win this race, Pen.

233
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:28,336
His race. And in a year, I'll be back.

234
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:48,118
Desmond, what are you running from?

235
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:55,728
I have to get my honor back...

236
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:00,828
...and that's what I'm running to.

237
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:20,924
So, what did one snowman
say to the other snowman?

238
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:24,286
Smells like carrots.

239
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,957
- Hello, Desmond.
- Hello, yourself, Box Man.

240
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:35,031
- Do you mind?
- Oh, I insist.

241
00:26:38,644 --> 00:26:41,135
So you managed
to fix the computer then, did you?

242
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:44,582
The world's still here, ain't it?

243
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,619
I'm not so sure about that, brother.

244
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:49,210
Refresh my memory, Desmond.

245
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:54,692
How long did you say
that you were down there in the hatch?

246
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,285
Three years.

247
00:26:57,362 --> 00:27:01,924
Desmond, what if I told you
that... for all that,

248
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,197
all those years
that you and all the men before you

249
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,433
were down there pushing that button...

250
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,268
What if I told you
it was all for nothing?

251
00:27:14,046 --> 00:27:18,983
I'd ask you how the hell
did you know something like that.

252
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:21,986
I found another hatch.

253
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,055
Another station on the island.

254
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,385
They called it The Pearl.

255
00:27:29,027 --> 00:27:31,461
And I saw a film there.

256
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,024
An orientation film, and it said
that everything that was happening

257
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:40,128
in our hatch... wasn't real.

258
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,036
That it was a test.

259
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:48,068
A psychological experiment.

260
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:51,074
You're lying.

261
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:06,926
You want to take a walk?
I'll make the popcorn.

262
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,298
If you're so sure it's not real,

263
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:13,065
then just stop pushing the button.

264
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:16,301
Well, I have, except, unfortunately,

265
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,639
someone else decided to start.

266
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:22,805
So you're gonna sober up.

267
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:27,273
And we're gonna get
a good night's sleep, and tomorrow,

268
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:31,652
we're gonna find out what happens
if that button doesn't get pushed.

You shouldn't be out here alone.
I'll... I'll give you a hand.

00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,798
Every 1 08 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

325
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:07,674
From the moment the alarm sounds,

326
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:13,115
you will have four minutes to enter the
code into the micro-computer processor.

327
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:19,320
How many times you
gonna watch that thing?

328
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,654
Why are there missing parts?

329
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:23,990
Radzinsky made some edits.

330
00:36:24,062 --> 00:36:25,393
Who's Radzinsky?

331
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:30,524
- He was my partner.
- What happened to him?

332
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,332
Just make sure you put that back
behind Turn of the Screw

333
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:34,871
when you're done with it.

334
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:37,741
Why do you wear that suit?

335
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:41,006
So I don't get infected out there.

336
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:52,485
Give yourself a shot of this
every nine days.

337
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,855
You were out there a while
before I found you.

338
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,486
I hope it's not too late.

339
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:05,498
- [Eko pounding] John! Open this door!
- Who is he, Box Man?

340
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,936
The man out there pounding on the door.

341
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:10,372
His name is Mr. Eko.

342
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:13,410
Why does Mr. Eko carry around
a stick covered in scripture?

343
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:16,447
- Because he's a priest.
- [Eko] Open the door, please.

344
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:18,106
Don't do this.

345
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:22,278
[pounding] John! Can you hear me?
Open up!

346
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:25,015
- We locked out a priest?
- John!

347
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:10,696
Charlie, do you know how
they got the hatch door open?

348
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,032
No, but if you hum it,
I could probably play it.

349
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:15,766
How did they open it?
The door that says "quarantine."

350
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,469
- They blew it up. Why?
- Charlie, I need your help.

351
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,978
Oh, now I'm back
in your good graces, Father?

352
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,480
Charlie, John
has locked me out of the hatch,

353
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:28,315
and I believe he is doing this because
he is going to stop pushing that button.

354
00:38:28,386 --> 00:38:32,618
And Charlie, I am absolutely certain
that if he is successful,

355
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,148
in 90 minutes
everyone on this island will die.

356
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:43,230
- All right, I'm in. I'm in.
- Thank you. Come on, quick.

357
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:50,165
So these Others, you think they're
left over from the Dharma folk?

358
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:54,541
- I don't know, man.
- My theory? They're aliens.

359
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:58,673
That's why they use the fake beards.
Their heads, made of plastetic.

360
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,115
Prosthetic, dude.

361
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:02,675
You can't even spell,
and now you're correcting me?

362
00:39:02,754 --> 00:39:06,417
- What do you think, Freckles?
- Keep moving, we're being followed.

363
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:09,221
- What?
- Just keep smiling.

364
00:39:12,697 --> 00:39:15,666
There's at least two of them
across the river.

365
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,531
In five seconds,
I'm gonna turn the tables on them.

366
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:21,436
- Well, wait a second.
- You in?

367
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:32,847
Hey!

368
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,721
[Kate] He's getting away.

369
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,699
- He's dead. We have to find the other!
- [Jack] No.

370
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:57,206
- I'm going. Sawyer...
- I said no!

371
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:59,869
Crazy? They'll know we're coming.
He'll warn them.

372
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:02,435
It doesn't matter if we catch him now.

373
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:09,717
They've already been warned.

374
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:14,249
What do you mean, "warned"?

375
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:19,591
Why don't you tell them, Michael?

376
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:22,656
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- Stop lying!

377
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,869
- Tell them.
- Tell them what? I...

378
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:37,277
I know what you're doing, Michael!
Now, tell them the truth!

379
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,179
- Jack.
- Tell them!

380
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,414
It was the only way.

381
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,055
They gave me a list.

382
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,620
What list?

383
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,860
It had your names on it.

384
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:02,502
I had to bring all four of you back,
or they said I'd never see my son again.

385
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:07,334
- Who are they?
- It's like I said.

386
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:10,869
They live in a camp with huts, and...

387
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:13,280
I swear, that's it.

388
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,645
You let Henry go?

389
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,888
Did you kill them?

390
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:29,726
Ana Lucia... and Libby.

391
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:35,196
Did you?

392
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,076
I had to.

393
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:45,916
I couldn't find any other way,
and Libby was a mistake.

394
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,781
I didn't have time to think.

395
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:53,222
But if you did have time...

396
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,222
...you still would've killed her, right?

397
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,291
I'm sorry.

398
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:08,803
You understand, I am sorry.

399
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:10,898
I'm sorry.

400
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:15,475
I... It's my son.

401
00:42:22,086 --> 00:42:23,519
I'm going back.

402
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,322
No, Hurley.

403
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,520
Hurley, you can't.

404
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:35,188
We're gonna get killed.
You knew it and let us come anyway.

405
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:39,100
It's too late to go back now, Hurley.
We caught them following us once.

406
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,071
If they don't believe we trust Michael,
they'll kill us all.

407
00:42:44,675 --> 00:42:47,109
I'm sorry that I didn't say anything.

408
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:51,375
You have to know
that I would never bring you out here

409
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,041
if I didn't have a plan!

410
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:57,150
What plan?

411
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,621
[Sayid speaking in Arabic]

412
00:43:33,224 --> 00:43:34,851
Sayid!

413
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:42,293
There.

414
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:46,269
[Sayid] That's the rock
Michael described.

415
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:50,269
We're here.

416
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,673
- Wait. Please.
- Wait, Hurley showed me.

417
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:02,310
It's around here somewhere.
It's definitely... around...

418
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:04,616
It's...

419
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,419
- We're running out of time, Charlie.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

420
00:44:07,692 --> 00:44:09,387
Here it is!

421
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:14,622
Told you. Be careful. Be careful.

422
00:44:14,699 --> 00:44:18,328
Dynamite is very unstable.
You don't wanna end up like Dr. Arzt.

423
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:27,002
Careful.

424
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:31,205
Eko. Hey! Eko.

425
00:44:32,216 --> 00:44:34,309
Listen.

426
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:39,652
What if we hurt them?
Or blow up the computer?

427
00:44:39,724 --> 00:44:41,191
You can leave now, Charlie.

428
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:48,189
John? It's Charlie.

429
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,199
Let's work this thing out, John.

430
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,629
John! Eko is very upset, John.

431
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:57,640
Let's just open this door,
and we can talk about it.

432
00:44:59,276 --> 00:45:03,007
John, you should know Eko
is gonna blow open the blast door.

433
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,048
Blow it open with what?

434
00:45:05,116 --> 00:45:07,914
With dynamite from the old ship
in the jungle!

435
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:12,613
It would take an atom bomb, brother.
Tell him not to bother.

436
00:45:13,324 --> 00:45:15,121
You're sure it'll hold?

437
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:19,856
Aye. I'm sure.

438
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:33,738
You ready?

439
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,245
- Maybe you should do it.
- Come on, Des.

440
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:38,713
You've seen me do it a hundred times.

441
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:58,666
[woman over PA] Six. Five. Four.

442
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:01,671
Three. Two. One.

443
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:04,299
- [bell rings]
- [metal scraping]

444
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:20,821
How do you even remember
where you left off from?

445
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:25,624
Slowly, Des. Very, very slowly.

446
00:46:32,636 --> 00:46:35,537
You should've seen Radzinsky do this.

447
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:38,769
He had a photographic memory.
This whole baby was his idea.

448
00:46:38,843 --> 00:46:41,107
Yeah, right, Radzinsky.

449
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:43,510
Radzinsky figured out
how to fake a lockdown.

450
00:46:43,581 --> 00:46:47,540
Radzinsky created
this great invisible map.

451
00:46:47,618 --> 00:46:50,052
More and more tales
about your former partner,

452
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:54,023
yet for some reason you never want
to tell me what bloody well happened.

453
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:03,931
See that brown stain there?

454
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,963
That's Radzinsky.

455
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:13,939
He put a shotgun in his mouth
when I was asleep.

456
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:20,216
The bitch of it was I only had 1 08
minutes to bury the poor bastard.

457
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,958
Well, if you don't want me to go crazy,

458
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:32,689
next time let me go out.

459
00:47:32,763 --> 00:47:36,597
Oh, you want to go out there
with the quarantine and the hostiles?

460
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,795
I haven't been outside
for two bloody years!

461
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,031
I want to go! I was in the army,
for God's sake!

462
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:45,769
Oh, right. Her Majesty's Army, correct?

463
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:50,371
Tell me, Desmond, why did you leave
that nice old lady's army?

464
00:47:50,447 --> 00:47:55,043
Oh, I remember now. You got kicked out
because you couldn't follow orders.

465
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,314
And why did you leave your army,
Kelvin, huh?

466
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,853
Because men followed my orders.

467
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:06,556
But then, thank God,
I joined the Dharma lnitiative.

468
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,361
"Namaste, thank you, and good luck."

469
00:48:10,434 --> 00:48:12,299
Ha, ha, ha.

470
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:14,867
Please, Kelvin.

471
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:20,607
Let me go out. Just once.

472
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:26,943
Sorry, Des. You stay here.

473
00:48:27,017 --> 00:48:31,249
You push the button. That's an order.

474
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:40,962
John! Look, seriously,
you're about to be detonated!

475
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:52,272
Hey. What if John's right?

476
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:54,903
Maybe it's just some colossal joke.

477
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:58,540
You know, it's just
some old computer connected to nothing.

478
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:01,107
Maybe it's just a bunch of wires that...

479
00:49:10,027 --> 00:49:11,619
Is that a joke?

480
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,432
I'll see myself out.

481
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,139
[Eko] John!

482
00:49:28,212 --> 00:49:30,908
This is your last chance to end this.

483
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:34,374
Open the door, and I will forgive you.

484
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,578
Forgive me for what?

485
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:47,120
Hey.

486
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:51,065
Hey, Eko? Wait.

487
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:53,433
Just wait a second.

488
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,972
I don't...
I don't think it's a good idea, Eko.

489
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,032
We're in a very confined area.

490
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:06,312
Oh, bollocks.

491
00:50:19,596 --> 00:50:22,064
[alarm sounding]

492
00:50:25,069 --> 00:50:27,162
Kelvin!

493
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:30,129
Hey, Kelvin!

494
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,558
[muffled singing]

495
00:50:58,435 --> 00:50:59,697
[sighs]

496
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:07,910
I couldn't do it.

497
00:51:09,012 --> 00:51:11,105
I couldn't do it.

498
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:20,316
What is this?

499
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:23,554
This is the only other way out, partner.

500
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:26,653
- What are you talking about?
- Fail-safe.

501
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,723
Just turn this key,
and this all goes away.

502
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:37,271
What's behind that wall, Kelvin?

503
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:39,271
Huh?

504
00:51:40,077 --> 00:51:41,271
What was the incident?

505
00:51:42,413 --> 00:51:46,747
Electromagnetism. Geologically unique.

506
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:51,049
The incident? It was a leak.

507
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:55,057
So now the charge builds up
and every time we push the button,

508
00:51:55,125 --> 00:52:00,085
it discharges it.
Before it gets too big.

509
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:06,693
Why make us do it? Push the button?

510
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,203
If we can just...

511
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:09,864
[laughing]

512
00:52:14,945 --> 00:52:19,006
Now here's the real question, Desmondo:

513
00:52:19,082 --> 00:52:24,076
Do you have the courage
to take your finger out of the dam,

514
00:52:24,154 --> 00:52:26,816
blow the whole thing up instead?

515
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:34,928
I think your friends
just blew themselves up, brother.

516
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,425
They're not my friends.

517
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:42,939
I can't hear anything.
Maybe we should open it.

518
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:46,908
No! No. It's a trick.

519
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:50,879
A trick? They could be hurt.

520
00:52:50,948 --> 00:52:52,176
Is your doctor around?

521
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:55,946
Well, our doctor is...
God knows where.

522
00:52:56,019 --> 00:53:00,786
I... And he sure as hell doesn't care
about anything happening down here.

523
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:07,087
- Can I ask you a question, brother?
- Absolutely.

524
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,929
Is the reason
you're letting that clock there

525
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:16,200
run all the way down
to the very last tick...

526
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,868
Is it because you need
to look down the barrel of a gun...

527
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:22,343
...and find out
what you really believe, John?

528
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:28,613
I looked down the barrel of the gun.
And I believed.

529
00:53:29,553 --> 00:53:31,282
I thought...

530
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:37,890
...it was my destiny
to get into this... place.

531
00:53:37,961 --> 00:53:41,863
And somebody died. A kid.

532
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:45,732
Because he was stupid enough to believe
that I knew what I was talking about.

533
00:53:45,802 --> 00:53:49,033
And on the night he died for nothing,

534
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:53,099
I was sitting right up there all alone,

535
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:58,204
beating my hand bloody
against that... stupid door.

536
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:02,776
Screaming to the heavens,
asking what should I do.

537
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:05,083
And then a light went on.

538
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:09,290
I thought it was a sign.

539
00:54:12,996 --> 00:54:15,055
But it wasn't a sign.

540
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,429
Probably just you
going to the bathroom.

541
00:55:20,364 --> 00:55:22,798
[knocking]

542
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,064
Jack.

543
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:19,717
What are they?

544
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,304
It's handwritten.

545
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:39,569
And it's all filled. The whole book.

546
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,736
They're journal entries.

547
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:48,081
"0400. S.R. moves
Ping-Pong table again.

548
00:56:48,151 --> 00:56:52,087
041 5. Takes a shower." What is this?

549
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:54,020
Hey, doc?

550
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:58,027
What'd you say Sayid's sign was when the
coast was clear to hit that beach party?

551
00:57:00,497 --> 00:57:02,590
That means he found them, right?

552
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:04,566
[Jack] That's miles from here.

553
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:12,270
- Where were you taking us?
- What?

554
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:15,402
Sayid said he'd light the signal
so we'd meet him at the shore.

555
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:17,709
- Why aren't we going to the beach?
- We are.

556
00:57:17,781 --> 00:57:19,874
- We're nowhere near the beach!
- I had to.

557
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,076
- What?
- l...

558
00:57:21,418 --> 00:57:23,409
[indistinct whispering]

559
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,055
- [electric buzzing]
- [Kate] Sawyer!

560
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,132
[grunting]

561
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,895
Run! Go! Go!

562
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:47,609
Hold on. Wait!

563
00:57:52,616 --> 00:57:55,380
Ah! Ah!

564
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:05,558
[grunting]

565
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:31,684
Tell me about this other hatch
you found. This... Pearl.

566
00:58:31,755 --> 00:58:35,282
- What do you want to know?
- Details.

567
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,590
The Pearl is a psychological station
full of TV monitors.

568
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:42,257
And two men sat in viewing chairs

569
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:46,325
and filled notebooks with observations
on what happens in here.

570
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:49,236
And then they put
the notebooks in pneumatic tubes

571
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:52,469
that sent them to their headquarters
so they could evaluate us

572
00:58:52,542 --> 00:58:54,305
as an experiment.

573
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,504
Jeez...

574
00:59:01,084 --> 00:59:02,483
What?

575
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,648
- What if you've got it backwards?
- Backwards?

576
00:59:06,723 --> 00:59:10,454
What if the experiment wasn't on the two
men here, but on the two men in there?

577
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:12,654
- I want to see that tape.
- No, you can't.

578
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,720
There's no way to see it down here.

579
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:17,631
Was there anything else
in that station? A computer?

580
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,862
- Yeah.
- So, what did it do?

581
00:59:19,936 --> 00:59:23,702
Nothing! It didn't do anything.
It printed out numbers. Lots of numbers.

582
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:25,172
- Where is it?
- Here.

583
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:29,440
Reading material for the next
1 9 minutes. Knock yourself out.

584
00:59:45,128 --> 00:59:48,063
[Kelvin] You've been shaving
for the last three years.

585
00:59:49,132 --> 00:59:52,033
You need to live a little. Let go.

586
00:59:52,102 --> 00:59:53,899
I'm never gonna let go, brother.

587
00:59:56,473 --> 01:00:00,239
Oh, that's the spirit. Goodbye, Des.

588
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:05,406
Goodbye?

589
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:12,720
Yeah. Goodbye.
See you in a couple hours.

590
01:02:25,388 --> 01:02:28,585
Well, gosh. I didn't think
you had the stones to come after me.

591
01:02:31,461 --> 01:02:34,487
I was a spook for ten years, Des.
I know when I'm being followed.

592
01:02:34,564 --> 01:02:38,000
- What are you doing with my boat?
- I'm fixing it.

593
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:40,663
You were leaving?

594
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:43,433
Well, I mean, not yet.
She's still about a week away.

595
01:02:43,506 --> 01:02:45,440
You wrecked her pretty good, Des.

596
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:49,711
So, what do you think?
Want to come with me?

597
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:53,077
Come where?

598
01:02:53,149 --> 01:02:54,411
What about the button?

599
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:59,744
Screw the button, man.
Who knows if it's even real?

600
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:02,792
That's not what you said when
you were going on about dams

601
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:06,761
- and electromagnetics and fail-safes!
- Well, I was drunk.

602
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,058
Why did you lie to me?

603
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:12,227
I lied to you because I needed
a sucker to save the world after I left.

604
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:14,964
- You're crazy! You bastard!
- Come on.

605
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:17,939
You stole my life!
What else did you lie to me about?

606
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:19,804
- What else? Tell me!
- Easy.

607
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:22,468
[grunting]

608
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:27,506
- How could you do this to me?
- [groans]

609
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:28,608
Get up.

610

- When did you come here?
- What?

621
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:24,025
The island. When did you come here?
How long ago?

622
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,728
- Sixty, 65 days.
- The date! What was the date?

623
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:28,065
September 22nd.

624
01:05:31,307 --> 01:05:33,798
It was September 22nd.

625
01:05:41,484 --> 01:05:43,611

[muffled] It's fake.

- Sorry, missy. I didn't get you.

She says she knows
your beard's fake, Tom.

Well, thanks
for pointing that out, Kate.

I can't tell you
how much this thing itches.

01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:28,851
Hello, again.

639
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,999
Where's your beard?

640
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:41,760
I think they know.

641
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,880
All right.
Let's take care of business, shall we?

642
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:07,122
[ears ringing]

643
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:09,255
[coughing and groaning]

644
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:26,573
Eko?

645
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:28,814
Eko.

646
01:08:31,187 --> 01:08:32,677
[grunts]

647
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:37,486
It's Charlie. Wake up!

648
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:40,258
[beeping]

649
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:44,029
- We need to push the button.
- No, we don't.

650
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,398
Did you not hear me?
I crashed your plane.

651
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:47,868
How did you manage to do that?

652
01:08:47,937 --> 01:08:50,531
On that day, those numbers
turned to hieroglyphics.

653
01:08:50,606 --> 01:08:53,473
When the last one came down,
this place started to shake.

654
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:55,909
That screen filled up
with "system failure."

655
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:58,105
"System failure." And that number there:

656
01:08:58,181 --> 01:09:03,448
92204. September the 22nd, 2004.
The day your plane crashed. It's real!

657
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:05,919
It's all bloody real!
Now push the damn button!

658
01:09:05,988 --> 01:09:10,084
I know what I saw!
It's a lie! It's not real!

659
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:11,888
None of it is real!

660
01:09:11,961 --> 01:09:14,259
You don't want to push the button?
Then I will.

661
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:15,729
No!

662
01:09:28,411 --> 01:09:30,379
You've killed us.

663
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:33,008
You've killed us all.

664
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:37,542
No. I just saved us all.

665
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:45,387
- [bell rings]
- [metal scraping]

666
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:52,831
Hey! Eko! Wake up.

667
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:55,796
Hey! Hey!

668
01:09:55,872 --> 01:09:57,840
Can I get some help? Can you help me?

669
01:09:57,907 --> 01:10:00,000
I'm trying, brother!

670
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:52,019
[Penelope] Dearest Des.

671
01:10:52,094 --> 01:10:55,359
I'm writing this letter
to you as you leave for prison.

672
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,991
And I've hidden it
in the one place you would turn to

673
01:10:58,067 --> 01:11:01,298
in a moment of great desperation.

674
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:05,238
I know you go away with the weight
of what happened on your shoulders.

675
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:08,675
And I know the only person
who can ever take it off is you.

676
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,243
Please don 't give up, Des.

677
01:11:13,316 --> 01:11:18,083
Because all we really need to survive
is one person who truly loves us.

678
01:11:18,955 --> 01:11:21,355
And you have her.

679
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:23,756
I will wait for you always.

680
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:27,023
I love you, Pen.

681
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,059
It's all gone.

682
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:39,200
It's all gone.

683
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,440
It's all gone!

684
01:11:51,354 --> 01:11:54,812
It's all...! It's all gone!

685
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,518
It's all... It's all gone.

686
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:01,095
All gone!

687
01:12:09,305 --> 01:12:11,535
[soft banging]

688
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:26,148
[man, muffled] This was supposed
to work!

689
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,318
[wailing]

690
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:37,027
You weren't...

691
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:43,129
I've done everything you wanted me
to do, so why did you do this?

692
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,070
Why?

693
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,969
[sobbing]

694
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,754
[alarm sounding]

695
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:27,809
Three days before you came down here,
before we met,

696
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,181
I heard a banging on the hatch door,
shouting.

697
01:13:30,252 --> 01:13:32,652
But it was you, John, wasn't it?

698
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:35,520
You say there isn't any purpose?
No such thing as fate?

699
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:38,719
But you saved my life, brother.
So that I could save yours.

700
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:41,388
Don't! No! No! None of this is real!

701
01:13:41,464 --> 01:13:44,558
Nothing is gonna happen!
We're gonna be OK!

702
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:48,602
I've got to go, and you've got to get
as far away from here as possible.

703
01:13:48,671 --> 01:13:52,266
- Go where? Stop!
- I'm gonna blow the dam, John.

704
01:13:53,843 --> 01:13:57,301
I'm sorry for whatever happened
that made you stop believing.

705
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:59,006
But it's all real.

706
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,851
And now I've got to go
and make it all go away.

707
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,511
Wait! Desmond?

708
01:14:07,089 --> 01:14:09,387
I'll see you in another life, brother.

709
01:14:12,361 --> 01:14:14,226
[woman over PA] System failure.

710
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,491
[rumbling]

711
01:14:16,599 --> 01:14:21,093
Eko! Eko! Wake up!

712
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:24,928
Can you move? Hey, come on.

713
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:28,743
You all right?

714
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:06,509
Oh, my God!

715
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:10,377
- Come on! Come with me!
- Charlie.

716
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:14,889
- No! Hang on!
- Get out of here! Go!

717
01:15:17,126 --> 01:15:18,684
Eko!

718
01:15:25,801 --> 01:15:26,893
John!

719
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:46,950
I was wrong.

720
01:16:08,611 --> 01:16:13,480
[Penny] All we really need to survive
is one person who truly loves us.

721
01:16:13,549 --> 01:16:15,574
And you have her.

722
01:16:15,651 --> 01:16:20,054
I will wait for you always.

723
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,385
I love you.

724
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,725
I love you, Penny.

725
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:33,432
[mechanical groaning]

726
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:39,263
[sound pulsating]

727
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,439
Charlie!

728
01:17:58,687 --> 01:18:00,211
You OK?

729
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:02,814
[loudly] It's hard to tell
exactly, Bernard.

730
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,223
My ears... You know?

731
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,694
Where's Locke? Eko?

732
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:11,062
- They're not back yet?
- No.

733
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:25,979
I'm not happy about the arrangement
that was made with you,

734
01:18:26,048 --> 01:18:29,415
but we got more than we bargained for
when Walt joined us.

735
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:32,921
So I suppose this is what's best.

736
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:37,155
And you let me go. Set me free.

737
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:39,923
You lived up to your word.

738
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:45,759
We live up to our word too.

739
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:50,495
- You know how to drive a boat?
- I can drive a boat.

740
01:18:50,572 --> 01:18:54,736
Good. You're gonna take this boat
and follow a compass bearing of 325.

741
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:59,645
And if you do that exactly,
you and your son will find rescue.

742
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,047
What, that's it?

743
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:04,813
I follow the bearing,
and me and my son get rescued?

744
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,411
Yes.

745
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:10,883
How do you know I won't tell people
about where I was?

746
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:16,322
Maybe you will, and maybe you won't.

747
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,865
But it won't matter.

748
01:19:17,933 --> 01:19:21,596
Once you leave,
you'll never be able to get back here.

749
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:25,106
And my hunch is you
won't say a word to anybody.

750
01:19:25,174 --> 01:19:29,611
Because if you do, people will find out
what you did to get your son back.

751
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:39,248
My friends.
I was promised you wouldn't hurt them.

752
01:19:40,656 --> 01:19:42,317
A deal's a deal.

753
01:19:46,862 --> 01:19:49,353
Who are you people?

754
01:19:51,266 --> 01:19:53,427
We're the good guys, Michael.

755
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:03,411
All right. She's all yours.

756
01:20:03,879 --> 01:20:06,404
What? What, am I stupid?
Where is my son?

757
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:08,575
WaIt's inside.

758
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:14,212
Walt?!

759
01:20:15,591 --> 01:20:17,491
Bon voyage, Michael.

760
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,621
Walt!

761
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:25,792
Dad! Dad!

762
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:28,393
Come here. Come here.

763
01:20:42,317 --> 01:20:43,579
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

764
01:20:43,652 --> 01:20:46,849
You sure? OK. I got you now.

765
01:20:46,922 --> 01:20:49,288
It's gonna be OK, now.
We're going home, Walt.

766
01:20:49,358 --> 01:20:51,451
We are going home.

767
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:10,641
[grunts]

768
01:21:15,651 --> 01:21:18,916
Hugo, you can go back to your camp.

769
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:22,251
What?

770
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:25,451
Go back.

771
01:21:25,527 --> 01:21:28,394
Your job is to tell
the rest of your people

772
01:21:28,463 --> 01:21:30,363
they can never come here.

773
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:33,401
But what about my friends?

774
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,202
Your friends are coming home with us.

775
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:46,238
Go.

776
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:05,122
[boat engine starts]

[fire crackling]

778
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:25,912
What happened out there, Charlie?

779
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:29,744
You want to hear the part
about me nearly being killed

780
01:23:29,818 --> 01:23:33,515
by the flaming fire ball
or the flying fork?

781
01:23:33,588 --> 01:23:36,421
I want you to be serious.

782
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,428
Nothing happened.

783
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:43,223
Well, something happened.

784
01:23:43,298 --> 01:23:47,325
I mean, that noise, and the sky
turned that weird violet color.

785
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:49,370
Did it?

786
01:23:55,644 --> 01:23:57,339
- Ooh.
- Ow, ow.

787
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:45,818

- [woman] Hello?
- Ms. Widmore?

01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:07,041
- Yes?
- It's us.

794
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:11,369
I think we found it.
