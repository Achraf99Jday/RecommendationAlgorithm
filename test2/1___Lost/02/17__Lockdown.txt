[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,471
I met my real father. Great news, right?

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:08,598
He pretended to love me
just long enough to steal my kidney.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:12,133
I followed you last night.
Is it your father's house?

5
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:15,579
Promise me that you're not
gonna go to that place anymore.

6
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,809
All right.

7
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:21,047
You think you're the first person
that ever got conned?

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,852
You needed a father figure
and I needed a kidney.

9
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:28,121
- Hey, Helen...
- You're gonna have to choose.

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,355
Him or me.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:36,424
My name is Henry Gale.
I'm from Minnesota.

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,734
You draw up a map to your balloon.
We go out there, we find it.

13
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,569
If I mess up, they'll crucify me.

14
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,905
Do you or do you not know where it is?

15
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,411
I went back there to bury my wife.

16
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,243
- It's to his balloon.
- This is at least a day's walk.

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,341
- Then we should get going.
- This is where he said it would be.

18
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,852
We need to be sure.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,186
If I was one of them, these people
that you seem to think are your enemies,

20
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:03,924
there'd be no balloon, so I'd draw a map
to a real secluded place.

21
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,491
And when your friends got there, a bunch
of my people'd be waiting for them.

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,033
I guess it's a good thing
I'm not one of them, huh?

So, what did I do to deserve this?

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,263
What? Can't a fella take his girl
out for a picnic lunch just 'cause?

26
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:48,068
"Fella"?

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,201
That's right. Fella.

28
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,877
So, where you taking me?

29
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,510
I'm not telling, so just quit asking.

30
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,986
Can I be of any help?

31
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,354
You just read your obituaries
and drink your coffee

32
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,122
and I'll take care of the everything.

33
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:13,154
Don't knock the obits;
it's the nicest part of the paper.

34
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,760
No one ever says anything mean
about people once they're dead.

Mm. And here I am thinking the funnies

John, what's your father's name?

38

- Why?
- Is it Anthony? Anthony Cooper?

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,785
Yes. That's right.

40
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,556
He's dead.

41
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,371
Draw it again: The map to your balloon.

44
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,958
I was just frustrated.
It was a stupid thing to say. I'm sorry.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,296
It's too late anyway.
She's already long gone, Jack.

46
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,201
- So, what's done is done?
- That's right.

47
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,168
Put him back in the armory.

48
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,285
Why do you let him
talk to you like that?

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,761

- Shut up.

Maybe he's wrong. We should
search the other side of the cliff.

54
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,853
We've been searching for three hours.
This balloon does not exist.

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,862
- Charlie!
- Then why'd he draw the map?

56
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,161
You said you'd protect him
whether we found the balloon or not.

57
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:32,227
You've given him two more days to stall,
to figure out how to escape.

58
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,205
We're done.

He said he buried her, right? His wife?

00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,295
Why isn't it raining here?

64
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:40,170
Hurley, have you seen Ana Lucia?

65
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,174
She took off into the jungle
with Charlie and Sayid yesterday.

00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,231
Yesterday?

67

She say anything about
where they were going?

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:53,110
Well, that would, like, assume
anybody actually tells me anything.

69
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,178
Maybe if I were in the loop,
I could be more helpful.

70
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,655
There is no loop, Hurley.

71
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:03,685
Excuse me, Jack. He's been really hot
and fussy. Do you mind having a look?

00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,095
- Yeah. Sure, sure.

- Completely.

You're not just saying that, right?
You seem a bit distracted.

Well, doesn't look infected.
A little Neosporin wouldn't hurt.

Yeah. Right. Neosporin.

00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,191
What do you want from me?

163
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:07,069
I killed myself off because there are
two men who were going to beat me to it.

164
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,575
Oh! What did you do, steal their livers?

165
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:16,411
No. I took them for 700,000 dollars.
Retirement con.

166
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,749
I put the money in a safe deposit box,

167
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,916
but these two guys might be sitting
on the bank to see if I show my face,

168
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:31,019
which is why I need you to go in there
and get it for me.

169
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,400
Do you think I'm stupid?

170
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,067
I want you to take 200 grand of it.

171
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,145
It won't make up for what I did to you,

172
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,307
but it's the best I can do.

173
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:58,285
I'll be at the Flightline Motel, near
the airport, until tomorrow afternoon.

174
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,690
And then I'm gone, money or no money.

175
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,991
And, John, if I don't see you again...

176
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,597
I'll understand.

177
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,974
We're locked in.

178
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,141
What?

179
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,688
These blast doors came down.
The whole living area is sealed off.

180
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,523
I can't get out.

181
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,792
- Did you try to pry...
- Yeah, but I couldn't...

182
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,000
Maybe...

183
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,932
- Maybe if the two of us...
- You want me to help you?

184
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,611
Yeah.

185
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,883
And if I do help you
get these doors up...

186
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,954
then you're gonna lock me back in here,
aren't you?

187
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,162
That's right.

188
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,967
Then I'm going to need your word, John.

189
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:25,171
I'm gonna need your word that you
won't let your people do anything to me.

190
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,236
If you're who you say you are,
what are you worried about?

191
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:32,647
Things have happened to them,
things that I had nothing to do with.

192
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,779
But they've got no one to blame,
except for me.

193
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,817
So, I'm gonna need your word...

194
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,453
that you'll protect me.

195
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,258
No matter what.

196
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,240
Who are you?

197
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,947
My name is Henry Gale.

198
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,151
I'm from Minnesota.

199
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,355
And I crashed on this island
just like you.

200
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,696
All right. You have my word.

201
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,517
- Dude, you got me.
- I'm out.

202
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,880
Think you're in my head, Doc?

203
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,288
You've still got three papayas.

204
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,417
Call or fold.

205
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,156
Well, you're in trouble now, Cool Hand.

206
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,562
Pocket Queens makes me a set.

207
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,473
Kings wired.

208
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,475
[Hurley] Whoa, dude.

209
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,470
But at least I'm not in your head.

210
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,619
- Well, I guess that's it.
- What do you mean, "it"?

211
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,814
Sawyer, you're busted. I got it all.

212
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,859
Wouldn't be fair for you
to go and pick more mangoes.

213
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,622
Well, I got a hell of a lot more
than mangoes.

214
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,925
You wanna play real stakes? Name 'em.

215
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,958
- It's a pile of fruit, man.
- And I want it back.

216
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,799
Should I go and get a ruler?

217
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,708
Fun time's over, Mongo.
Why not hit the buffet?

218
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,710
- But, I wanna...
- [Kate] Come on.

219
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,542
Let's go.
Leave these boys to their sandbox.

220
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,947
One more hand, Doc.

221
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,046
What's it gonna take?

222
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,287
The medicine you stole from the armory.

223
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,055
All of it.

224
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,804
OK.

225
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,007
[Locke] Ready? One, two, three.

226
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,409
[grinding]

227
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,379
[both strain]

228
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,149
Let's go.

229
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,884
[both strain]

230
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,316
[Locke] Harder!

231
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,754
[Henry strains]

232
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,762
[Henry groans] I'm losing it!

233
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,697
The tool box!
Get the tool box. I'll hold it.

234
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,137
- You sure?
- Get it!

235
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,569
Come on! Come on! Put it under!

236
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,767
John, wait. Don't you think...

237
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,570
[Locke screams]

238
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,399
You have to stop the door.

239
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,944
Put something else under the door!

240
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,003
Come on, come on!

241
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:29,787
Stack 'em, stack 'em.
You have to stop the pressure.

242
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,550
Come on, come on, come on!

243
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,092
[Locke moans]

244
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,494
All right, all right. Let's get you out.
Let's get you out, come on.

245
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,762
No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

246
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:50,000
All right, we'll wait until somebody
comes down. All right?

247
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,979
It's only a matter of time. Yeah?

248
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,479
No, we don't have time.

249
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,983
Honey.

250
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,021
Put on your Sunday best.

251
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,195
- I'm taking you out to paint...
- John...

252
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,136
We have visitors.

253
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,802
Um...
These men say they knew your father.

254
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,778
Hi, John, I'm Jimmy Bane.

255
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,317
- I didn't really know him.
- She told me.

256
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,153
But I'd like to ask you
a couple questions, if that's OK?

257
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,357
Sure. Of course.

258
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,521
Have you seen your father since he died,
Mr. Locke?

259
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,725
How... Have l...?

260
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,260
Well, we were thinking possibly
he's not dead. And maybe you know that.

261
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:31,037
I mean, for his son, you didn't look
too shook up at his funeral.

262
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:36,072
How dare you? If you had any idea
what that man did to him,

263
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,912
- what that son of a bitch...
- Hey, Helen, Helen.

264
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:44,445
We were there to get past him,
to get on with our lives, to let him go.

265
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:50,023
- Get out of here.
- OK, OK.

266
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,788
Just one thing before we go.

267
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,758
What's in the bag, John?

268
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,503
Work papers and stuff,
I'm a home inspector.

269
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,241
You mind if we take a look?

270
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,996
Well. There you go.

271
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,100
Thanks for the coffee, miss.

272
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,191
[sighs]

273
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,926
Helen, I'm sorry. Are you OK?

274
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,560
Were you lying to those men, John?

275
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:09,404
No, I was scared. I was...

276
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,369
I was scared.

277
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,988
So, where'd you learn
to play cards, Doc?

278
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,631
Phuket.

279
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,463
What the hell
were you doing in Thailand?

280
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:42,631
What, you don't think
I know where Phuket is?

281
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:47,644
Just 'cause I dropped out of ninth grade
don't make me an idiot.

282
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,978
Far East, huh? I wouldn't have
taken you for a world traveler.

283
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,382
That where you got
the art on your shoulder?

284
00:25:56,421 --> 00:26:00,221
- How about you deal again?
- What?

285
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,493
This time from the top of the deck.

286
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,895
Well, I had to try.

287
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,795
[Locke breathes heavily]

288
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,712
- What does it do?
- We're not exactly sure.

289
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,048
- And you push it...
- Every 1 08 minutes, yeah.

290
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,644
- How soon does this alarm go off?
- Very...

291
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,556
Which is why I need you to go up
through the grate and into the vents.

292
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,618
- Grate's bolted shut. I tried.
- Yeah.

293
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,358
There's a grate in the pantry.
Get through there.

294
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,593
Take the vent into the dome.

295
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,732
- Maybe we should wait for...
- We can't. It'll go off any minute.

296
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:55,241
I trusted you, Henry. Now you gotta
trust me. That button has to be pushed.

297
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,543
OK. What do I do?

298
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,179
Once you're inside,
you'll hear the alarm beeping.

299
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,312
And you just have to enter the numbers:

300
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:10,259
4, 8, 1 5, 1 6, 23, 42.

301
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,592
And then you press "execute."

302
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,565
Exactly those numbers
in exactly that order.

303
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,658
Do you...

304
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:20,227
4, 8, 1 5, 1 6, 23, 42.

305
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,000
- I got it.
- Go.

306
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,404
All right.

307
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,978
Can you reach it?

308
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,981
I think so.

309
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,415
[groans]

310
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,262
Be careful.

311
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,268
Henry!

312
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,432
[beeping]

313
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,643
Henry!

314
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,752
[Libby] What's going on?

315
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,817
Jack and Sawyer
are finally gonna beat each other up.

316
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,860
Ten mangoes.

317
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,827
OK.

318
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,861
I'll call you with the aspirin,
and raise you a bottle of Amoxicillin.

319
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,271
Do you even know what Amoxicillin is?

320
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:37,679
You may have been to Phuket, Doc,
but I been to Tallahassee.

321
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,845
Let's just say something was burning
and it wasn't from the sunshine.

322
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,290
I'm all in.

323
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,488
Well, that's the move of a man
who wants me to lay it down.

324
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,829
You're not gonna lay it down.

325
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,563
I'm not, huh? Why's that?

326
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,841
Because there's a bunch of people
watching us right now

327
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,274
and you don't want them to see you lose.

328
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,936
Again.

329
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,348
Well, all right.

330
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,186
I call. What you got?

331
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,259
A pair of nines?
You pushed in with a pair of nines?

332
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,860
You caught me. Let's see 'em.

333
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,966
[sighs]

334
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:40,137
- Guess it was enough, huh?
- Son of a bitch.

335
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,337
I'll come get the meds later.

336
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,180
Hey.

337
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,954
When I asked you what you wanted for
stakes, why didn't you ask for the guns?

338
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,952
When I need the guns...
I'll get the guns.

339
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,564
[beeping]

340
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,936
[beeping continues]

341
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,565
[Locke] Henry?

342
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,801
Get up, damn it!

343
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,609
Henry!

344
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:24,517
- Henry, are you all right?
- What happened?

345
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,023
Listen to me,
you have to get up into the vents

346
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,959
and enter the numbers in the computer.

347
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,361
- How long was l...
- Please! Go right now.

348
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,456
We're running out of time.

349
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,194
OK. Yeah.

350
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,134
Be careful!

351
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,777
Henry?

352
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,747
[alarm]

353
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,087
Henry, can you hear me?

354
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,600
Henry?

355
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,370
Henry?

356
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,752
[airplane engine]

357
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,456
[Cooper] Yeah, who is it?

358
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,365
It's John.

359
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:55,742
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

360
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,419
- Any problems?
- No.

361
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,395
Your date at my funeral, she got a name?

362
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,133
Helen.

363
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:21,266
That's a nice name. Pretty girl, too.

364
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,603
I'm...
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

365
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:34,610
- Tonight, actually.
- Well, good for you.

366
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:36,381
Congratulations.

367
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,517
Yeah, thanks.

368
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:46,286
Your share.
Should buy you a nice honeymoon.

369
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,800
I didn't do this for the money.

370
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,400
Then why did you do it?

371
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,673
Well... All right.

372
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,909
My plane... I got a cab waiting.

373
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:13,185
You don't want the cash,
the maid's gonna get a hell of a tip.

374
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,258
Bye, John.

375
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,273
Are you him?

376
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,337
Listen, sweetheart, l...

377
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:42,608
How could you?
How could you do this to him?

378
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,354
We were moving past this!

379
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,333
Helen, wait.

380
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,232
You don't understand.

381
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,274
- I was gonna tell you.
- You lied.

382
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,810
- I can explain.
- You looked me right in the eye

383
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,574
and you lied to me.

384
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,048
You've made your choice, John.
You need his love more than mine.

385
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,177
No! My choice is you. I was gonna...

386
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,484
I love you. I...

387
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,992
No, no, please, please. Please, Helen...

388
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,087
Please. I love you
and I want to spend my life with you

389
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,725
and I can't live without you, Helen.

390
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,402
So, will...

391
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,498
So...

392
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,669
Will you marry me?

393
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,902
Helen...

394
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,333

Henry!

401
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,252
[motor stops]

402
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,625
Please say something.

403
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,456

Henry!

407
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,318
Henry?

408
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,527
Anybody here?

409
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,363
Is anybody here?

410
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,098
Henry!

411
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,443
You came back.

412
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,748
What, did you think
I was gonna leave you here?

413
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:45,023
- Come on. Can you stand?
- I don't...

414
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,630
I think so.

415
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,802
[Locke groans]

416
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,880
Thank you, Henry.

417
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,312
Thank you for not leaving me.

418
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,047
You're welcome, John.

419
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,198
[Kate] Hey. Hey, Jack. Wait up.

420
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,332
You heading back to the hatch?

421
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,964
Yeah.

422
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,169
Mind if I join?
It's been a while since I had a shower

423
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:37,806
- and I was just hoping that...
- Actually, the plumbing's busted.

424
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:40,282
- Busted?
- The water's been running muddy.

425
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:45,186
I guess we got a cracked pipe, but it's
gonna take some time to find it.

426
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:49,317
Oh. Well, I guess I wasted a trip then.

427
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,191
Well, I'll let you know as soon as we
get things worked out down there.

428
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,664
OK.

429
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,795
I'm glad you beat Sawyer.

430
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,508
You know what?
The hatch can wait until morning

431
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,208
if you'd like me to walk you
back to the beach.

432
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,955
- Do you see that?
- Yeah.

433
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,443
[Jack] It's a parachute.

434
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,080
Wait.

435
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,655
It's food.

436
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,490
[rustling]

437
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,031
What the bloody hell is that?

438
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,945
What did you find?

439
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,045
I gotcha. Easy, easy.

440
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,626
- [Locke groans]
- Sorry.

441
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:44,404
What did you do? What did you do
to end it and make the doors go up?

442
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:47,435
I did what you told me to.

443
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,503
I punched in the code
and I pressed the "execute" button,

444
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,641
but nothing happened
other than that clock flipping back.

445
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,483
I was just climbing back into the vent
when the lights went out.

446
00:40:57,555 --> 00:41:00,490
Ten seconds later the doors went up.

447
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:04,025
I didn't do anything.

448
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:07,222
You think it was all just random?

449
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,100
Don't look at me. It's your hatch.

450
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,761
Get away from him.

451
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,467
- Wait, you don't...
- Step back, right now.

452
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,339
- Sayid, it's OK.
- I said, get away!

453
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:24,973
It's all right. I let him out. There was
some kind of lockdown or something.

454
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,381
He was helping me.

455
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,289
- Couldn't you find my balloon?
- Yeah. We found it.

456
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,883
We did find your balloon, Henry Gale.

457
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:39,225
Exactly how you described it.

458
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,629
We also found the grave you described.

459
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,896
Your wife's grave.

460
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:49,303
The grave you said you dug
with your own bare hands.

461
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,468
It was all there.

462
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,374
Your whole story. Your alibi.

463
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,310
It was true.

464
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,548
But still I did not
believe it to be true.

465
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,485
So, I dug up that grave...

466
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,958
and found that there was not
a woman inside, there was a man.

467
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,830
A man named Henry Gale.
